I'm dining for this hotel tonight

30
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,920
She didn't see me clean down the stairs to have a free

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,760
She told me that I wanted to come in my bedroom

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,560
That's the sweetener

33
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,520
So I'll be tickled save the floor

34
00:02:50,080 --> 00:03:07,760

Everything

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Everything

62
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,760
To

63
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
The

64
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,760
New

65
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,760
Earth

66
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
By

67
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:27,960
The

68
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,760
Arch

69
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
A

70
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,760
Then I'll never let the sleep, then I

71
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,760
So I'll be tickled, say it in the door

72
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,760
Underneath is the breath of snow

73
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,760
Why?

74
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,760
Who would have been wouldn't have been

75
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,760
If Daddy had already seen

76
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:00,760
My feet get sick and I'm not left

77
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,760
I wouldn't have been wouldn't have been

78
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,760
If Daddy had already seen

79
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:17,760
My feet get sick and I'm not left

80
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,760
No!

81
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,760
It doesn't get more yanky due to the mat

82
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,760
Twist and sister

83
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,760
I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus

84
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Hey!

85
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,760
We've had thanksgiving

86
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
It means it's time to focus on the holidays

87
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,760
Christmas

88
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,760

DailySourceCode episode 503

94
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Coming to you from once again

95
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Just a beautiful Northern California

96
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,760
At the Curry condo in San Francisco

97
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,760
Yesterday the sun was out shining

98
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,760
Blue skies, not a cloud

99
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Same thing today it's fantastic

100
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,760
And of course had to get up really early

101
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
And be at the stores at 5am

102
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760
Is this something new?

103
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
I don't remember this from last year

104
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
I certainly don't remember from living in the States

105
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,760
But black Friday which is today

106
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
The day after Thanksgiving

107
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Which is the last Thursday in November

108
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,760
I think so

109
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
That's the day when all the sales are on

110
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
Everyone goes shopping

111
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
And it's called black Friday because the stores

112
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Essentially pull their balance sheets

113
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,760
Into the black by selling so much stuff

114
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
So there's great bargains

115
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,760
But everywhere I saw promoted people going to

116
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
Let's show up at the store at 5am

117
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,760
I hope your Thanksgiving was good

118
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
If you celebrate that in the US

119
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,760
Or indeed in Canada although you already celebrated it earlier than we did

120
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,760
So hope it was good

121
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
Hope you had a fun time with family

122
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,760
You're probably just rolling over about now

123
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Because of course no one is working today

124
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,760
I knew that my day was going to be funky yesterday

125
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
It started off with a phone call

126
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
Hey Adam, it's me Jousel

127
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,760
I can't really get into it

128
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
But I just got here in San Francisco

129
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,760
It's about 7 o'clock on Thursday

130
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,760
And I have to figure out what I'm going to do

131
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
And when I do figure it out

132
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,760
I will give you a call

133
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Goodnight

134
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,760
So that was Jousel who would

135
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,760
Already threatened that she was

136
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Sorry that she was going to come up

137
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,760
And that's the last I heard of her yesterday

138
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,760
So I hope everything's okay with her

139
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,760
I was actually at the office at 2 o'clock yesterday

140
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,760
I was invited over to Rosy and Kimo's house

141
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Rosy works at Potcho

142
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Her husband Kimo is in free accident and grittle

143
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
And so it was like 12 people

144
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
It was really really nice

145
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,760
People who I guess maybe had nowhere else to go

146
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
And they put on a real feast

147
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,760
It was just fantastic

148
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,760
And Sue and Kevin Kevin

149
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,760
Both also work at Potcho

150
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
They were also going to go over to Rosy

151
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
So I said well you know what?

152
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Instead of taking Bart

153
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,760
Which is what is the Bay Area Rapid Transit System

154
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,760
I said why don't we fire up Trinity

155
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
You know we're loading that we got bottles of wine

156
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
And some desserts and stuff

157
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,760
And we'll load it all up and we'll go across the bridge

158
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Into Oakland

159
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,760
And we'll have a big adventure

160
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Actually I think I said a big adventure

161
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,760
So we agreed to meet at the office at 2 o'clock

162
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,760
And I'm kind of like looking around

163
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
Because I'm thinking you know

164
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,760
Yeah I'm waiting for Sue and Kevin

165
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,760
But what if Giselle's angry boyfriend shows off

166
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Hey, I don't know who this is

167
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,760
But stop fucking calling Giselle asshole

168
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,760
So I didn't

169
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,760
There's more people who are pissed to me by the way

170
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
I don't know who the fuck you are

171
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
But stop calling what you're asshole

172
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
And I had the Tom Tom Navigator

173
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
All programmed ready to go

174
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
So here's what happens

175
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,760
So the office is on second street

176
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
So we basically swing around

177
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
Go up past the condo again

178
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Up onto the Bay Bridge

179
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
And we're maybe

180
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Three minutes onto the bridge

181
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
And I can feel it

182
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
I'm like Guy's something's wrong

183
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Because I'm losing power

184
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
Not that Trinity has

185
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
I should actually I should do

186
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Shoot now

187
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
I don't even have the Trinity jingle here

188
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Well

189
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
I said I'm losing power

190
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
And it was like it was

191
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
It was literally that I was losing power

192
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
So I put on the hazards

193
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
I'm in the left hand lane

194
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
Because I just kind of got onto the bridge

195
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
And she starts slowing down

196
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
And I'm pumping the gas

197
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
And I'm trying to figure it out

198
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
And I'm putting it into lower gear

199
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
I'm putting it into neutral

200
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
And so I kind of get it going again

201
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
And if you know the Bay Bridge

202
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
You can get off at Treasure Island

203
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,760
And so I kind of got the car going again

204
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
And we're driving along

205
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
And some of this consists of me restarting

206
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
While rolling along

207
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
It was really the weirdest thing

208
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
And I'm looking at the eyes

209
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
And I'm like out of fuel

210
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Because I had at least a quarter tank left

211
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
So I think the fuel gauge was correct

212
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Because that's really what it felt

213
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Like fuel starvation to the engine

214
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,760
And you know so we're rolling

215
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
And then it's like look we can get off at Treasure Island

216
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,760
The exits on the left hand side of the bridge

217
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
And then we can roll all the way down to safety

218
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
And on all of a sudden she caught again

219
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
And like I'm making a decision

220
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
We're going for it

221
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,760
And we're off and okay we're it's a long bridge

222
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,760
And so we emerge from the bridge

223
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
This is the point where the GPS has to kick in again

224
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Because we've been under this metal structure

225
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
And I don't know where to go

226
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
And for some reason of course

227
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,760
The GPS decides to reboot

228
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
So we miss the exit

229
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,760
And we have to get off the freeway

230
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Circle around come back

231
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,760
And on an inclined up the freeway

232
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
It starts

233
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
Dying again

234
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,760
So I'm doing my series of restart

235
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
And everything and I kind of were kind of limping along

236
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
And it's really busy

237
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,760
And you know I'm not making no friends

238
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
So we finally pull over

239
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,760
And perfectly you know with a gas station right across the road

240
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
A call box right in front of us

241
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
And Rosie had actually

242
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
When I got Trinity head said you know he had just

243
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Take this triple a card you know you never know

244
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
And I'd stuck it in my wallet

245
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
And I'm so happy I did

246
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Because I call them

247
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
After actually

248
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,760
Getting two gallons of diesel fuel across across the road

249
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
From the gas station

250
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
Which was not the answer

251
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
I think the fuel pump went

252
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
And you can see pictures at curry.com

253
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
I posted some flicker pictures there

254
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
I think actually the show up on atom.podshow.com

255
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
As well automatically you'll see some pictures

256
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Of Trinity being hoisted up

257
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
Our buddy Charles

258
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,760
It was there

259
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,760
I kid you not in under ten minutes

260
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
And he drove us right to Rosie's house

261
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
And so it was like happy Thanksgiving

262
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Rosie here's here's my car

263
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
It's now in front of your house

264
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
Without to go figure it out

265
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
So

266
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
Rest in peace there Trinity

267
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
We'll patch her up of course

268
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
But I'm now a little bit worried

269
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,760
I have some significant trust issues

270
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
With Trinity at this time

271
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,760
And I'm really just not sure

272
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,760
How a relationship is going to unfold

273
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
I don't know this though

274
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,760
If you like maybe you ate a little bit too much yesterday

275
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Do the exercise with us

276
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
Help from Adam

277
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
Thank you for coming

278
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Thank you Amy

279
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,760
I'm sure you're still full from how they food yesterday

280
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
It's going to keep the move smaller today

281
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Oh thank you very much

282
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
That's good

283
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,760
We'll head and switch your mic

284
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
Okay

285
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
I'm going to stay on this one if you don't

286
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
We're going to be working on the floor today

287
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Let me put it on the floor then

288
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
Okay

289
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Lay down on your right side

290
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Okay

291
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
Use your right arm to prop your head up

292
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
Okay

293
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,760
Now take your left leg

294
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,760
Lift it

295
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
Bend the knee

296
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,760
And bring it over the right leg

297
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,760
And set your foot down in front of you

298
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Oh

299
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
It can land anywhere between your right knee and hip

300
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
So much for sexy poses

301
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Okay you'll twist it up and go

302
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Yes I am now what do I do

303
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
Good

304
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Now flex your toe and lift the leg towards the ceiling

305
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Oh

306
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,760
And back down

307
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
Okay

308
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
Yes

309
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
Just like that

310
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Seven more

311
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,760
You can put your left arm in front of you for support if you'd like

312
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
Five

313
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Try to keep those hip stacks

314
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
So you're at leaning forward or backward

315
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
Two

316
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Good

317
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
Okay

318
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
Untamed yourself and roll over

319
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Then place the right leg over the left on the floor in front of you

320
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Yes

321
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Okay

322
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
Now lift the left leg

323
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Eight times

324
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Okay

325
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Remember to breathe

326
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
Make sure you're squeezing your stomach

327
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
And butt

328
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Which is exactly where you should feel this

329
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
And also in your legs

330
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
All right

331
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
Great job

332
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
I'll let you get back to your holiday veggie now

333
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Don't forget

334
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760

Thank you

343
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,760
I'm feeling much better now

344
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,760
Much better

345
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
Actually hit the button by accident

346
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
I wanted to say something before this hit you

347
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
Plus

348
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
Four

349
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,760
Four

350
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
Two

351
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,760
Seven

352
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Six

353
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,760
One

354
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
Three

355
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,760
Four

356
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
Four

357
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Two

358
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Seven

359
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Five

360
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
Three

361
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Five

362
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
I was going to say

363
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,760
That there's an awesome video that Jill Mills and Robert Dolby produced

364
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
And they put it up

365
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,760
It's behind the scenes at podcastcon

366
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
UK 2006

367
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
You can find it at podcastcon

368
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
UK.podshow.com

369
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,760
It's actually quite long

370
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,760
It's about an hour and ten minutes

371
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,760
But I was blown away by what these two put together

372
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,760
If you want to know what's happening in the podcast scene

373
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
In the UK

374
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
Check this out

375
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Very pleasantly surprised

376
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,760
And this hour flew by

377
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,760
And I'm typically not anyone who can

378
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,760
Excuse me

379
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Sensei I was blind up

380
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,760
I'm not someone who can

381
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
You can really sit through anything

382
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
I can't sit through an album

383
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,760
I can't, I can't, an hour worth of anything

384
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
It's very hard for me

385
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,760
As part of the ADD

386
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,760
And but it just flew by

387
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,760
It was really, really excellent

388
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,760
And I'm thinking these two kids

389
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
These two wacky kids

390
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
They got to do some more stuff like this over in the UK

391
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Of the luck going on

392
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
I was really, really pleased to see this

393
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Because I think it did encapsulate

394
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
A lot of word podcastcon

395
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
UK was about this year

396
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,760
And it's definitely not a

397
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,760
A podshow-only program

398
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Believe you me

399
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
But very, very interesting

400
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
And it's also a heavy

401
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Slant towards the music scene

402
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,760
Which of course is always very interesting in the UK

403
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
What do we have more UK?

404
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,760
It's coming again

405
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Podfest returns to the purple turtle in Camden, London

406
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,760
Presented by Gojang Podfest Association

407
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
We advise you as bonus.com

408
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
And we're just starting it

409
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
Another great knowledge of live entertainments

410
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,760
Featuring performances by Seren Co.

411
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Superkicks

412
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Union street runners

413
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,760
And Curve slider

414
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
That's Wednesday, 29 November

415
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
The Purple Turtle in Camden

416
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,760
Bringing you the best in live entertainment

417
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,760
It's Podfest

418
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,760
More details at www. Podfest.co.uk

419
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,760
And I've been assured that

420
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,760
The evening's festivities will be recorded

421
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,760
And we'll be put up on BT Podshow.com as well

422
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,760
Hey, a lot of feedback about two things

423
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,760
First of all about Twit, Leo Leport

424
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,760
And everyone has told me the name of the journalist

425
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,760
And I keep forgetting his name

426
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Hold on, this is what Gmail is good for

427
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,760
I just search for Twit

428
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,760
Just search for Twit

429
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,760
And up pops, will Harris

430
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
There you go

431
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
Will Harris is his name

432
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,760
Okay

433
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
So a comment about that

434
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Yeah, I've had email with Leo

435
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,760
And I'm going to be

436
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,760
Not, I guess they taped Sundays

437
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
They do a call in

438
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,760
So not this coming Sunday, but the Sunday after that

439
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,760
I'm really trying to figure out this

440
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Patricia and I have a very challenging schedule

441
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,760
For the next couple of weeks

442
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Of course she's doing that

443
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,760
Dancing with the stars

444
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
So it's going to be

445
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,760
And I got to come back to San Francisco

446
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,760
So we're just trying to fit everything in

447
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
But tomorrow I leave and I go home

448
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,760
Which is great because I think I'm really able to accomplish

449
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,760
An incredible amount in one week

450
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,760
And then go back and then come back like a week

451
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
Or eight days later

452
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
I actually feel pretty good about that

453
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,760
I mean, the flying part is kind of gnarly

454
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
But otherwise

455
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,760
And the other thing

456
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Oh man, I had no idea that I would get so much response

457
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
About the Chris Moiles thing that I let you hear

458
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
From BBC Radio 1 on Wednesday

459
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,760
Some interesting comments coming in

460
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,760
I had a mission of uncorking uscots

461
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
I heard you talking on 5 or 2

462
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
About the fact that I anchor Chris Moiles

463
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
And the tip you've played

464
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,760
I suspect that Chris knows full well

465
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,760
What a podcast is

466
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,760
And he doesn't see his future there

467
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
So what's with this?

468
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,760
I think it lay my job

469
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,760
But after all ridicule on the whole thing

470
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,760
And gently turn this way

471
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,760
These liveers from following this sort of thing up

472
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
No more than that, expect from him

473
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
That's the best he can manage

474
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,760
You're probably better off in the morning

475
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
Listening to Terry Logan

476
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
If you want a bit more informed in television

477
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
Wims you in comment

478
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,760
I've got one ready at the end

479
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,760
But you already knew that anyway

480
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
I for now

481
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Yeah, I listened to Sir Terry

482
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
And every morning we listen to Sir Terry

483
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
Logan on radio 2

484
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,760
I haven't listened to Chris Moiles enough

485
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
To really have been able to form an opinion on his program

486
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,760
But what I have heard is that he does tow the line

487
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,760
I think he's kind of

488
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Hmm

489
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
He's doing a bit of a shock-jock thing

490
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,760
Yeah, is my general feeling

491
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
From the times that I've listened

492
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
The only thing I ever thought was really great

493
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
That I love was the date diversion line

494
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
I think that's an awesome, awesome idea

495
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
I don't know if it's a Chris Moiles original

496
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,760
But you know, just to be very, very clear

497
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
I don't give a shit about the guy

498
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760
You know what he says or it doesn't say

499
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,760
I'm just hoping he picks up what we're talking about

500
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,760
And broadcasts it again to his audience of millions

501
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,760
Come on, let's be honest about it

502
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
Oh, what I'm interested in is going to write the last message

503
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,760
You can ignore that because this is the real message

504
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,760
And that's through for your might case

505
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
He's an absolute parcel

506
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
All sort of the highest order

507
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,760
What an arrogant runger

508
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
And it's got nothing to do with like

509
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
Not knowing who you are or what podcasts are

510
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
He talks to people like that all the time

511
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,760
And this is the kind of shit that

512
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
That teenagers in this country listen to

513
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
And expect that's the way to go on with people

514
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
That's the way to go on and treat people of it

515
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
Different religions are different

516
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
There

517
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,760
Different ethnicity

518
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,760
It's a

519
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Second build this morning

520
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,760
You really have what an absolute idiot

521
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,760
They say they may say hello this idiot

522
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
To go on the radio and preach to the masses

523
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,760
These are the big listener following us

524
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
It's no doubt about it

525
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
He has a very big listener following

526
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,760
There are only seconds there to tell you

527
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,760
What a what a what a what an absolute one

528
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,760
He hasn't got the same style yet

529
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
Adults about anything

530
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,760
And I just urge anybody

531
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
To listen to this podcast

532
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
It's not really your source

533
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
It's not really your source

534
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
There's infinitely better content out there

535
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
Infirmantly

536
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,760
And just turn on the radio

537
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
To listen to tell you open

538
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,760
Just because he's not fast enough

539
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Doesn't mean he's not good

540
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,760
It's a good clean form

541
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,760
Bit of a loss

542
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,760
People who know how to

543
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,760
I don't even know what I want to say

544
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,760
Now he's got me so bloody runger between the people

545
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
What a fossa

546
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
They cheers me at anywhere

547
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Bye

548
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
Decaf maybe next time my friend

549
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,760
Oh, gotten into some social political issues there

550
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,760
This is what what's the Chris Moiles is destroying teenagers in the UK

551
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,760
I'm glad you haven't investigated the podshow network too deeply yet

552
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,760
I think we you know, I'm very happy with the BBC program

553
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
It costs me 131 pounds a year

554
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,760
It's it is truly

555
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
User supported

556
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,760
So people who have a television or radio have to pay for it

557
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,760
You pay for a license and that pays for the for the content

558
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
I like what we're getting

559
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,760
I think it's fantastic

560
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
I think should do more of that high-brow stuff

561
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Leave all the low-brow stuff to us

562
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
Come on mate, we should have Chris Moiles

563
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,760
Let's do it trade

564
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
Okay

565
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
Why not

566
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,760
We'll take Chris Moiles

567
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,760
And we'll give you

568
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,760
Mark Hunter

569
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Tim's safe

570
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
We've got what I was looking for

571
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
Hi

572
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
We've got M

573
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
A BBC just to follow on from that

574
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
We've also got regional BBC stations

575
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,760
So you get BBC North

576
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
We see North West

577
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
We see Midlands

578
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Expect

579
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
So the BBC provide regional services

580
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,760
Well

581
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
Ask for Chris Moiles

582
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
These are Aaron Wangar

583
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
There you go

584
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,760
As far as I'm concerned

585
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
I wouldn't listen

586
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
He's podcasting

587
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
It's the last thing in the radio

588
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
Or in the

589
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
In the

590
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
What a pretty spicy young man

591
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
I am

592
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
Get it

593
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
I am matey

594
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
You are a very feisty young man

595
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
I'm enjoying it very much

596
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
Yeah

597
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
I didn't do a really good job of explaining

598
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,760
Exactly how the BBC works

599
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
I realize that

600
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
It's it's complicated

601
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
But yeah

602
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
There are lots of regional stations as well

603
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,760
It is very networking

604
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Like

605
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
But I guess the whole point is

606
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,760
It's user

607
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
Supported

608
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,760
I'm sure the government

609
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
Of course the government kicks in as well

610
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
But it's basically paid from taxes

611
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
Whether direct taxes or indirect taxes

612
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
I love it

613
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
I think it's really good

614
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
I think it's a good thing

615
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
I'm saying the cause

616
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,760
I'm just going to point to your

617
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,760
Chris Moiles comments

618
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,760
Chris Moiles

619
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
I ask you how to speak

620
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
Chris Moiles

621
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
You know in the day

622
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,760
It's not a big thing

623
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
The Internet is in 2004

624
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
I think I would say

625
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
That's what the Internet is

626
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
It's going to be more

627
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
It's the latest in the

628
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
Human

629
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Characters

630
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Chris Moiles is

631
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
How to speak

632
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
He would also like to be called

633
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
This radio

634
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
That radio

635
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,760
Stop

636
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,760
You should know

637
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
Whether it's anybody

638
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,260
It's a low understanding

639
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,760
That

640
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,760
That radio

641
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,760
So

642
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
So

643
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
It's a good performed

644
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,920
This is this

645
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:42,920
What was the strong language, now you've got the interest in?

646
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,920
Okay, he's abusive. See, I told you there was like a shock-jock thing that was going on there with him.

647
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,920
If you have to formally apologize to Elton John, you really did some fucking wrong.

648
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:19,920
I think you've had to use of course one of this, and you realize the way it impacts the perceived effect and the way you're moving on.

649
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:27,920
In the end, you tell me that you're an elephant in some brown names. You've said that you just have to mention that there's other products that the same is not available.

650
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,920
So, for example, I'm going to explain that I have to explain that I'm very safe and confused.

651
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,920
So, I can mention that that's five nine, but I will have to mention that there are a few three parts available.

652
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:49,920
That's what I'm talking about.

653
00:24:49,920 --> 00:25:04,920
I love Microsoft.

654
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,920
That's fucked up.

655
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,920
That's really fucked up, man. Do you got to do that shit?

656
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:19,920
No matter what you say, you have to provide a complete opposing view, what a waste of time.

657
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:25,920
Really? What a waste of time you have to do that. That God for podcasting.

658
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:53,920
There you have it. Complete and detailed information.

659
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,920
Oh, on the Chris Moiles courtesy of your David source code friends, the audience.

660
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Found this on pms. Thought it was good for a Friday.

661
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,920
Because I feel the same way sometimes about it has been heard lately.

662
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:38,920
Well, that you do. On the Saturday night, you know I had a withream of you.

663
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:46,920
And I was thinking that you so out of sight despite the fact that you're in my view.

664
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,920
And it's true. One could love you like I do.

665
00:26:51,920 --> 00:27:00,920
So listen when I'm down in here, I think the love you've more than a lizard than me.

666
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Was that you girl? Who was looking so good? When you bought it, I know it's going.

667
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:25,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

668
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,920
You've got everything but a fool. And I never want to do.

669
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,920
I think enough you've more than a lizard than me.

670
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:24,220
it's come out

671
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:48,220
Who's at you girl, and was looking so good, when you put it in a no-gance boy,

672
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:57,220
and that was her girl, and I mean that would you wear your smile when you count your hair and a tear,

673
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:10,220
but you've got everything I've done, and you all I ever want I do, I keep in love with you more than a little bit of it.

674
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:27,220
Now you'd be thinking, if from the UK, no way, they're from Illinois, they are the Jerry's, but of course as they call themselves British Influence Guitar Pop Band.

675
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,220
That's from Chicago, to be exact.

676
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:35,220
I love you more than Elizabeth Hurley on Daily Source Code episode 503.

677
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:42,220
Still gonna check out some more great podcasts, actually new stuff, not even on the podcast, music that we're coming up in just a couple minutes.

678
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,220
After some feedback which pertains to my business.

679
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:53,220
So Adam, it's my turn here from the Golemash podcast, which is hosted on Podgeau.

680
00:29:53,220 --> 00:30:02,220
It doesn't say a few things about the new Podgeau Podgeau Plus and the MB to the latest version of it.

681
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:13,220
First of all, a couple of my listeners to my show are visually impaired and they use an access box system, screen reader,

682
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,220
to act as Podgeau is called Freedom Box.

683
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,220
Now the old Podgeau, you'll work very well with it.

684
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,220
Now the new Podgeau doesn't work very well with it at all.

685
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:29,220
In fact, one of my listeners totally lost my podcast completely because it finds a new Podgeau

686
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:34,220
to be completely unnavigable via Freedom Box access app.

687
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,220
You know, this is a very upsetting to me to hear this.

688
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:44,220
It's interesting, I had lunch with IL, Al Shavit, who now works at Podgeau as well.

689
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:50,220
It's guy who really understands building out big technology, crap.

690
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:57,220
And I said, you know, there's so much stuff that comes through daily source code that pertains to our business.

691
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,220
It said, they should be fucking listening to it.

692
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,220
And I know that the best way to get someone to listen to it is talk about them.

693
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:08,220
But yeah, you know, I remember when version 1.0 came out.

694
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,220
We had a lot of the accessibility issues.

695
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:17,220
And of course, we all vowed that we'd be very careful with our next version.

696
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,220
And guess what, sucks.

697
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,220
Yeah, this is I definitely want to fix that.

698
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:29,220
The problem is I'm pretty sure that in general web 2.0, if you can call it that,

699
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:39,220
it's not very vision impaired friendly with Ajax and cascading style sheets.

700
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,220
You know, and whenever you change something, particularly when you have software,

701
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,220
there's trying to figure out what is happening on the other end.

702
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:52,220
This box reader, whatever you call it, you know, things have to be adjusted and crap.

703
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
I hate it when that happens.

704
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,220
Okay, so we'll definitely put this in because we got to fix that.

705
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:06,220
I know there's a lot of visually impaired listeners of the daily source code and apologize that we've completely fucked that up.

706
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:11,220
It shouldn't be too hard though to fix whatever the main issues are.

707
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:17,220
But I think we're going to have to do is we're going to have to get a specialist in on the case.

708
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,220
So that we can kind of build it more into our foundations.

709
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:26,220
We've started some of that and I all I can do is apologize and promise that we all once again,

710
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,220
I've tried to do much better with that.

711
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,220
By the way, this video box is made by Sarah Carekin.

712
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,220
I can be found at freedombox.info and it was interested.

713
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:42,220
Also, the problems with the, who, what is it?

714
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:49,220
Since the revamp, I've had to be failures to do automatic uploads by a Casplaster, not plenty.

715
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,220
Hopefully, that should be fixed for you.

716
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,220
Actually, we went through that a couple of days ago.

717
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:58,220
We had an actual issue with Casplaster uploading.

718
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,220
But as far as I know, that's all taken care of.

719
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,220
It works for me.

720
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,220
So if it's working for me, then I presume it's working for you.

721
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,220
If it's not by the time you hear this, call me again or email me, let me know.

722
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,220
Or use the podcast or support link at the bottom of any page.

723
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,220
If it was the old version, it would upload perfectly.

724
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,220
This time we try and upload.

725
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,220
And it just fails errors.

726
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,220
The front and center was going on there.

727
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:26,220
Also, when I tried to do the manual upload, it was a complete pig.

728
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,220
To find the actual upload show.

729
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,220
There was an obvious add a show.

730
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,220
And of course, that's not the option they wanted.

731
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,220
And I found it sort of very deep, sort of with the entire domestic control.

732
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,220
But it wasn't, it's not exactly intuitive.

733
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,220
I don't know what your thoughts on there, Adam.

734
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,220
I didn't hear that you had it.

735
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,220
I mean, had it usability tested.

736
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,220
Was that with real users?

737
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:56,220
Or just the pseudo users that you people within Pot Show incorporated.

738
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,220
It's been tested on like outside people.

739
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,220
I said, come and start Adam.

740
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,220
This is my kind of from the show.

741
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,220
I mean, the UK.

742
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,220
I'll just take that.

743
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,220
The last night comment is British humor.

744
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,220
There Mike.

745
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,220
Okay.

746
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,220
Of course, we tested on real users.

747
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:18,220
We did not, by the way, tested on visually impaired users.

748
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:22,220
Now, we probably tested on the same users as that Pew Internet study.

749
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,220
Very interesting.

750
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:30,220
And if you've heard about this, Pew Internet, they basically concluded that since April,

751
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:37,220
when an average of 7% of the American public had heard a podcast or downloaded a podcast,

752
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,220
downloaded a podcast.

753
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,220
Yeah.

754
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:49,220
That is now risen in sort of six months time to 12%.

755
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,220
And this, I love statistics.

756
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,220
I love to argue about it.

757
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,220
Guess what is it amongst the study of 2000 people?

758
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,220
I think it's representative.

759
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,220
I'm no statistician, as you all know.

760
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,220
But I guess it would have to compare versus the numbers that they're looking at because they

761
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,220
are using percentages.

762
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,220
So that's a nice jump.

763
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,220
A couple of other interesting things.

764
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,220
The biggest demographic jump 50 to 65.

765
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,220
I thought that was pretty interesting.

766
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,220
Every category is up.

767
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,220
Every age demographic.

768
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,220
But over 50 seems to have jumped higher.

769
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,220
Which, of course, is completely consistent with everything we keep saying about advertising.

770
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,220
Advertisers always want to go for the young, young demographic.

771
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:35,220
But people with actual money are buying computers and iPods and are tuning into this stuff.

772
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,220
It's not just a young man's game anymore.

773
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,220
But the BBC interpreted the study a little differently.

774
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:50,220
They interpreted the study with the headline podcast numbers show, quote, few hooked.

775
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,220
So they start off with the 12% versus 7% earlier this year.

776
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:02,220
However, in the original study, there was a question actually took the effort here to get the original study.

777
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,220
Take a look at it at pwinternet.org.

778
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,220
And let me see if I can just find this one question.

779
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,220
So the way the question was worded.

780
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:17,220
I don't want to misrepresent this because it's really important with this stuff.

781
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:23,220
So the question was, please tell me if you ever use the internet to do any of the following things.

782
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,220
So this is the actual call out question.

783
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:31,220
Do you ever use the internet to download a podcast so you can listen to it or view it at a later time?

784
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,220
Okay, so that was the 12%.

785
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:39,220
So people are actually downloading podcasts to listen to it or view it at a later time,

786
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:44,220
which means video podcasts are also important.

787
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,220
And then the second part of this question,

788
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:52,220
did you happen to do this yesterday or not?

789
00:36:52,220 --> 00:37:01,220
And only 1% in both cases in the study February to April 2006 and in the August to November study,

790
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:05,220
in both cases only 1% answered yes.

791
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,220
So clearly, lots of work to be done.

792
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:15,220
And that kind of confuses me, well, maybe it's on par with subscriptions.

793
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,220
Maybe this whole subscription thing isn't working all that well,

794
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:27,220
because I can only imagine if 12% I see what's 1% so about if I just did the math on this,

795
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:37,220
a little under, so like 9% of people who have downloaded a podcast are subscribed,

796
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:44,220
whether they're doing a manual subscription, i.e. I'm going to pick it up or whether it's being done for them by technology.

797
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:52,220
That's a little lower than we're seeing. I think we're seeing about a 30 to 35 rate on podshow.com, percent rate.

798
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:56,220
But just kind of interesting that that's what the BBC decided to headline with.

799
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,220
Well, thank you. You pointed out where we have to do some work.

800
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,220
And that's not a problem.

801
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:08,220
It really isn't very, very happy with these results. That's pretty incredible.

802
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:13,220
We've almost doubled the numbers in half a year, so congratulations to everybody.

803
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:18,220
Congratulations to you, listeners, because you're the ones benefiting from all this shit.

804
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,220
Let's see one more thing here.

805
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,220
Hi Adam, it's Neil Ford from the UK. Just calling just been listening to five or two,

806
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:31,220
and just want to add comment to your cast class, cast a blast a bit.

807
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:38,220
And to say, I think that you, whoever at Podshow is responsible for assisting the guys from overcast,

808
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,220
the Mac application, to get that working with the PVA.

809
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,220
I know it's not quite there yet. The version I have doesn't quite support it,

810
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:51,220
but I know it's in the works and obviously I suspect that somebody at Podshow is helping the guys

811
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:56,220
out to make sure it'll work because that functionality is just going to be absolutely fantastic.

812
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,220
Being a Mac user, cast a blast is not an option.

813
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,220
So having a piece of software that is going to work with PVA is fantastic.

814
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:08,220
And everybody involved in that process really means big thank you.

815
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,220
Just want to write that.

816
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,220
And to say as usual, just keep doing what you're doing. Enjoy the show.

817
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,220
And it was great to see you on the Thursday.

818
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,220
Yeah man.

819
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,220
Take care.

820
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,220
Thank you.

821
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,220
Yeah.

822
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,220
In fact, I know that this work has already been completed.

823
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:31,220
Now we have an API on Podshow Plus,

824
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:37,220
where you can use any type of software you can create that speaks a pretty simple language.

825
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,220
I think it's a, think it's straight XMLRPC.

826
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,220
There may be a few couple special bits in there.

827
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,220
But we, that's how cast blasts are actually talks to the system.

828
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,220
And that's how any, any uploader, I guess.

829
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,220
It's funny that you mentioned this and I can't quite find the comment.

830
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:58,220
Com extra blogger also sent me this fantastic comment about how we need an uploader.

831
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:04,220
This is an opportunity for someone to make some money by creating an uploader.

832
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:10,220
Or someone to, to get some notoriety with their programming skills by creating an uploader.

833
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,220
So we've actually made it a completely compatible with Uber Castor.

834
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:19,220
There were some very interesting issues on the Macintosh side that I think Apple actually had to fix.

835
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,220
I'll have to ask Andrew Grummit some of the history of this is a developer.podshow.com.

836
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,220
And one of my resolutions for the coming years that we pay more attention to the developer community.

837
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:32,220
Who have been extremely helpful and have gotten a lot of cool things into podshow plus.

838
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:37,220
But we really haven't done much to support it yet that, you know, you can really say, wow, look at what we did.

839
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:44,220
We've been doing our best kind of with with a little bit of extra time that we do have.

840
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:50,220
So there was something about the way the Mac handle XMLRPC calls that had to be changed.

841
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,220
I believe that was changed with Apple.

842
00:40:53,220 --> 00:41:00,220
I have seen the actual, you know, like a hello and response from Uber Castor into podshow plus.

843
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,220
And I think those guys are just firming up their next release and it should be in there.

844
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:09,220
And I can't wait because that will finally give Mac users a fantastic way to upload your show and your show notes.

845
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,220
Everything is all done in one go right into your feed.

846
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,220
So that'll be exciting.

847
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,220
But again, you know, you can create any type of uploader.

848
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,220
The API is exposed open.

849
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,220
It's commonly known.

850
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,220
It works with the validator, all that stuff that you need.

851
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,220
And you're more than welcome to to create something.

852
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:31,220
And maybe you have some kind of fantastic business proposal for us regarding that.

853
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,220
Very open to listening to all of that.

854
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,220
You're doing everybody.

855
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,220
It's Marcus couch from the scene scene and podshow music rewind.

856
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,220
Happy food bar Friday, everybody.

857
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,220
Hope everyone in the US had a great Thanksgiving.

858
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,220
I know you're probably out doing a little bit of shopping right now.

859
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,220
So I'm going to give you a real rocker here on Fubar.

860
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,220
Adam, I know you're anxious to get back to the round corner towels.

861
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,220
So here's a song just for you.

862
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,220
This band is called Revery.

863
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,220
They're from Virginia Beach, Virginia.

864
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,220
They've been played on both rewind and the scene scene.

865
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,220
I know you're going to enjoy it.

866
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,220
This one's for you.

867
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,220
It's Pop Star Wedding.

868
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,220
Rock out of Pop Star Wedding.

869
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,220
And I'm sitting in the blues.

870
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,220
I don't need food.

871
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,220
And we're getting into the shoe.

872
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,220
I won't take no credit or a dollar from you.

873
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,220
Don't you feel me?

874
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,220
I got nothing to lose.

875
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,220
There's no way to move.

876
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,220
There's got to feel it.

877
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,220
I got stuck in the snow.

878
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,220
I'll see it all the time.

879
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:40,220
I don't think that I can take it all my life.

880
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,220
I don't need to see you.

881
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,220
I got to feel it.

882
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,220
I got to see it all my life.

883
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:50,220
Seems like I got to hold all the now.

884
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:55,220
So if you're trying to take me down, you can't forget it now.

885
00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:03,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

886
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,220
I'll wait for the day to score.

887
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

888
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,220
I'll wait for the day to score.

889
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

890
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

891
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

892
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

893
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

894
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

895
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

896
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

897
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

898
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

899
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,220
I'll make a heart run, honey, honey.

900
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

901
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

902
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

903
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

904
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

905
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

906
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

907
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

908
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

909
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:45,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

910
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

911
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,220
I've got to see this.

912
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,220
I'll make a heart run, honey.

913
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,220
And I go chill out and I'll roll up

914
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,220
Seems like I got over now

915
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:00,220
So if you're trying to take me

916
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,220
Now you can't forget it now

917
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:29,220
I hit it all the time

918
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:46,160
I wasn't brave enough to take it all

919
00:44:46,160 --> 00:45:09,480
The rubbery pop star wedding, thank you very much Marcus Couch from the so-called

920
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:16,480
reaction on the punch you're about here.

921
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:26,480
That's what I'm talking about.

922
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,040
Hi, this is Ed Ovet, host of the Ed's Mix bag podcast, stopping by the daily source code to

923
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:38,200
wish Adam and all of his listeners a very happy holiday season and a very happy and healthy

924
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:43,200
new year for 2007.

925
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,200
That's so nice, Ed.

926
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,200
Thank you very much, man.

927
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,200
That's right.

928
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,200
We're wrapping up a year as we wrap up a week.

929
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,200
What day is it today?

930
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,200
It's Friday.

931
00:45:53,200 --> 00:46:00,200
One day Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, full of Friday, Adam's final fun on the Wii.

932
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,520
Well, of course, as we bring yet another year to an end, it's been quite an interesting

933
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,520
one for me.

934
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:13,240
I've had some emotional ups and downs, particularly with the passing of my mom.

935
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,880
So as we do here in America, as when we hit Thanksgiving, you know, and we did this last night,

936
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,560
I was wondering if it would be different from any other Thanksgiving that I've had with my

937
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,560
family.

938
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,560
But people do kind of say, hey, you know, here's the shit I'm thankful for.

939
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,560
And it's nice.

940
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:34,400
And the only thing I can really think of that I'm thankful for is the health of my wife and

941
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,400
daughter.

942
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:42,520
Not 100%, all things considered, you know, they're healthy.

943
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:46,480
And maybe I'm just getting them to become a really old fucking fart.

944
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,720
But that seems to be the most important thing to me.

945
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,440
In fact, yesterday, the last night, I thought I got back from from the feast I'm sitting

946
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,720
on the couch and, you know, just digging around, looking at stuff and I thought, if I

947
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,040
didn't go out and buy a toy for myself, something I really really wanted, it didn't

948
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,040
matter what it costs.

949
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,040
What would it be?

950
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,440
And I just couldn't think of anything.

951
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,440
I just wasn't interested.

952
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,840
I'm completely content.

953
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:10,200
I'm completely happy, particularly because those two are healthy.

954
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:20,160
And that's my final lot of the week.

955
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,320
Yeah, speaking of which, I have to get the lighter to sign off the show.

956
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,320
Hey, everybody.

957
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,320
Thank you very much for listening.

958
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,680
I'll be back in the curry cottage starting Monday.

959
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,360
I'll be there for a week, and then I'll be back here at the condo in San Francisco.

960
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,640
If you did celebrate the holidays, I hope it was a great one.

961
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,600
If you're in the UK, pocket man, it's weekend and joy.

962
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:59,520
