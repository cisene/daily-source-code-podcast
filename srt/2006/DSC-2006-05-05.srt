00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I think it turns me on.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Because you want to wish the killer hisfather?

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Maybe I am a little fucking crazy.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's right, maybe Jerry is a little nice.

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But this isn't about me, but i'm a little cool cool.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Pop声 coming from around.

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hide滿 it, take the knock to run!

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm surround in myself a negative TV,

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Memes it sounded like i'll never breath,

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and I'm drowning.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,260
I don't want to leave, I hate work, give a cat shot, it was the G.

39
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,960
This makes work, give a time for my family, my soul's hurt, in the same mind as the G.

40
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,240
That's what's hurt, it's not what it didness, in the world only God can fill me up,

41
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,200
what is love, but the temptation is strong, I need to pray, if you want to change the path you're on,

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,040
just say, I need to wake up, I forgot what's important now, wake up, come to money, ain't never day,

43
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,480
wake up, all my dues bring all day now, wake up, I gotta do it for my family, wake up,

44
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:03,040
all my God was important now, wake up, I'm a loser, I'll send it in, wake up, got the one that's in there, wake up,

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:13,640
I gotta give my life together now, I love to go around, all I see are snakes, and there's that still hate, cheap,

46
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:20,640
I know it, everybody knows it, I see their face, and there's absolutely no good,

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,640
because they lie still hate, cheap, I know it, everybody knows it,

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:34,640
God, humbly, make me a servant, I ask for mercy, I don't deserve it, I can spot some slaves too,

49
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:42,640
I'll prefer it, it catches my eye, though, I need to change, I'm always chasing, and at my neck, people will kill for,

50
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,640
I don't have money, there's never enough of, I don't have money, there's nothing but misery,

51
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,640
I don't have money, there's nothing but emptiness, in the world only God can fill me up,

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,640
don't put his love, the temptation just strong, I need to pray, if you want to change the path you're going,

53
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:06,640
there's a saying, I need to wake up, I forgot what's important now, wake up, come to money, ain't never day,

54
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,640
there you go, all are doing the trick on me now, wake up, I got to do it for my family,

55
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,640
here you go, I forgot what's important now, I'm losing my sanity, here you go,

56
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,640
God for one, I can say it made me wake up, I got to give my eyes together now,

57
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,640
I just got a new whip, I need another one, I just got a new crit, I need a break of one, I just got a new child,

58
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,640
I need a better one, I just got tangy, already spent, do you want what I got to do,

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:44,640
the game, we got to do it, he's on the game, there's a bovine marching around the street,

60
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,640
he's on the same song, and this is a piece of venery, and some of the TV is unbelievable emptiness.

61
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,640
The game Dobarles only God can fill me up, pour this love,

62
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,640
the temptation just strong, I need to pray, if you want to change the path you're going, there's a saying,

63
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,640
wake up, I forgot what's important now, I'm woke up, crush money, ain't never day,

64
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:12,640
I got to do it for my family We go, I forgot what's important now

65
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,640
I got to go, I'm a little sad, we go, got to go, I'm gonna say it

66
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,640
There we go, I got to go, I got to go, I got to go

67
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,640
What's again we made at friends?

68
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,640
It's Friday.

69
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,640
Cinco de Mayo.

70
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
No less.

71
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,640
Coming to you from the affluent suburb.

72
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,640
I'm sorry, you'll put it in the UK on another beautiful, beautiful spring day

73
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,640
I got to almost call it a summer day.

74
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,640
Eminending from the furry cottage, it should be a short code

75
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,640
With Michael Gomez wake up, the perfect song for me this morning

76
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,640
I had one of those days where you know where you wake up

77
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,640
And it just seems like nothing's exactly right

78
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,640
I just was irritated, completely irritated about life and everything

79
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,640
I thought that was stupid, why should I be irritated about life?

80
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,640
The fact that I woke up is it's good enough right there

81
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,640
Yeah, okay, we're at the end of the week

82
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,640
And got some stuff to go over with you

83
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
As I was getting ready for the show today

84
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,640
And we're doing a little differently, I'm actually drinking a coke today instead of a scentsail

85
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,640
We never have soft drinks in the house

86
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,640
Or rarely ever have soft drinks but Patricia came up with lunch while I was prepping

87
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,640
God, let me tell you

88
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,640
I went through two almost three hours of just going through my email today

89
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,640
I hate it, I hate, I hate, I hate email

90
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
I know we have to live with it, but you know it's like

91
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,640
There's business stuff, there's opportunities

92
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,640
And there's all these different comments and songs and stuff

93
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,640
And I really, I tried to read it all but more importantly, I tried to listen to everything

94
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,640
And it just takes so much time out of my day

95
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,640
I enjoy doing it, I really do

96
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,640
But you know, what are we at now?

97
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
We're at one o'clock already

98
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,640
And I sat down to start my email

99
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,640
And prep the showcase, basically how I start prepping the show

100
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,640
I keep track of stuff during the day

101
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,640
And so I have a running list of stuff

102
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,640
And then the next morning I just, let me just check and see if anything came in overnight

103
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,640
And it was astronomical last night for some reason

104
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,640
And actually almost none of the promos and stuff that came in

105
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,640
I felt like playing it, either way too long or not entertaining

106
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Or just didn't do it before we maybe

107
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,640
It's my mood, I don't know what it is

108
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
So very little promos today

109
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,640
So I know coffee because Patricia said she brought up my one

110
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,640
She did make a great lunch for me

111
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,640
An omelet with a little bit of crack pepper

112
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,640
In a sandwich

113
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
And she said okay because

114
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Because you need it today, you can have a coke

115
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,640
And so I'm downstairs in the kitchen

116
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,640
And into the mailbox pops a brochure of flyer

117
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Yeah, I fold it over flyer

118
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,640
This is something I could easily send to the tonight show

119
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,640
It's from the Clandon Park Garden Center

120
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,640
And coffee shop, which of course if you're going to go to the garden center

121
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,640
Why not go to the coffee shop

122
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,640
It would make a lot more sense if this was an Amsterdam actually

123
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,640
But on the back of it and this is maybe even something

124
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,640
For the Yanks versus the Brits

125
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,640
But just because I just picked it up

126
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Just moments ago

127
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,640
Okay, so on the back they have a watering special

128
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,640
And they have this eight, you know what

129
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,640
How many points does this star have here

130
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,640
A nine-pointed red star right in the middle of the brochure

131
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
And it says limited stocks

132
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
A water butt pump

133
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Yeah, water butt

134
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,640
B U T T water butt pump

135
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,640
High power pump connects to your normal hose pipe

136
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,640
And I like now there's something the Yanks and the Brits

137
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Definitely disagree on when we talk about the use of the word but what the heck is a butt

138
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,640
In the UK then

139
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,640
You know and I could totally see Jayl and I'm looking at this going

140
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Oh, high power pump connects to your normal hose pipe

141
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
A water butt pump

142
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
Okay

143
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,640
Thought you'd be interested in that

144
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,640
Wow, what a lot of response we got to the

145
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,640
To the show where we had the lovely lady Patricia on

146
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,640
And was she ringing me about second life

147
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,640
And you know what actually I do understand

148
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,640
I want a little headphone ear there

149
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,640
I have one earring in my left ear

150
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,640
And I've been wearing headphones so much

151
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
You know, actually not that much lately with flying

152
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,640
But with flying and just doing the source code

153
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
That the

154
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
It's starting to get inflamed

155
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,640
I can totally understand where conversations

156
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,640
Regarding what goes on in second life

157
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Are very boring to people who are not on second life

158
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,640
And I mean we're totally I am totally excluding you from the conversation

159
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
So I'm not going to do that anymore

160
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,640
In fact, I've actually considered doing a separate second life podcast

161
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
But you know

162
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Where am I going to find the time of the day to do that

163
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
But there is some validity to what's going on there

164
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,640
I was watching the on Hollywood conference via stream yesterday

165
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,640
And I must have heard in 10 minutes

166
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,640
I must have heard someone mention second life at least once a minute

167
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,640
So there is definitely something to it

168
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
And it's not you know

169
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,640
I think that I'll just for go the conversation about it

170
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,640
But there is something about guys like me who check stuff like that

171
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
Adam Russell Hansen from the Dark Matters podcast here

172
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
Or in second life Russell Hansen

173
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Yes, I got my real name in second life as well

174
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,640
I had you talking to Patricia yesterday

175
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
And me and talk about deja vu

176
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,640
I was wondering if you'd been listening in a conversation between me and my wife

177
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,640
My computer time and her attitude to it have been the biggest discussion point of our marriage

178
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Okay, now I haven't had that problem, okay Russell

179
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,640
You know that but there's whole concept of playing games

180
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,640
Yeah, that's been a hot topic as you might have heard two shows ago

181
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
What I see is possibilities and opportunities

182
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,640
She sees this wasting time away from the family

183
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,640
But at the same time she fails to see all of the IT things she accepts as part of her daily life

184
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Without thinking about it

185
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,640
Which came from the people like you and I exploring the potential of what may be

186
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Playing your bills without taking a trip to someone's place of business

187
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,640
Sharing emails and digital photos with her sister in the UK

188
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,640
A voice-over IP, cheap phone calls

189
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Yeah, that's all fine right everybody loves that stuff

190
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,640
And who who was working on that for years right exactly

191
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,640
I'm back in the old days from finger me

192
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,640
I used to tell the television hey man people are fingering me

193
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,640
She said what what are you doing on that computer

194
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,640
Those are the old unix days when you could provide your dot plan information through a finger command

195
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,640
Asons of other things it started out as someone tinkering with an idea

196
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,640
Exactly now an arguable point but what I consider a big misconception

197
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,640
Second life is not a game. I've been playing computer games for 25 years

198
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,640
An online multiplayer games for about eight years

199
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,640
Oh man do you remember moves and mugs you remember that?

200
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,640
That was oh it was actually that was kind of the same thing wasn't it?

201
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,640
I don't know if anyone was at college university in the in the mid 90s

202
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,640
It was big man you it was all text based and people would sit on it for hours

203
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,640
And you know you basically use your imagination

204
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,640
Very much like reading a book an interactive screenplay actually

205
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,640
I can tell you second life is as much a game as windows or macOS is a game

206
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,640
You can play games in second life show

207
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,640
But it's much more than that

208
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,640
It's a platform for a new way of creating content and interacting with the online community

209
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,640
What I can do is only limited by two things people's imaginations in the state of the technology

210
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,640
Virtual worlds I see at the level of technology of MS-5 or maybe in the online world

211
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,640
Around the time when links tell that nifty p where the guy prior to HTML really

212
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Taking over remember it well

213
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,640
We've been given a be a band's technology and doing our best with what's there in this such

214
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,640
It looks simplistic and clunky to those account grasp the potential

215
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,640
And it's not intuitive enough yet to appeal to the masses

216
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,640
But that's just a matter of time

217
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,640
If we ever get over the hurdles of bandwidth given two or three years

218
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,640
Virtual worlds are going to grow enormously as preferred medium to render act with the online world

219
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Just listen to that online world

220
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,640
It's already a phrase being used to talk about the internet

221
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,640
But what is today we're talking about text and titty graphics

222
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,640
You know it's interesting. We don't even realize any more than in our common day speech

223
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,640
We go to a website and in fact I remember when people started saying that

224
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,640
And it was very interesting at the time

225
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,640
I went there. I went to what were we doing the planet rebook dot com yeah

226
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
I went to planet rebook

227
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:38,640
That was it almost by the definition of the description of virtual work in coming

228
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,640
Hey guys, if you're flying over here you're missing the airfield

229
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,640
Because that was really you know going to planet rebook going to bud what going somewhere

230
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,640
We go to a website. Isn't that interesting where you're not really going anywhere

231
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,640
It's already crept into our into our vocabulary

232
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,640
The paradigm is about to be expanded to something which more closely resembles what we actually see in our real life

233
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Meaning it should be more user friendly and intuitive to the non-IT literate

234
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Which is always limiting factor to how much of the community accepts technology

235
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:15,640
It has to be easy fifth use for someone who has nine clue about computers something just hit me when you were saying that

236
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Remember was it Microsoft Bob was that it when Microsoft tried to create a like a virtual environment

237
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,640
Instead of the traditional desktop

238
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Maybe we should be looking at it that way

239
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,640
That was it was a huge failure by the way

240
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
It was so clunky and so dumb

241
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:45,640
But there's I'm with your man. I'm with you. I'm right there with you on the you know that it's that it's no different from macOS or windows or any other type of environment

242
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,640
Were you manage information?

243
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,640
Finally regarding the matter of wasting time of on the computer

244
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Obviously some people can take this to extremes

245
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,640
But I'm also that any work or extra curricular activity that currently exists

246
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
Personally

247
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:05,640
I don't drink. Don't go to the pub or parties with mates. That's why you're right. Why would your wife as pissed off dude?

248
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,640
She got to live it up a little bit.

249
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Take competitive sports. I'm at home when I'm not awake. How can this be a bad thing?

250
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,640
I'm there when needed. My kids can come and see me whenever they like. My wife knows what I'm doing.

251
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
I'm spending

252
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Oh really

253
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Very little money compared to activities away from home

254
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,640
But still I spend too much time on the computer or so I'm told

255
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,640
Thank you very much. Sometimes I do spend too much time on the computer

256
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,640
Well, and my other hobbies, throwing boom rings, flying radio control helicopter's

257
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,640
Making interest here and of course my astronomy and podcasting

258
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,640
But that still seems better than spending too much time at the pub

259
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,640
And no matter how many times I've tried to get it to come join me in my preferred pastimes

260
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,640
She still breathes and attempts to include her

261
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Okay, one last big comment. Please stop saying that every person in second life

262
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
Is having six?

263
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Oh please.

264
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
That's one of no interest in that side of it.

265
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
And I'm not the only one that I know of.

266
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,640
Sure it's a big part of it and those who are interested

267
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,640
But as much as I'm interested in real life, second life holds no appeal to me in that area

268
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,640
Talk about all you like but don't throw all of us into the same mold

269
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,640
It's not helping us promote second life to others as a serious way of communicating

270
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,640
with the community and doing business when people come back and say, but I don't carry

271
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
Say it.

272
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,640
Okay.

273
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
That's it from me.

274
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
Yeah.

275
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
I think that more of those golden tickets.

276
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
Oh yeah.

277
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Yeah.

278
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,640
You've still got plenty, but I haven't seen one in any more

279
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
Downloads yet.

280
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,640
So get cracking and get them out there.

281
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
Anyway, bye for now.

282
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Alright, buddy. Thank you very much.

283
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
Wise words from Down Under.

284
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,640
Gotta agree with you completely.

285
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,640
It's just not about playing.

286
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,640
This is a new wave communicating.

287
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,640
That's all I'm identifying and you're right, man.

288
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,640
You can call it playing at the computer, but I've been doing this all my life

289
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,640
Since the second year, my wife and I were married 18 years now.

290
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,640
I've been tinkering around and it's so funny.

291
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,640
You say that I said, look, isn't this amazing?

292
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,640
Look, I can type in FTP and then a file comes in and look.

293
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Hold on. Hold on. Just wait. It's downloading.

294
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Don't move. Hold on. It's coming.

295
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Oh, there it is. Look. It's a little red ball.

296
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,640
And then we move to the web and every single step.

297
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,640
What was the member I see queue? I see queue.

298
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,640
That was the predecessor to all real instant message clients.

299
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,640
I think this is just another step.

300
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
Alright, moving on.

301
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
We've been talking this past week.

302
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
And I think, by the way, that we're going to get a best of Charlie.

303
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,640
We're going to have some other notes here.

304
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,640
Patricia was looking for something in my office and I always tell her,

305
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,640
please, don't do that because now the note that I had is of course gone.

306
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,640
I asked just lovely.

307
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,640
This is me off. Okay.

308
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,640
I've been talking about silent birth.

309
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:59,640
The all in relation to Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise and Scientology.

310
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,640
And Mark Dand said, Adam, I enjoyed the show.

311
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,640
One of the reasons because of the clean way of you look at things and that you listen

312
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,640
with a smile even to those who criticize the show.

313
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Well, of course.

314
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
My comments on the silent birth stuff.

315
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Hypnosis stuff.

316
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
What was said is true.

317
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,640
What is said while not less or not or less conscious gets recorded.

318
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,640
The important bit is one can become the adverse effect of these recordings.

319
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Good, better and different.

320
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,640
Now, what was said about intentionally putting in good commands is a bad thing because

321
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
let's look at it.

322
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,640
What that amounts to and what hypnosis does is make one into an automation

323
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
to a greater or lesser degree.

324
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,640
I don't understand that sense.

325
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Good, better and different.

326
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
The words or concepts go in.

327
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,640
Since, say, one is being programmed with one's permission or not.

328
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,640
One is being programmed.

329
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,640
A programmed effect on the unconscious mind in Scientology.

330
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,640
One does things to become more cause and less effect.

331
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Mark, I think you've just hypnotized me with your completely in intelligible message.

332
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Yeah, but I kind of understand where you're coming from.

333
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,640
And I was thinking, I would really like to talk more to people who understand about mind control or mind programming.

334
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,640
We've done a pretty good job with this Senseo project.

335
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,640
You know, wherever I go now, whenever there's a burp in the room on the TV.

336
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,640
Man, if I was in the movie theater, it happened, someone would probably say Senseo.

337
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,640
Certainly, if I knew I was in the room.

338
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Is it actually possible to hypnotize someone through a podcast?

339
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,640
I mean, there's gotta be some hypnotist out there who is listening to the show.

340
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,640
And I mean, consider that most people listening to this with ear buds jam deep into their ear.

341
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
I really like to experiment with that.

342
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,640
And with your permission, of course, listeners to the Charlie.

343
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Let's see if we can do some.

344
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,640
The Senseo thing is definitely a programming, but how far can we take it?

345
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,640
This is kind of a Yang's versus the Brits thing.

346
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:02,640
Actually, this was a comment on show number 377 from a UK listener and a fan.

347
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,640
Adam Curry versus the ordinary bloke.

348
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,640
And this is an audio bit just waiting to happen.

349
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,640
AC wakes up at 6 a.m. with a lovely Patricia.

350
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,640
Heads downstairs for a double Senseo in the curry cottage.

351
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,640
Ordinary bloke wakes up with a screaming child at 6 a.m.

352
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,640
And falls downstairs for a cup of instant coffee in a terrace in some northern UK town.

353
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,640
AC turns on his G5 Apple Mac on 20-meg broadband super duper speed.

354
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,640
As the satellite hovers above the lovely affluent town of Guilford in Surrey.

355
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,640
The ordinary bloke turns on his Dell PC piece of crap Microsoft thing.

356
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:42,640
He has the dial-up modem connects at 56 kbps as the rain falls down in the, in the, in the, what?

357
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,640
In the arf you learnt to podcast town in England.

358
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,640
I don't know what that is.

359
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,640
AC begins to podcast to the world from the curry cottage with talk of his car.

360
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,640
A Jaguar soon to be running on biodiesel and saving the world.

361
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Whilst the lovely Patricia makes AC a breakfast of scrambled eggs and smoke salmon with pepper on top.

362
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Ordinary bloke begins to grueling one hour commute to work to Manchester on,

363
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,640
unleaded in a 10 year old Audi A6 soon to run out of unleaded fuel and destroying the world.

364
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,640
Whilst the nagging wife chucks the pack lunch OB for got into the pin.

365
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
AC burps a sincere burp.

366
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,640
As NGB, CSB and Roger Smalls state that they have recently quit their day job and are meeting up

367
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,640
with AC in the curry condo and San Fran.

368
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,640
Ordinary blokes.

369
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
Well, he farts an instant coffee canco at the boss.

370
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,640
The secretary and the phone in sick bloke states that they, that they won the lottery the weekend.

371
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,640
And are meeting up with AC in the curry condo and San Francisco.

372
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,640
AC after podcasting the serious and iTunes and blogging and flickering some picks.

373
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,640
AC joins his second life and enters the badass pleasure rooms in the curry castle while smoking a spliff.

374
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,640
The ordinary bloke, after working all day without a break and receiving C.C.s of emails,

375
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
you will never read.

376
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,640
Ordinary bloke joins his second life in the cardboard box of the I can't afford a real home

377
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,640
never mind a virtual home in the land of 56 KBPS.

378
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,640
For AC after flying around all afternoon, the glorious sky of Surries UK and the D.S.C.

379
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,640
lands on a landing strip of Brazilian qualities.

380
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,640
For the ordinary, ordinary bloke, after messing all afternoon in the dull and cloudy atmosphere

381
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,640
in the office of greater Manchester UK, the ordinary bloke bumps into an old stripper of press-cut qualities.

382
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,640
That's a very UK joke there.

383
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,640
AC and OB take a day off and head to Amsterdam and bump into each other in a cafe.

384
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,640
AC offers OBSN sale, spliffy trippy smoke and OBS offers AC a logger.

385
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,640
Conclusion, AC and OB are both happy and both enjoy the experience.

386
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,640
AC gives OBSG mail address to keep in touch and OB replies but ends up in the junk mail filter of the AC world.

387
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Man, I wish my wife my life was that.

388
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:57,640
I should really jot down everything that happens, but it's much more like,

389
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,640
I'm just, excuse me.

390
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,640
It's much more like I'm just seem to have never ending supply of email.

391
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,640
Oh boy, a way to fix that, please, definitely a way to fix that.

392
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,640
Let's see how we do it on time.

393
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,640
Man, I already blasted through 20 minutes of just talking about crap.

394
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Everyone was talking online about that Stephen Colbert, a speech that he gave at the White House press core dinner.

395
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,640
And so I took some time to download. It was on a bit torrent, which still took forever.

396
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,640
Yeah, maybe saving bandwidth somewhere, but you've got this application open running all the time.

397
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,640
Your computer starts to slow down.

398
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
I don't think we're quite ready.

399
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,640
Just that was not a big bit torrent experience for me.

400
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,640
But I'm really so much, you know, praise for.

401
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,640
Now Stephen Colbert does a show for those of you who don't know in the States,

402
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,640
right after John Stewart's Daily Show and it's a very,

403
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,640
well, it's just like more or less like the Daily Show.

404
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,640
It's, you know, it's a fun look at politics and world news.

405
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,640
And I didn't get it.

406
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
I didn't think it was funny.

407
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,640
I thought, you know, all of us one liners were like kind of like chuckle one liners.

408
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,640
And really, it kind of appalled me to see, you know, here's the world's press sitting there,

409
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,640
making jokes about the low polls, about Dick Cheney.

410
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,640
But really, it's, it's appalling.

411
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,640
You know, I expect so much more from a press core and even Stephen Colbert, you know,

412
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,640
when will someone really seriously say something about what's happening in the world today?

413
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,640
You know, what a missed opportunity that was.

414
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,640
I certainly didn't think it was funny.

415
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,640
You know, and I'm a big fan of using comedy and humor to talk about serious issues,

416
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,640
but I found that a tremendously large, you know, missed opportunity.

417
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
It just didn't work for me at all.

418
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,640
If you haven't seen it,

419
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,640
don't just look at the Colbert thing, which is at the end.

420
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,640
But look at every single guy that stands up there and talks and,

421
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,640
oh, man, it's Hollywood.

422
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,640
It was, it's politics.

423
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,640
It's show business for ugly people.

424
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
It really is.

425
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,640
It's just, it kind of disgusted me.

426
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,640
Coming up on a serious stars 102 as we head into the weekend.

427
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,640
We have, oh, great.

428
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
We've got a Wichita brother for it on tonight.

429
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,640
That'll be on it to 9 to 9 to 9 30 East Coast time, CC Chapman,

430
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
closing out the entire evening.

431
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,640
And just in a few moments from out Pacific Coast,

432
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
Hellway with Mark Yoshimoto,

433
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,640
Namcoff in the Pacific Coast, Hellway players,

434
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,640
East Radio Dawn and Drew.

435
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,640
And with a bit of like Gilmore Daily,

436
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
I think he was at the On Hollywood conference,

437
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,640
so they'll probably have some interesting guests on there.

438
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,640
And we'll be back Monday right here on serious stars 102

439
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,640
for you checking us out on the satellite radio.

440
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
If you want to hear the rest of the show,

441
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,640
you'll have to go to dailysourceco.com to download it all

442
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
and check out more great podcasts at podshow.com.

443
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,640
And thank you all so much for sending all those great messages

444
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
from Portsmouth.

445
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
That's where Patricia and I went to see Joan Collins.

446
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
Wow.

447
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,640
It seems like I got a lot of listeners in Portsmouth.

448
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,640
And it really is an interesting looking town

449
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,640
and Patricia and I definitely plan on going back soon

450
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,640
to see it during the daytime.

451
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
They even had, what is it called?

452
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,640
You know, the self-proclaimed seven star hotel in Dubai,

453
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,640
the Boersh, Arap Hotel that looks like a big sailboat.

454
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,640
There's like a mini version of that in Portsmouth,

455
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,640
which is the weirdest thing.

456
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,640
There's very picturesque old world type of English

457
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,640
seaside town or harbor town, I would say.

458
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,640
And then there's this very modern structure with a blue sail at night,

459
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
which wasn't ugly by the way.

460
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
It fit in very nicely.

461
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
But what's the story with that?

462
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,640
And thank you all so much for checking out the source code

463
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,640
and for those of you who have been calling into our voice mail line.

464
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,640
Yeah, this is Scott TD in Saskatoon.

465
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
I love your phone idea.

466
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
There's one problem with it.

467
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,640
You're going to get people calling in drunk.

468
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,640
Now, I know you might not intended to,

469
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,640
but trust me, it's going to happen.

470
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,640
Because half the podcast I listened to,

471
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,640
have a phone number for that exact purpose,

472
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,640
so people can call in well drunk or other forms of intoxication

473
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,640
like you enjoy.

474
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,640
So just to warn you, hopefully you don't get mad people

475
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,640
for doing that because I probably will eventually at some point

476
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,640
because well, it's a lot of fun because you really can say

477
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,640
whatever you want and the stories that I have come up with

478
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,640
already on the unemployment line,

479
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,640
check them out at unemploymentshow.com and the strange brewed

480
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,640
at the strange food.com.

481
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,640
They're, they're drunk dies from all over the world,

482
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
are hilarious.

483
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,640
And I think that it could quite add to the show,

484
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,640
but also subtract from it because you might have

485
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
too much time going through these.

486
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,640
Yo, I saw Mr. Curry.

487
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,640
Like in stuff like that.

488
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,640
I got a lot of that this morning.

489
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640
And I, yeah.

490
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,640
Some say, and we've had this conversation a lot of pod shows,

491
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
like well, you need to get a producer,

492
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,640
but I think that if I had a producer who would pre-screen

493
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,640
the emails and the voice emails and the audio feedback,

494
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,640
then I might as well just become a regular radio guy,

495
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
you know, walks in.

496
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Oh, here I am, five minutes before the show,

497
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,640
which by the way is exactly the way it works.

498
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,640
And the producer's got a lot of stuff,

499
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
and he's been working for hours.

500
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
I think that's a big part of this.

501
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
You've got to be down to the trenches.

502
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
You've got to be doing it yourself,

503
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,640
because I am the show, not a producer.

504
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
I mean, I could certainly use someone

505
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
to do other things for me,

506
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
like pay the bills,

507
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
take care of my schedule,

508
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
clean up my office,

509
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Roger Smalls, where are you?

510
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,640
Hello, Adam.

511
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,640
This is Lorenzo Longness.

512
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,640
You may remember me from my hit series,

513
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,640
Renegade, where I played,

514
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,640
along with my big girlfriend, Kathleen Kinmont.

515
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,640
I've been listening to the chat,

516
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,640
John, I think we have something in common,

517
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,640
a literary tradition.

518
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,640
I want to introduce you to the certified center

519
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,640
for a literary tradition.

520
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,640
Just some examples.

521
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,640
You have the curry castle, the curry cottage,

522
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
the curry condo,

523
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
now the poggio palace,

524
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,640
kind of surprise that your name isn't Adam,

525
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,640
something I guess Adam,

526
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,640
and it was taken in Adam Adams,

527
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,640
would be a little too close,

528
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,640
but maybe Carl Currie.

529
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
Carl doesn't really fit,

530
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,640
Kurt Currie,

531
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,640
and that's too close to Kurt Loader.

532
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,640
Anyway, Adam,

533
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,640
I think you need help.

534
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
I think you need to check out the certified center

535
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,640
for a literary tradition addiction.

536
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,640
Besides that, the way I get help is

537
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,640
I listen to the daddy cast.

538
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,640
It helps me cope with my problems

539
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,640
and help my children

540
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,640
little Larry Lombus,

541
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,640
and Lucy Lombus, who is named after Lucy Wallace.

542
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,640
Adam, please get help,

543
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,640
and please say hi to your wife,

544
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,640
Patricia Pai,

545
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
and your daughter, Christina Currie,

546
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,640
wait a minute.

547
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,640
Your sickness is more than I thought.

548
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,640
Adam, get help now,

549
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,640
and listen to the daddy cast.

550
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,640
That's a promo, man.

551
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,640
It's true.

552
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,640
I do suffer from what you call it,

553
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
a literacy?

554
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
What was that?

555
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,640
It was something weird, weird name.

556
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
Yeah, I like that, man.

557
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,640
I like it.

558
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,640
We've got the curry cats.

559
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,640
We've got the damn dog.

560
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,640
And yes, the Chacha.

561
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,640
Hi, Adam.

562
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,640
It's Karen from RumorGirl.com.

563
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,640
And I'm calling because I was really

564
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,640
getting annoyed with all the talk about second life.

565
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,640
Until yesterday, when we did-

566
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
This, by the way, is a very typical story.

567
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
Very, very typical story.

568
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,640
I've received many of these,

569
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
but because it's come from the RumorGirls

570
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
around the Pod Show podcast network,

571
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
I really had to play this for her.

572
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,640
I tried to do our podcast,

573
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,640
and I was over at Carolyn Frank's place.

574
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,640
And we just-

575
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
The Carla cast.

576
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
Frank, please, second life all the time.

577
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,640
And I'm like, what is the big deal about second life?

578
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
So I looked at it.

579
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
I saw the curry mansion,

580
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,640
and I saw that obnoxious pod cast pickle thing behind you guys,

581
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
or, yeah, I think it is behind.

582
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Yeah, it was just so annoying.

583
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,640
And I was still like,

584
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
what the heck?

585
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,640
What is so great about this stupid second life?

586
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,640
And what's all the talk about it?

587
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,640
And even in our podcast, Carla,

588
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
and I talked about it,

589
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,640
and we said, we just want Adam to go back

590
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,640
to his normal Charlie.

591
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
That's all we want.

592
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
And so anyway,

593
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,640
today I'm listening to the Charlie number 380,

594
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,640
and I'm listening to people talking about it.

595
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
Now I feel addicted.

596
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
Why?

597
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,640
Because now I know what they're talking about.

598
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
I know about the mansion.

599
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,640
They're talking about a couple of people.

600
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
I'm thinking, I think I saw them yesterday.

601
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,640
And now I'm thinking about getting second life.

602
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
What are you getting me addicted to?

603
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
Now, first of all, with pod cast thing,

604
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
now it's a stupid second life.

605
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Great.

606
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
I can't even deal with my first life.

607
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,640
Now I'm onto my second life.

608
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Anyway, I just wanted to say that

609
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,640
I love being a part of pod shell,

610
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
and check us out at rumorgirls.com,

611
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,640
and I'll talk to you soon.

612
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,640
Thanks.

613
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,640
You'll be your baby.

614
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,640
Thank you so much.

615
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,640
Now, I'm not going to talk about it anymore.

616
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
I'm not going to talk about any of my experiences

617
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,640
in second life anymore.

618
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,640
I'm not going to do it.

619
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,640
See you in five years when we're all in there.

620
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
Hey, Adam.

621
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
This is you.

622
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
It's on here.

623
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
You're neighbor at Ferris.

624
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
Just going to say hi,

625
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,640
and standing in my office looking at the Delta Sierra.

626
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,640
You're parked in the hangar right outside my little workshop window,

627
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,640
and she's very clean and tidy.

628
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,640
Nobody's back to other aircraft until he'll be delighted.

629
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,640
She's lovely.

630
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Did you get the notes?

631
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,640
I left on her the other day with a picture of the diesel power there,

632
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,640
craft us for and check you the other day.

633
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,640
Very cool.

634
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,640
Anyway, thanks a lot.

635
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
See you here at Ferris.

636
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
One of these days.

637
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,640
Oh, you forgot to say tailwinds.

638
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
In that nice,

639
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,640
these are people that only know me through the daily source code.

640
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,640
I love that.

641
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
That's so incredible.

642
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,640
I got a call from from Jason at the tower this morning.

643
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,640
Said, hey, Adam, how you doing?

644
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,640
Hey, look, I got your customs form because you have to,

645
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
if you come in from outside the UK,

646
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,640
you have to every single time you have to file a,

647
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,640
actually, is that a customs form?

648
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,640
It's an immigration form, I think it is.

649
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,640
Is it?

650
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,640
Is it immigration?

651
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,640
I think, well, immigration to customs.

652
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,640
So you have to file a form.

653
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,640
It's really easy.

654
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,640
You fill it out.

655
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
You have to do a flight plan anyway,

656
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
and then you fax it off.

657
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
And you fax a copy to the,

658
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,640
to the airfield we're going to land.

659
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
And it was so cool.

660
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,640
Jason said, hey, Adam, I don't miss Jason here.

661
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
That's right.

662
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
That was the jury is still out if,

663
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,640
if Roger Smalls doesn't work in the, in the control tower at,

664
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,640
at the pharaohs airfield.

665
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
He says, I got your immigration form,

666
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,640
but you might want to send it again

667
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,640
because it wasn't really legible.

668
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,640
But I heard yesterday on the podcast that you're coming,

669
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,640
you're going to see your mom and Roger dams.

670
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,640
So I, I assume that's what it is,

671
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,640
but you know,

672
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
we don't want to have another visit from,

673
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
from customs or immigration.

674
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
So why don't you just refax it?

675
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,640
I was like, wow, man, this is some reach we've got.

676
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,640
This is really cool.

677
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
So indeed,

678
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,640
I am going to see my mom again tomorrow.

679
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,640
Um,

680
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,640
I hope she's,

681
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,640
well, I'll give you a report on Monday.

682
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
Yeah.

683
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
She sounds great on the phone.

684
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
She has a good day.

685
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,640
She has her bad days.

686
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,640
She literally says sometimes.

687
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,640
She says, well, you know,

688
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
yesterday,

689
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,640
so that I got,

690
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,640
I had a real bad day.

691
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
So that I did dip.

692
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,640
I didn't give a,

693
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,640
so here's my mom talking, right?

694
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
I don't give a fuck or I didn't give a fuck yesterday.

695
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,640
I don't care.

696
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
I don't care.

697
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
I know you'd be disappointed in me,

698
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
but I don't care about anybody.

699
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
And, you know,

700
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
so two men.

701
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
And I keep telling her,

702
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
that's, that's when you got to call me,

703
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,640
mom.

704
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,640
What is that?

705
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,640
That's the recycle bin dudes.

706
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,640
They're late today.

707
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,640
I was bank holiday,

708
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
of course.

709
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
That's why.

710
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,640
So,

711
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,640
uh,

712
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
going tomorrow and Patricia is sending me off with,

713
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,640
uh,

714
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
some of her famous soup.

715
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,640
Uh,

716
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
because my mom has to eat more.

717
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,640
She's got to eat more.

718
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
Hey,

719
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,640
if any of you who are listening live in Los Angeles,

720
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,640
uh,

721
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
I don't know if you listen to KLA,

722
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
uh,

723
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,640
but I got a very interesting voice mail,

724
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
uh,

725
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,640
regarding that,

726
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,640
and I don't quite understand it.

727
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,640
Hi, Adam.

728
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,640
Uh,

729
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,640
so was that room of you on PLA radio?

730
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
I heard you,

731
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,640
but,

732
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,640
uh,

733
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,640
I wasn't sure if you were live or not,

734
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
and you didn't say anything about it.

735
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,640
So,

736
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,640
I was just calling you curious,

737
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,640
but you sounded wonderful,

738
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,640
and you got the good work.

739
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,640
Bye.

740
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,640
So now I'm not sure if you said KLA,

741
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,640
or P-

742
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,640
Shut up!

743
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,640
They're backing up into the cul-de-sac.

744
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,640
I don't know if she said KLA,

745
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,640
or if she said PLA,

746
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,640
but did anyone hear me on the radio in Los Angeles?

747
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,640
Uh,

748
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,640
it makes no sense to me.

749
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,640
Uh,

750
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,640
here,

751
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,640
here,

752
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,640
this is a sound seeing tour of the,

753
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,640
uh,

754
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,640
the cottage,

755
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,640
recycle pickup,

756
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,640
recycle it.

757
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
Don't waste it.

758
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
Call the recycling hotline.

759
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
Oh,

760
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,640
1483,

761
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
445,

762
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
084.

763
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,640
There's a bunch of guys with no t-shirts on outside my house.

764
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,640
Hmm.

765
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,640
Okay.

766
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,640
So, well, that's going on in the background,

767
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
because it's,

768
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
it's not all irritating.

769
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,640
I,

770
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
uh,

771
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,640
I kind of broke format a little bit,

772
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,640
the other day,

773
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,640
if you can call it that,

774
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,640
and uh,

775
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
and it's solicited some feedback

776
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
on the Iranian situation.

777
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,640
And,

778
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,640
and not because I want to get deep into politics

779
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,640
and talk about stuff,

780
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,640
I really want to understand it,

781
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
because it just,

782
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,640
it makes,

783
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,640
what I'm hearing,

784
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
what I'm reading makes so little sense to me.

785
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

786
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,640
Uh,

787
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
makes so little say,

788
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,640
this is what podcasting is all about.

789
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,640
We don't,

790
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
What sound proof studios?

791
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
We ain't got no,

792
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,640
just thanking sound proof studios?

793
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,640
And I just wanted to see if anyone had any views,

794
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,640
and well,

795
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
some appreciated the thoughts

796
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,640
some didn't,

797
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,640
and some actually had some very interesting insights.

798
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:03,120
sites. Hey Adam, it's Ryan from Rhode Island. Thanks for that really loud beep on the

799
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,660
answering service there. That's fun to my ear. Sorry about leaving a message on

800
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,820
a cell phone. I know you said try not to do that, but here I am doing that. Just

801
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,980
wanted to call in way in a little bit on the Iran topic that you brought up

802
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:23,040
here today's source code was at 358. I have to say the comment that you made about

803
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,440
Jacob, who seems to be right on the funny, feels the same thing right now. Every

804
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,060
time I see Bush leaned it over the podium. It seems like I could just picture

805
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,780
him as a school yard bully waiting to punch somebody in the nose. And I was

806
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,980
talking a few people that worked for me who are pretty much directly immigrated

807
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,920
from Iran. And they're really worried too. Their families are there and they've been

808
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,080
trying to make plans to move people around and see who can stay with who will

809
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,320
outside the country. Because they're just worried about number one

810
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,920
higher administration and number two, the Iranian administration. That's

811
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:05,040
sub-situation and I really don't want to see this thing on full the way. It looks

812
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,840
like it's gotten. Anyway, take care and thanks a lot, bye.

813
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:16,480
Hey Adam, what's going on? I'm the sort of fact winner of the StickWorld podcast. I'm

814
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:24,280
currently driving in my car here in Las Vegas, so 97 degrees. I have the

815
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,040
air conditioning on full blast and it's still hot. Anyway, so I just had to

816
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,240
call in about this. I'm still in the middle of listening to a number 380, so

817
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,120
number 380, where you asked about people right in or call in or send a feedback

818
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:45,000
about their opinions on what's going on with Iran and the UN and the US and all

819
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,520
that stuff. Now, this is just my opinion and I'm going to keep it really short

820
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,320
because I've already recorded this net this three times and it was like three

821
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,480
minutes long. Anyway, I don't think that you should have done that. I just

822
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,120
think we remember you a few shows that you were saying you didn't want to talk

823
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:05,320
about this stuff. So what made you change your mind? And I know I noticed when you

824
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,080
when you asked for the feedback that you're a little apprehensive too, but it's

825
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,120
kind of curious what's going on in your head. And you know, I don't know about other

826
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,080
people, but I kind of use the daily source code to get away from stuff like that.

827
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,680
You know, we get it in the newspaper, we get it on the radio, we get it in TV.

828
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,520
Everybody's talking about it, you know, and it's kind of nice to not have

829
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:33,240
something out there where you're not having to deal with it for 40

830
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,320
minutes at a time, 45 minutes at a time. You know, it's kind of like like podcast,

831
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,880
you can kind of pick and choose what you want listen to. You know, I

832
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,440
subscribe to over 25 podcasts that I listen to every day. And none of them are

833
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,200
political. And to be honest with you, actually none of them talk about politics

834
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,600
either, which is kind of nice. And so I just had to call in, I had to get back to

835
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,960
the show. I got a listen, because I got 24 other podcasts to get to you

836
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,520
before the day is over. There's one of the call in and give you my opinion on

837
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,240
that. So, and I guess because I may a student pilot, I can say this, tell

838
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,760
it. Yeah, right on man. Of course you can. You've got that right. You've

839
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,520
earned the right. You're in the machine. You're in sheet metal with rivets

840
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,640
my friend. Of course, you can say tailwinds. In that cool from Rhode Island to

841
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:22,120
Vegas, a through iPods and MP3s, it still blows me away. What's happening?

842
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:28,520
I'm standing here and it wouldn't console in a spare bedroom in England. I

843
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,120
love that. Now, I don't want to get political. I'm, you know, just a

844
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,480
couple of observations. First of all, I'm really, really, really tired of

845
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,200
people beating up on any political leader. I'm tired of it. Okay. I'm tired of

846
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,960
people beating up on Bush, on Blair, on any, any leader. You know, it's

847
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,600
more than just the leader, because the people still have those people,

848
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,760
certainly still have the power in their own hands to change the world.

849
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,120
And the interesting is happening here, although I don't know if it's good or

850
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:02,520
bad, but the British nationalist party is that that would be in peace

851
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,680
stands for their winning local elections, or they won a significant amount of

852
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:12,680
local elections in the UK, which means Tony Blair's labor party just might

853
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,280
be on the way out when the next elections occur, which is also quite a

854
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,240
mystery to me how elections are called here in the UK. So again, the reason

855
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,320
is not, it's, I don't want any, I'm not interested in really political

856
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,960
talk. I am interested in the world around us than what's happening. And

857
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,120
when I hear all this atomic shit over and over again, that's when all

858
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:38,200
my alarm bells go off from saying, you know, it just doesn't make sense.

859
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:43,000
You know, there you've got our buddy in Rhode Island who's got friends who have

860
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,040
family in Iran and they're concerned and they're trying to move their

861
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,080
family out. I mean, so it's clearly not the Iranians. It's not those

862
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,720
Iranians who want to, you know, nuke me or or nuke you. Is it really the

863
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,760
leaders? Is that really who's doing it? Or is this something else

864
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:03,320
to play here? Hey, Adam, this is Chris and the financial aid podcast with a

865
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,400
tin foil hat moment on Iran. Here's a very quick primer and oil using

866
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,920
second life as an example. Right now, there are two exchanges for oil,

867
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,760
9x in New York and the IPE in London. All major transactions on the world

868
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,880
market are in US dollars, which is a great benefit to the US economy.

869
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,360
It means that all countries wanting to buy petroleum products on the

870
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,560
world market must have US dollars in their federal reserves purchased from

871
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,680
the United States, just like you purchased linden's and second life from the

872
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,840
linden corporation. However, Iran is setting up an exchange of its own

873
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,840
supposedly we go online this month called the Iranian oil boss.

874
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,920
Its chosen currency will be the euro, not the dollar. If the Iranian oil

875
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,640
boss becomes wildly successful on the world market and there's a good

876
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,280
reason to believe that it may as countries such as China would welcome the

877
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,520
chance to use a currency not linked to the US. Then some economists believe that

878
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:52,200
up to 20% of the currency being used in international oil trade could be the

879
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,360
euro. That's 20% fewer dollars being bought in first life for oil.

880
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,560
The effect on the US economy would be devastating as we require massive

881
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,440
infusions on a daily basis of foreign countries purchasing

882
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,360
our currency and our debt. Having 20% fewer dollars being used in

883
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,960
international oil trade could tip the US economy into recession quite easily

884
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,920
and even forced the US government to potentially hyper inflate its currency to

885
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,240
avoid default. Well, any of this come to pass? It's hard to say, but it's

886
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,520
definitely food for thought and certainly more information out there that

887
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,480
you can use to make decisions when you're watching the media.

888
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,840
This is Chris from the Financial Aid podcast at financialadpodcast.com

889
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,760
tune in daily. It's for financial aid news and disturbing tinfoil hat moments.

890
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,400
Take care Adam. Do you can check in any time you want with disturbing tinfoil hat moments like

891
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,040
that. Thank you so much. Now things start to come into the picture for me. Now I'm

892
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:47,080
understanding it. Okay. It's about things apparently it looks like stuff is not about

893
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:52,120
atomic energy or weapons of mass destruction at all. This is all about economics.

894
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,440
I haven't read that anywhere and I read the, you know, that recycled piece of shit, the

895
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,000
financial times. I say recycled piece of shit because it's printed on, you know, like yellow

896
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,480
recycled paper. So I guess that's it then. Discredit those guys because they're trying to take

897
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,640
our business. That would make sense. And then there's this whole pipeline business. You know,

898
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,840
we really are in the middle ages still when it comes to the world stage.

899
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,480
It's all about turf. It's all about money. It's all about who's, who's the boss of who

900
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:33,960
is coming. Yes. Comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip

901
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,720
can't start a weekend without a note from CSB. Hello, Adam Kerry. How are you?

902
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:47,560
So I am just a listener of your show. I would like to suggest you something as a listener.

903
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:56,840
Namely, one of my favorite radio presenters has a number of correspondence who are regular

904
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:05,160
listeners appointed by him to report on subjects such as video games, London Underground,

905
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:13,640
urban, music, urban music etc. The opportunity to become a correspondent is a very, very

906
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:23,240
one and much valued by listeners of this radio presenter. I hereby suggest Adam Kerry that you

907
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:28,360
too will appoint some correspondence on various topics and let them plaque the topics

908
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,600
or podcasts and you would play their shot of your reports on regular basis. Once a month for

909
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:40,360
example. I volunteer for being a correspondent on European Union, but I reckon that several

910
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:46,520
people would volunteer as correspondence on various topics and areas of interest. Just ask your listeners.

911
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:56,200
So have a nice weekend mate and move your skinny ass out of this fucking gulfot to admire the rest

912
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:04,760
of beautiful UK too. Dood, I admire it plenty. I saw Portsmouth just the other night and tomorrow

913
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,920
I'll be flying over, dover and all kinds of other wonderful places. It's beautiful and as a pilot

914
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,640
you have such a different perspective on the land that you live on. So I enjoy it. You know,

915
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:21,320
comic strip that I think that's exactly not the way to go. Everybody, every listener of the show

916
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:27,000
as far as I'm concerned is a correspondent. Whatever's going on in your piece of the world,

917
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,760
you know, or in the piece of your life. Let me know about it. Our voice mail phone numbers are 201-625-635-7.

918
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:39,080
That's our number in Jersey. Still proud to be the Jersey boy. And of course, in the UK,

919
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:45,400
London, O2O-768-1375-3. I'm going to drop the Yanks versus the Brits for the Friday festivities

920
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,800
because I wanted to play one more song. We're already moving way past the 40-minute mark and this

921
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,880
one is about pod save music and you know that's close to my heart. Hi Adam, it's been

922
00:45:53,880 --> 00:46:00,280
downing. I listen a song in Melbourne, Australia and on the Charlie 374 you played Mr. Lovely

923
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,360
by Beth Thunley. If you don't remember the song, he's a quick snippet.

924
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,280
Actually, like there are songs so much dumb to Beth's website where I listen to

925
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:30,280
so many other songs that she had on there and I decided to purchase her album. Beth has

926
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:36,680
installed me that I'm the first to train to purchase her album and it's an artist I would never have

927
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:42,280
heard of if it wasn't for the pod save music network and the daily source code. So thank you, Adam.

928
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,560
No, dude, thank you so much. Are you kidding me? I'm glad you remind me of that song.

929
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,960
I don't think so. You must be good, please, Beth. That's much better.

930
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,320
Straight off the pod save music network, Beth Thunley for your weekend festivity kickoff.

931
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:25,240
It's the song. In the morning I'm probably done here by luck. I can't say you'd be long gone.

932
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,800
Oh, Mr. Lovely.

933
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:46,280
There's no, there's no, there's no, there's no, there's no.

934
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,520
That ain't never aọ's.

935
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,280
He has a pricey. He has a pricey.

936
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:58,080
Looks like a hope.

937
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:02,200
Oh, she urge you knocked everybody into the world.

938
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,840
In one day, she reminds me of her song.

939
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,400
I don't know that time she'll find this show.

940
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,840
No, I know the more it lurks

941
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:20,200
No more I hate my head deeper

942
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,880
Oh, Mr. Lovely

943
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,120
I'll see you again

944
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,160
Oh, Mr. Lovely

945
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,640
You want to grow my friend

946
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,640
Well, you're active in the middle and can't wait

947
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,560
You're just a slave in the morning

948
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,120
You're just walking in the rain, can't you?

949
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,280
There's no shame in the rain

950
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:12,040
Let's roll up and take you to the restaurant and be on a day

951
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,040
Bethorne Lee, Mr. Lovely

952
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,400
If you think and why does Adam suck so bad on the cowbell?

953
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,680
I just want you to know that I don't really have the proper proper equipment yet because I've been using a pencil

954
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:29,560
All right, and and the pencil just doesn't have the right, you know, girth or length or weight to really get into the rhythm, all right

955
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,960
So I want you to know that there are obstacles in my in my cowbell playing and I'm really trying to

956
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:41,560
Had a really nice email conversation with Beth or since I played her the first time and it's so nice to see

957
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:46,840
Someone fresh and new to potsafe music to go like wow, what is happening here? You know all of a sudden

958
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:52,760
I'm people buying my stuff and Australia sending me email and and it's lovely to see that happen

959
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,400
It really is said, Mr. Lovely, right?

960
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,120
Okay, I told you about the the potsafe music

961
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,560
Some are stuff that we're working on and now

962
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,560
I haven't really discussed this with the sales and marketing team, but just think

963
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:18,040
Parks think big parks think all around America think wouldn't it be great if you could go see

964
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,960
A potsafe music showcase

965
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,880
In a really professional environment wouldn't that be cool?

966
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,320
Okay, now there's only a couple of them so and and trust me. It's not the mouse house, okay?

967
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,960
You know Anna and this is Regis from unemploymentshow.com

968
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,320
AKA Regis the soda and second life

969
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:46,360
I've been out there about a week now checking it out due to your suggestion and most of that time has been me screwing on with my avatar

970
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:52,440
Trying to get a good outfit going and you know trying to fix the size of my nose by look good and I realize what we need

971
00:50:52,440 --> 00:51:00,360
We need the second life Metro sexual moment. We need somebody that can help people with their hair style and tell me what color would be and

972
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,600
You know, I guess I get a pot show t-shirt that would take care of most of my outfit

973
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:09,640
But yeah, the second life Metro sexual moment is a good way for you to expand it

974
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,520
Also regarding second life. I don't get to outplayer. I play in a cover band and we do

975
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:21,560
Anything from the Beatles to Tom Jones to, you know, Rick Springfield or Stone Temple pilots

976
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:28,200
We do you know everything from pretty much to the rock genre and I was thinking that if we get the streaming thing worked on online

977
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,680
That I could be a good opening act if you had the videos playing at the castle sometime

978
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:37,720
You know because I can take a lot of requests if I could just you know show up with my acoustic guitar and

979
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,280
You know get the cloud gone before the the main act come on that would be really cool to do

980
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:47,880
Or if you're having a party just want to throw me on the roof and just you know party up there people and you know play some tunes

981
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:53,480
That would be fun too, so but I don't know about the streaming thing, you know my process are kind of wigs out as it is on second life

982
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,320
It's probably because I have too many tabs open and fire fox at the same time, so

983
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,760
So there you go second life. I got a sign off here

984
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,680
I can't see tailwinds I'm not a pilot. I can't say I can't do the wider flick

985
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,680
I don't even do that stuff anymore unfortunately

986
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,640
But I did think of one thing that I could sign off with and that would be to wish you many blow jobs

987
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:17,800
So so BJs Adam and I'm hoping this catches on because I really want to hear comic strip bloggers say

988
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:23,160
The low jobs and in charity or how about you know Roger small doing it?

989
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,160
May the blow jobs see with you Adam

990
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,200
There you go buddy, we'll be getting many and

991
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:34,920
Many blow jobs in the next week. Thank you later. Oh man at first I'm like no not another second life comment

992
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,600
But then you really pulled it out man. I appreciate that. Yeah, many BJs to you

993
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:43,800
And may you receive or shall you give this weekend either one is fine. Let's have more those this weekend, okay?

994
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,400
Get your ass out of second life and let's concentrate on blow jobs

995
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,400
