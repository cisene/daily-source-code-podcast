Delta Sierra Charley, 363.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hello, I'm Adam Curry.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000

right now, then come on over.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Cause I am the master.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Pod Caster.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That same sturdy.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is that dirty, Peed Up?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That same too, dirty.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Transmidders?

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We don't need nuss.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I like to think I'm flying.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you want to...

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Pod Castan, it's Adam Curry.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
She comes to me and nice.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The moon shines through my window.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But you whispered in my ear.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Those amazing words I never thought I hear.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But she said, yeah.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Just close your eyes.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Lay our hands down.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And let your fairness be staying.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hold on now, cause I take you over this down tonight.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
On my magic cup, it's all on time.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll take you away from the rising light.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The places you never ever been before.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
As we passed in your bonestar.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But she said, you never do so.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All struck by my fears.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And I saw that all the dreams.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I didn't see it like red.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Who we played I'd see.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And she said, yeah.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Just close your eyes.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Lay our hands down.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And let your fairness be staying.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hold on now, cause I take you over this down tonight.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
On my magic cup, it's all on time.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll take you away from the rising light.

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The places you never ever been before.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
All that I didn't see.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Just close your eyes.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Just close your eyes.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Lay our hands down.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let your fairness be staying overnight.

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And I'll take you over this down tonight.

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
On my magic cup, it's all on time.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll take you over the rising light.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll take you over now, I'll take you over this down tonight.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:26,000
On my magic cup, it's all on time.

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll take you away from the rising light.

59
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The places you never ever been before.

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You face down, yeah, I'll be there to you.

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The places you never ever been before.

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's another one of those songs, man.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Just can't get it out of my head.

64
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It has a combination of so many different things.

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I really like it.

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Pretty, pretty song.

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's from New Leaf.

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Song is titled Magic Carpet.

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Now, guess where they come from.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Nope.

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Nope.

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Nope.

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
They come from Sweden.

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's right.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I didn't actually realize that until I just pulled up the page on the podcast of music.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Now, where I tagged it a long time ago, my playlist to play.

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There you go.

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Loving it from music.podshow.com.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Well, good afternoon or good morning, everybody.

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Probably good afternoon where you're listening to this show right now because it's a little bit later than normal.

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This morning after dropping Christina off at school, I jetted back to the cottage.

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Immediately begged Patricia to do my hair because I had a meeting in London.

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Which is actually quite convenient.

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I was so surprised.

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I was able, you know, I was back.

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,000
To see, I left the house at, was at 930 and I was on the east side of London and 11 o'clock from my meeting with British telecom.

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And the reason for that, of course, is that, you know, there's not, not often that you get an opportunity to sit with the top brass twice in quick succession.

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So I felt it was more than warranted to despite all the packing and the last minute stuff we're doing.

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And of course, I do have double days here.

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So this all fits into the pre San Francisco awakening hours.

91
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And I was back.

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I was back sitting in the big green ugly chair, which, for those of you who have been listening to the show since the curry castle days,

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
the big old green ugly thing just went right along with me.

94
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I still, you can sit still my recliner.

95
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And I was sitting here about like 230.

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It was fantastic.

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Actually, I was back at the station at 130.

98
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The car was waiting for me 145.

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I was home.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Fantastic.

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It did not a nice day.

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So I'm looking forward to leaving.

103
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
As you know, we're going to Portugal to the Algarve.

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And we leave tomorrow.

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I will put up a thank God.

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's Friday show just to get us a whole new mood, of course.

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And after that, we're at a here.

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So I can't say too much about the B.T. meeting, but you pay podcasters.

109
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Doing stuff for you guys here.

110
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Thanks for all getting touched with me.

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I was at the Guardian Media Conference, the Changing Media Summit.

112
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There's like, you know, one podcaster.

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's okay.

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's fine.

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Just don't complain that we're not doing anything when we get it all rolling.

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Lots of stuff going on.

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Plenty of stuff in the form of feedback.

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It sounds like this.

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hey Adam.

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's listener Jeff.

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And looking on dig today.

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And there's this huge set of comments about this.

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
A ledge, podshow contract on the Keith and the girl podcast.

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And I think we need to hear a podshow side of the story, also.

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I really don't believe the things that people are saying.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And since there's nothing that I can actually read.

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't know who's blown smoke out of who's asked or what.

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So what's the deal?

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Is this legit?

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Is it complete total BS made for fun?

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And you're just having, they're just pulling shots at you.

133
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Or what's going on?

134
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let us know.

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay.

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Well, obviously our response was all taking everything kind of ingest.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But it's interesting when I look at dig and all that.

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's amazing how creative people can be when insulting me.

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It never ceases.

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It never ceases to amaze me.

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let me set a couple things very straight.

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
First of all, podshow is not an ad network.

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay.

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's the big disconnect here.

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We are not an ad insertion company where we do a revenue split and publish everything up front

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
with the contracts and the agreements.

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Now, that's stuff that podtrack and keep trying.

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And man, I'm trying to think of a couple more.

149
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Podtrack, keep trying.

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
There's more.

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay.

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Send me which actually have a list of which ones there are.

153
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
These guys, they state their information publicly because they're like ad cents.

154
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is very typical of where I think the podcast and community is turning left

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and we should be turning right.

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You know, the Google Adsense model, go look at your check.

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Tell me how big it is.

158
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay.

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Because that's probably going to be about the size of your check if you use these types

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
of ad insertion networks.

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And the whole point there is that advertisers show up themselves.

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And oh, not a lot of all of them I have to say.

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But it's, you know, they publish a rate card.

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So, you know, if you look at the rate card for Keith and the girl,

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and it says they have approximately 257,000 downloads in a month, which is good.

166
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I have to say, but hey, no, don't and Drew.

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And they charge $67 per 1000.

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So, you can almost do the math if they were completely sold out.

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
They would actually be doing pretty good.

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But the question is, how do you get completely sold out?

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And how do you, how do you justify a cost per 1000?

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The so-called CPM?

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I think that's the wrong way to go.

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What Pod show does is we market the relationship

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
between the podcast or the pod, the proofs of the podcast and their audience,

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
which we find far more valuable than $67 per 1000 downloads.

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So, we don't have any contracts like that.

178
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So, we're not going to publish anything.

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We don't discuss our private contracts with the podcasters that have joined the network.

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And quite honestly, when a podcaster joins the network,

181
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
it's not just signing of a contract.

182
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
There's a whole discussion.

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
There's a contacts.

184
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There's an often trips to the office, so we can discuss things.

185
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
How do we build the future for a podcaster?

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What can the network provide for you?

187
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What type of advertisers are we looking at?

188
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What kind of promotions?

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
How do we drive listeners?

190
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And that's really the key point that I want to make.

191
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The insults that are flying around is that...

192
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And it's not even Pod show.

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's me personally.

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's the funniest thing that I love reading it.

195
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That I'm raping podcasters for my own benefit.

196
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah, you clearly misunderstand.

197
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Pod show, as we've said from day one, is about listeners.

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We're about getting the audience in, okay?

199
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And audience comes for several different reasons.

200
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But that connection is what we're making.

201
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We're not going out there trying to snap up as many podcasters.

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We can't even... it's not scalable the way we're doing it.

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We're creating a network of shows that we feel will draw an audience

204
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and the audience will not be disappointed when they come to podshow.com

205
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and try out that podcasting thing.

206
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So now, of course, I'm not going to discuss any contracts.

207
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And if you do receive a contract from Pod show,

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
then I suggest you talk to a lawyer

209
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and don't take your advice from Keith and the girl.

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That being said, with the, you know, standing on one leg

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and praising Murphy and all that stuff,

212
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
we're hoping to go public beta with podshow plus and the pdn,

213
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
the podshow delivery network around...

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Well, it's supposed to be... the schedule says April 13th,

215
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
but I'll just say, let's take the worst day in our lives,

216
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
which would be April 15th, tax day.

217
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And let's make that a little bit brighter.

218
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
By then, we should have it up and rolling,

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and there will be multiple levels.

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And for people who just want to come in and use the network

221
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and don't want to join the podshow family,

222
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
that we plenty of opportunity for you.

223
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
All kinds of you can even pay for it

224
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and just take the services with no advertising whatsoever.

225
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Those, of course, will be published.

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But the level that we're talking at here is something completely different.

227
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So that's about all I really have to say about it.

228
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And it's just, again, amazing.

229
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Amazing how creative the insults have gotten.

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Hey Adam, this is Chris from the Financial Aid podcast

231
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
with some audio feedback about taking people's names into vain.

232
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
From the Buddhist perspective, which is the perspective I associate

233
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
with the most, there are three general reasons why you shouldn't do this.

234
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
None of which actually have to do with respect.

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The first is taking people, the names that people are taking into vain

236
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
are names that are connected with the, I guess we'll call it the sacred.

237
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You know what, let me just set this up.

238
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
If you haven't heard the previous episodes,

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
this started with Steve Web of the Life Spring podcast

240
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
who respectfully asked me to not use Jesus Christ in a derogatory way.

241
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Which I totally understand, I'm trying to respect.

242
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Not just for Steve Web, but for other listeners of my show.

243
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't care about anyone else.

244
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
My listeners, you know, within my own community.

245
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And that has sparked a pretty interesting conversation about what does it mean to take

246
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
the Lord's name in vain or anyone's name in vain for that matter.

247
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And I've gotten lots of feedback, but this one from the Financial Aid podcast

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
is pretty good.

249
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Listen to some more.

250
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The ability to switch between your ordinary everyday mind and the mind

251
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
that is focused on spiritual practice is very, very difficult to combine.

252
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
One of the ways that you get there is the use of sacred names, words, and rituals.

253
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's kind of like warm-ups before concert.

254
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You make the transition from everyday mind to empowered mind.

255
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
By using the words and sounds connected with the sacred in the context of the

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
profane, you dilute the power.

257
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You make it that much harder to get the groove when it comes to spiritual practice.

258
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
In Buddhism, we reserve power words and names for times when they'll do us the most good.

259
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Using the amount of context, it's like a police officer firing warning shots.

260
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
They're loud and all, but if he needs those both to save his life, he should

261
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
out of luck.

262
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Second, you actually have proven this more than anything with this and say

263
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
or burping.

264
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
In addition to power dilution, if you consistently use any deities name and

265
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
link it to negative experiences, the guess what?

266
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yep, you will naturally be by force of repetition.

267
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The same as burping and say or begin attaching negative associations to it.

268
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Until you're.

269
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That is so incredibly true.

270
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So now we're getting down to something.

271
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Some socios, psychological aspects of this that I hadn't really thought about before,

272
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
but believe me, I know where all this came from.

273
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I know where that negative association came from.

274
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It is from my parents.

275
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Practice is not a labor powerless from pointless repetition.

276
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But I just want to blame all the nasty shit people say about me.

277
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
All my parents don't mind.

278
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Actually disempowering as using the name of your spiritual practice,

279
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
starts to conjure up all the bad stuff in your work day or whatever with your

280
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
stubborn toe.

281
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Everything that hurts everything that's gone wrong with your life is associated to this

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
name.

283
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's so disempowering.

284
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Finally, words and names have power in and of themselves.

285
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Above and beyond any context associated with them.

286
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
In Buddhism, in the Sanskrit language, there's a concept of a seed syllable,

287
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
a sound that is so powerful that it has meaning, whether or not you understand it,

288
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
whether or not you believe in it.

289
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Invoking these sounds with intention, focus and power can have awesome effects.

290
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Invoking them have hazardly, but with lots of intention, like swearing, can also have

291
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
awesome effects, but they usually negative ones.

292
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Consider the sound, ah, it's the first son you make as a baby.

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's the sound you make as you fight for your life.

294
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's the sound you make at the peak of orgasm.

295
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Hold on.

296
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Is that the sound you make at peak of orgasm?

297
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Uh, dude.

298
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Not rolling out the snake for you.

299
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The last sound that passes your lips is the force of life fades from your body.

300
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's universal to all of us, and it's a noomestake that in alphabet.

301
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
A or A, if you French, is the first letter.

302
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's also no coincidence that most of our deities and powers use that sound in them.

303
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
God, Allah, Yahweh, Brahma, Kanon, Avalo, Katasura, Shiva.

304
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
In Arimek, Jesus Christ is Yeshua, which stems from the biblical Hebrew, Yahosua.

305
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Christ, of course, comes from Greek.

306
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
In his time, the role of the Messiah, the name of the Messiah, would have been pronounced to

307
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Mosjak.

308
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Taking power words and names and veins, again, sticking your finger in a wall socket.

309
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You're tapping into tremendous power that you have no idea how to channel properly.

310
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And as a result, you'll probably fry yourself.

311
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Not to mention caught off any chances you have for enlightenment or salvation.

312
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Whatever it is that is important to you.

313
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Respect is important, but at least from my point of view.

314
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
A prohibition against taking power words and flinging them around,

315
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
mostly has far more drastic consequences for you and for the people around you.

316
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So, some audio feedback from the financial aid podcast has nothing to do with financial aid.

317
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Check us out at financialadpodcast.com and thanks a lot Adam.

318
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
No man, thank you, I appreciate it.

319
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's interesting.

320
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
All those A words.

321
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Very cool.

322
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And something to think about.

323
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And there's some lessons in what you just said that I want to process,

324
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
but perhaps we can start making some other associations or using that power for good.

325
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
A names like Aerowana.

326
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The god I pray to you.

327
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Adam, I just was listening.

328
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
DSC number 362.

329
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And her manges answer to your golden ticket.

330
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I don't know if you noticed or if you did it on purpose,

331
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
but immediately after she makes the comment about what she's going to do for you,

332
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
then you have the earthling fairies come on and ask,

333
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
do you believe in anything's possible?

334
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's it.

335
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Can I clear up?

336
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Wanted to drop you a quick comment.

337
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah, you don't think that was intentional to you.

338
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Man, that stuff gets lined up in Cas Blaster and it's green to go.

339
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So yesterday we launched the first golden ticket.

340
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm going to tell you just briefly again what that is.

341
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We have this technology we've built called D-Gap.

342
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The dynamic generated asset placement,

343
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
which means we can put stuff into our podcast on the network,

344
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
which of course could be tags at the front of a podcast,

345
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
which is most of the ones that the network now have,

346
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
talking about GoDaddy.

347
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Or we can randomly insert them based upon odds,

348
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
where I think at a one to 25,000 ratio now on the golden ticket test.

349
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So that somewhere in the podcast,

350
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
in fact, I'm going to note the time down right now,

351
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
because if you're listening and the next words are congratulations,

352
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
then you won.

353
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Okay, I just want to write down that time code.

354
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
There we go.

355
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So if you didn't, if you just heard me writing something down,

356
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
then you lost, because we're going to do it again today.

357
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So here's how it works.

358
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I am taking that exact moment in the podcast.

359
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm going to add that into our D-Gap system.

360
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And one listener will receive a different daily source code,

361
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
which will have those actual words,

362
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
which will have a separate set of words inserted,

363
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
which I pre-recorded and is on the D-Gap server as well.

364
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Now, we've set the odds to 125,000.

365
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So that's your actual chance of pulling out the golden ticket.

366
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yesterday, we served the golden ticket.

367
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
We know kind of where the person was who received the ticket,

368
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
and we know that they were using a juice receiver to receive the ticket,

369
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
but they haven't checked in yet.

370
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So the thought mistake I made here is,

371
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
well, sometimes people are a day behind,

372
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
or maybe three days behind, or maybe they didn't listen at all.

373
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So obviously, when we roll out golden ticket promotions on a full scale,

374
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
we'll have to lower the odds a little bit,

375
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
or we'll have to figure something out.

376
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But it is kind of cool.

377
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It forces you to listen if you want to win.

378
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And boy, where there are lots of people trying to hack in

379
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and scam the system.

380
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
That was pretty amazing.

381
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I mean, feel free to do whatever you want to.

382
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It doesn't really matter.

383
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This is just a test.

384
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's not an official contest,

385
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
but I want to do it again today.

386
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I have two people who have a golden ticket.

387
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Remember, it's for that AV.

388
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Was it the Keystone?

389
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I hope it's the Keystone.

390
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Thing is the Keystone AV.

391
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
iPod.

392
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Doc and remote.

393
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Our F remote is what it is.

394
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a nice little Chatsky.

395
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's not the point.

396
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So there will be another one going out today.

397
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And so hopefully we'll hear from the new winner,

398
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
or from the previous winner, or perhaps from both.

399
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Of course, we'll be happy to shell out both prizes.

400
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But in the future.

401
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And by the way, it's very possible that it didn't work.

402
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's another thing that Andrew and I, Andrew Grumman,

403
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and I are taking into account that maybe it didn't get inserted

404
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
properly, although from everything we can see it did.

405
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
In the future, I think the way it will work is we'll have golden ticket

406
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
promotional weeks or weekends or whatever.

407
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And then any podcast you listen to on the pod show podcast.

408
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Now, we're could have the golden ticket inserted.

409
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And it could be multiple.

410
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So we're really working on this.

411
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And this again, this is why I like the daily source code.

412
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We can mess around and test stuff and try and break it.

413
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And so if you want to try and hack it again, that's okay.

414
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It doesn't matter.

415
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
If you hack it and you win, you win, right?

416
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But obviously we have a lot of strategies and ideas to make that

417
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
much more difficult.

418
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The whole concept of registered listeners will make that much easier,

419
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
obviously.

420
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So if you receive that golden ticket, you got the message.

421
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Make sure you do as instructed to claim your prize.

422
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And I'm looking forward to talking to one, or perhaps two winners.

423
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Are you ready or rock?

424
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
This is the story.

425
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm a rock and low, but let's rock.

426
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This is it.

427
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
My goal, but let's rock and roll geek show.

428
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000

429
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Cool.

So crank it up.

When you can listen to the future.

450
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Hi Adam.

451
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
This is Chris Future.

452
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
With the Think Future Radio Show.

453
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Happy to be the newest member of the Pot Show family.

454
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Thanks for taking me on.

455
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You know when I first started podcasting a year ago, I knew something was missing.

456
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Kick ass, take no prisoners political rant radio.

457
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Sure, there's probably a bit out there, but hardly any in the podcast world.

458
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This is one of the reasons I started a Think Future Radio Show.

459
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
What's it all about?

460
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Well, I'm a political commentator.

461
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm libertarians of both sides hate me equally.

462
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And I'm also into giving a voice and power and freedom to the people.

463
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
What else do I talk about?

464
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Well, pretty much every goddamn thing under the sun.

465
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Current events, politics, Hillary.

466
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's going to be the next president of the United States.

467
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Crazy ass drivers.

468
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I want to know what you're going to fucking do.

469
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Use your goddamn signal lights.

470
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
That's what they're there for.

471
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Stupid people.

472
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Fucking spits in home depot.

473
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Or even how to cook a perfect turkey.

474
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Blining.

475
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You never know what you're going to get.

476
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Every weekday, I'm a Think Future Radio Show.

477
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Now, part of the Pot Show network.

478
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Thanks again, Adam.

479
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
No, Chris.

480
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Thank you.

481
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Welcome to La Familia, my friend.

482
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And nice meeting you the other day at the Pot Show HQ.

483
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
If you're checking us out on Serious Stars 102,

484
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
don't forget to listen to Digital Flotsom tonight at 9 o'clock.

485
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Mr. and PCH is next.

486
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
We'll be back here tomorrow with a thank God.

487
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's Friday edition.

488
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Oh, the show.

489
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Shit couldn't fit that one in.

490
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Sorry about it.

491
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I didn't have time to play my satellite repair managing.

492
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh, I love hearing it so much.

493
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
By the way, if you.

494
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Peter.

495
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
What is going on outside?

496
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Oh, that's inside.

497
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm sorry.

498
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It's this cleaning of the cottage day.

499
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Peter abused his own go daddy code to the set-up satellite repairman.com.

500
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
That's real easy to remember isn't I don't know how you spell satellite.

501
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
S-A-T-E-L-L-I-T-E.

502
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Satellite repairman.com will take you to digitalflotsom.org.

503
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Something just.

504
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Man, that is a lot of noise isn't it?

505
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I hate that.

506
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Something else I was going to say.

507
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Okay, I don't remember.

508
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It is really time for vacation, my friends.

509
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Hi, Adam Curry.

510
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

511
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
We can't just start them off like that.

512
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm so sorry, CSB.

513
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Comic strip.

514
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Comic strip.

515
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Comic strip.

516
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Comic strip.

517
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Comic strip.

518
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Comic strip.

519
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Comic strip.

520
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Comic strip.

521
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Comic strip.

522
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Hi, Adam Curry.

523
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Enter the middle of April.

524
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It means until the 50s April.

525
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I will not be sending to you any more audio comments.

526
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And by then, I will not be posting any comments on your blog.

527
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You are going to holiday to beautiful Portugal, so you deserve some tranquility.

528
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Speaking of Portugal, I would be grateful if you could plaque this message to Netherlands

529
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
because the time of decision is right now, exactly now.

530
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Dear Netherlands, please take example from Portugal and some other EU countries

531
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
and open yourself for new EU citizens from Eastern Europe.

532
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
This will be good also for economy of Netherlands.

533
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Please, with sugar and marshmallows on top.

534
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So, Adam Curry have a nice holiday and don't do any podcasts or video casts while on holiday.

535
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Enjoy your gals, some other gals, enjoy the sea and just take time off without podcasting.

536
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Bye.

537
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Oh, comic strip blogger.

538
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That's so nice of you.

539
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Man, what's happening?

540
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You know, the CSB has really got, you know, he really knows what's going on in the European Union.

541
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I do like it when he sends me something that's useful in that regard because there is a lot of weird stuff going on.

542
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You know, if you compare the EU, the European Union to the United States,

543
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,000
which of course was the entire idea to create one monetary unit to create a single union.

544
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
There's all these problems at the local level.

545
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I mean, just imagine that, you know, you could not go from one state to the next state

546
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
or from New York to Connecticut.

547
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yeah, you could go there to visit, but you couldn't actually work there.

548
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You know, there's all kinds of things that are happening.

549
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And comic strip blogger really is on top of it.

550
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So, appreciate it.

551
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I am taking along some equipment, not a full mobile set.

552
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I'll take along cast blaster and the wireless love mic just in case,

553
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
well, this case is something that we want to do.

554
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And of course, I'm taking along my video camera for, you know, our own vacation stuff and pictures, etc.

555
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So, I'm sure that, you know, in the 10 days there's no way I can stay offline.

556
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And, you know, I have to get online at least once a day to empty out my freaking Gmail.

557
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
God damn, you know, they're coming out with that, with that corporate Gmail,

558
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
where you can use your own domain name, etc.

559
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm hoping, what it comes with now comes standard with two gigs per account.

560
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm hoping that since it is a corporate service, that's,

561
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
God, what is that noise?

562
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's pissing me off.

563
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Soundproof the studio now?

564
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm hoping that I'll be able to buy more space when that becomes fully available.

565
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I've signed up for the day-to-now and,

566
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
God, that is so annoying isn't it?

567
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It's really distracting me.

568
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Okay, so going on vacation won't be doing podcasts.

569
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yesterday, a great idea was thrown up,

570
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
it was thrown into the discussion about the box,

571
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
B.O.C.S. Bravo Oscar Charlie.

572
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
In other words, the best of Charlie.

573
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Hey Adam, it's listener Jim again.

574
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Hey, I just got back in Hong Kong from a couple days in China.

575
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It's now 1230 in the morning on Thursday,

576
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and caught up on the Charlie 361 and part of 362.

577
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I'm glad to hear that you played my comment about the box,

578
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and I'm really excited about Ellie's proposal to have the listeners generate that,

579
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I think it's a great idea.

580
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm not a position to start creating any podcasts yet.

581
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I haven't even got my own off the ground.

582
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But I do have some ideas that some of the other podcasters

583
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
that listeners out there might want to take and run with.

584
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
One would be a show dedicated to FAQ.

585
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Another would be a show dedicated to the birth of Trinity,

586
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and I think a couple of the funniest ones could be shows dedicated to feedback

587
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
from Madge or even better yet feedback from comic strip blogger.

588
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Anyway, there's a few ideas.

589
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Again, have a great vacation.

590
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Look forward to hearing what your listeners come up with.

591
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I think it will do make great shows.

592
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Well, Julie soon.

593
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Let me tell you, man, that already I've received three

594
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
of Bravo Oscar Charlie's.

595
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Three of them this morning.

596
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Just since that one thing, that one comment,

597
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
the one discussion we had yesterday,

598
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I really, I can't tell you how blown away I am by that.

599
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And how much I appreciated.

600
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So I need four more, and anyone who sends that in,

601
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'll make sure you get a nice bag of podshow,

602
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
swag, t-shirts, and crap, and what have you.

603
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Sam Levin will put some crap together.

604
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It'll be nice and that you'll enjoy.

605
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And I really, really appreciate the whole thought.

606
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Great idea.

607
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And it's unfortunate that we don't have the full PDN up in rolling,

608
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
because you can put shows up for delivery at a certain day,

609
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
or a certain time.

610
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So I'm going to preload all those,

611
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
but it really would be before the launch.

612
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So we have to figure out some way to be posting those shows,

613
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
while I'm, excuse me, I'm not even drinking a sense say,

614
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
oh, I don't know with, oh, heartburn, gastronomic issues.

615
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
But yeah, we got, we got some great, great shows,

616
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and it's just blown me away.

617
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Hey Adam, Jim again.

618
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
One more show idea that you've got to include

619
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
is a show dedicated to Roger Small.

620
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Maybe even Roger could host that show.

621
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Boy, that would be great to hear him talking about his own comments.

622
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And what was going on in his mind when he actually made the calls to you.

623
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Yeah, really.

624
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Anyway, this whole idea of listener generated shows gave me

625
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
one more thing to think about.

626
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You've already admitted that 70% of your show

627
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
or more comes from listener generated input.

628
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Well, if you now have listeners that are editing and preparing your shows,

629
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
you may just be able to quit your quit your day job job.

630
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Imagine that sitting around getting paid

631
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
for preparing shows that you don't prepare

632
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
with content that you don't make.

633
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Boy, now that's my idea of hitting a lot of.

634
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Take care.

635
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Talk to you soon.

636
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I love that.

637
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
That would be, now, when we get to that point,

638
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
that's when I can just slowly fade to black.

639
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Wouldn't that be nice?

640
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Great idea, man.

641
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Love it.

642
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Take the dudes and do debts, but dudes.

643
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Have you seen the most recent soccer girl video?

644
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You know, the soccer girl, of course,

645
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
part of the podcast network.

646
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And she's also a part of the one message,

647
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
one brand many voices campaign for Go Daddy.

648
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Just around you, the end of her most recent video.

649
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
She has a very interesting way of,

650
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
remember now, what we're doing here is we're leaving all of the creative

651
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
advertising up to the podcasts as themselves,

652
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
because only they know how to communicate with their audience.

653
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And soccer girl definitely is onto what her audience wants.

654
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I suggest you take a look at it.

655
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's certainly not family or kids safe, but very, very funny.

656
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And by the way, soccer girl, I think I'd like to rent that space

657
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
myself in the near future.

658
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I think it's very, very valuable.

659
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And I just want, I wrote this down.

660
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I wanted to talk to about this for a couple of days now,

661
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
because I guess it's kind of subsided in the world press,

662
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
but there's still a lot of crap going on in France.

663
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And there's a lot of riots and burnings of cars,

664
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and people getting beaten into the hospital.

665
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And I just wanted to tell you what this was about,

666
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
because I find it fascinating.

667
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
There was a law that was proposed.

668
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Now, I'm not sure, I'm sure comics are blogger.

669
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
We'll put in the comments the exact details.

670
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
From what I understand, the government, either wanted to

671
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
or pass the law that made the hiring,

672
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
but particularly the firing of employees much easier.

673
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And much easier for young people to get fired.

674
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Now, that, of course, is the way it's being portrayed,

675
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
but really what it is.

676
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The relaxation on the employment rules.

677
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Now, in the United States certainly,

678
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and I believe in the United Kingdom,

679
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
the fire at any moment for pretty much any reason.

680
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I think this is a good thing.

681
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And this is a totally an American viewpoint,

682
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
but this is coming from an entrepreneur

683
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
who is also set up companies in other countries.

684
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
The Netherlands is one.

685
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And in the Netherlands, when you're hired,

686
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
a couple of things happen.

687
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
First of all, guaranteed benefits, which is great.

688
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
You don't get that in many other countries.

689
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You don't get that necessarily in the United States.

690
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
By the way, at Pod Show, you do.

691
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And I must say, many of our podcasters also receive similar benefits.

692
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
That you get right off the bat.

693
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Then you get something called the 13th month,

694
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
which is automatic, which means as an employer,

695
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
you have to pay all of your employees an extra month salary.

696
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Not for working just because that's the law.

697
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And then you have vacation money.

698
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And you can't fire anyone.

699
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Even with just cause, you have to buy them out.

700
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And usually, there's a whole formula for it,

701
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
but you have to take them to court, and it's very, very difficult.

702
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But what this breeds is laziness.

703
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And I have seen this in every single one of my companies.

704
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Because once people are in, they're like, OK.

705
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I got a job.

706
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Now, I'm set.

707
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You know, they come in at five after nine.

708
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
They have the code on at five minutes to five.

709
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You know, they, oh, I don't feel good today.

710
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'll just stay home.

711
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Very, very, very difficult to operate a business.

712
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And if someone just isn't working out.

713
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I'm sorry.

714
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You have to leave.

715
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Now, of course, what happens is you can hire people on a short-term contract basis.

716
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And this is the really bad thing.

717
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
His company's hire young people for a two or three month contract.

718
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And then they, they say, OK, let's get into your contract.

719
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I think you can do it twice.

720
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
So in total, maybe for six months.

721
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
But it's a horrible, horrible system.

722
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Now, the contrarian view, of course, as Europeans will often say, or say,

723
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
they've said to me, well, yeah, but you know, you use this fear.

724
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And everyone's afraid of getting fired.

725
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And I was, you know, never in my life have I ever threatened or had to threaten anyone

726
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
with being fired.

727
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
In fact, I think you'll find in the US that it's,

728
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
it's so cultural that it's not fear.

729
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's just people want to do a good job.

730
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You know, and they put in the work because they're excited about it.

731
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Now, there's also lots of incentives at Pod Show.

732
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
There's, you know, there's stock incentives and ownership of the company and, you know,

733
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
all kinds of things that we do.

734
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But now, here are these kids that are rioting in France because they are not

735
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
being given the security that they expect from a welfare state.

736
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The very careful United States have ever tried to integrate this.

737
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I mean, I'm all from medical benefits, and I wish we could figure that out.

738
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And, you know, on a company by company basis, it's either good or bad, essentially.

739
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But wow, I can't believe that this is what they're fighting about, you know,

740
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
instead of going out and getting a fucking job, you know, or work, you know, trying to get a job.

741
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You know, no, we're just going to go riot because it's not what we deserve.

742
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And this is this whole welfare state, man.

743
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's like, I hear people in Europe all the time talk about what they feel they deserve.

744
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And, you know, this happened and I deserve compensation.

745
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
So France gets your act together.

746
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
People of France, I just say, please get your act together.

747
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Just, you know, find, do something more productive than this.

748
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Okay.

749
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I don't know if that came out right, but I think you kind of understand what I'm talking about.

750
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Hey, a couple more things before we wrap it up for today.

751
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Hi, Adam, this is Peter from Internet Communicators.

752
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And I like to comment on something you were talking about in 3601,

753
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
the Charlie 3601 about part two mob and the way that they tried to get to put

754
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
advertising stuff in front of your podcast.

755
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
We at Internet Communicators developed a portal,

756
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
site called part promo station.

757
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You can find that part promo station dot com where you can find

758
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
podcasts where you can listen to podcasts where you can see some sort of a visual

759
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
that belongs to that podcast where you can download the podcast where you can subscribe

760
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
or you can see websites anything.

761
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And we are seriously thinking about putting ads on that website.

762
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Visual ads, not audio ads, visual ads like banner stuff like that.

763
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And, well, you know, I don't see that much of a difference between ads on a website

764
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
and yes, that are in front of a mobile service like the part two mob guys did.

765
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So I like to have your opinion on that because I don't want to get sued by the

766
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
part father himself.

767
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Never.

768
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I don't think that's a very good idea.

769
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I don't have that much money.

770
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I can tell you that.

771
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Okay, thank you for your time and I'm looking forward to your comment on our

772
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
comment and I hope to speak to you later.

773
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Goodbye.

774
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Well, okay, that's very, and there's quite a healthy

775
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
conversation going on about this.

776
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I think the easiest way to test your theory is why don't you take

777
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
a podcast from a mainstream media company.

778
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So take one from clear channel has lots of the audio podcast and you could probably

779
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
get one from NPR and why don't you start putting ads in front of that.

780
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And then see what and then let them know that you're doing it and give them your

781
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
theory and then see what happens.

782
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Because it ain't going to work that way.

783
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Wait, I have another comment about this.

784
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Hello Adam, this is Kevin from Coloring Outside the Lines.

785
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Then I have a serious issue with Pod to mom.

786
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
The issue is not monetary.

787
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It's with associations.

788
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I am very careful as a professional body painter of what gets associated with my artwork.

789
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I just want to say that all that crackling noise that's his recording, not my, not my set up.

790
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So kind of listen through it because it's worth it.

791
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And I am also consider it to those people who would like to have ads in my

792
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
show.

793
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
The reason why is because of the nature of my work.

794
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Associations can be very detrimental.

795
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I really don't like the idea that a company could take an ad.

796
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Let's say adult websites porn.

797
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And put it in front of my show.

798
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I really don't like that.

799
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Now I'm not saying that Pod to mom is going to start selling porn.

800
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But I don't like the idea that they could.

801
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Now let's look at it at the bigger picture.

802
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And this is what happens if let's say a casino starts running ads.

803
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So these godcasters now have their shows sandwiched in between casinos.

804
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Or let's say we find out that there's a company that screws you over in the past and now you're advertising for them.

805
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I don't think I would like that at all.

806
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Now I've seen some comments saying that well what's the difference between that and like the podcast pickle and podcast alley.

807
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
They have ads.

808
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:58,000
The difference is that there is a distinct difference in mediums.

809
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:07,000
The problem I have with Pod to mom is that they're using the same medium to do their advertisements.

810
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So it makes it almost indistinguishable.

811
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Now for those people who are starting to wonder exactly why am I concerned about this and

812
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
after all associations are no big deal.

813
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I only have one thing to say.

814
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I haven't even heard that way.

815
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Okay.

816
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Okay.

817
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Thank you.

818
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It worked.

819
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Okay.

820
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Let's talk about Pod to mom for a second.

821
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So there's a couple of different things.

822
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
First of all, anything that you create anybody anywhere, whether you just write something

823
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
down on a piece of paper or whether you record something automatically that is your copyrighted work.

824
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
You don't have to register that.

825
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
You don't have to do anything more.

826
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It's your work and it's copyrighted and that is pretty much the law everywhere as far as I know.

827
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:08,000
The use of your work falls under whatever copyright you choose to give use choose to put on it.

828
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So basically no one can use that work without express permission.

829
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Things like creative comments have made it very easy so that instead of, you know, people having to contact the originator of a work continuously to find out what can I do with this, what you will allow me to do with this.

830
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
The creative comments licenses really say, okay, here's what you're allowed to do.

831
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
For instance, I would deem this this podcast.

832
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Licenseable under the creative comments copyright attribution non-commercial share like, which means you have to share it the same way.

833
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You have to credit where it comes from and you can't use it in any commercial venture.

834
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
That is very different from a directory link.

835
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:56,000
By the way, I have to say that using a shows picture as a directory link.

836
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Actually, I guess you should ask for permission to use that, which brings up an interesting point a lot of people have mentioned about the podshow.com directory listings.

837
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,000
We're definitely changing that. We went through this whole thing with Jason Calcanas before and we've, we've now put in the website links.

838
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
But within two weeks, it's all going to change and there will be no huge ads next to the listing.

839
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
So, you know, that's, we're not trying to make anything look like ours.

840
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Really, we're just focusing on a whole bunch of other stuff and, you know, the only thing we could do is pull it all down.

841
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
But it's now, you know, in the middle of an integration with podcast alley.

842
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So apologies for people who don't like that.

843
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,000
The whole thing has been discussed and in open form, just look for the blog post from Jason Calcanas and myself about that.

844
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So we are changing that because I don't think that's exactly right either. That placement is not proper.

845
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:57,000
But we could actually have the discussion where if you are, if you've not expressly submitted your podcast to the podcast alley directory to podshow that we shouldn't be able to use your logo, that would make sense.

846
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It would be a shame, obviously, because it's all it is for promotional purposes.

847
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It's like the phone book, you know, we're trying to get people to make it easy to find stuff.

848
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So directories is pretty much inherent to the internet. Now, when it comes to taking, I'll just use my podcast in this example.

849
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Taking that and presenting that to anyone in any way shape or form where it could be deemed confusing.

850
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And the law does have an alloyer, but the law does have some very specific jurisprudence about consumer or customer or user confusion.

851
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,000
If it seems like the ads are a part of a podcast, then there's definitely a case.

852
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Now, specifically with pod to mob, let me just backtrack a little bit.

853
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So they have been around for a while, and they've, you know, either sucked out other directories, which is perfectly cool.

854
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You know, we make our directories available, certainly, any part of that org to take that, that opium l file, the listing and use that anywhere you want.

855
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Because that's good. It's distribution for everybody. I totally agree with it. I think it's great that you are able to receive podcasts on your cell phone.

856
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Now, when I checked out the service, you know, the first thing I heard was this podcast is brought to you by and then there was a ringtone company.

857
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And then my show started with our own ad insertion or tag insertion of go daddy. That's a violation of the copyright because it's confusing consumers.

858
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Now, after, and by the way, I never submitted anything to their directorie, you know, the guys from pod to mob are very, very vague.

859
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And since we've started this whole brewha, they have changed what they're doing, for instance.

860
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So my show has been removed from the directory entirely upon my request, by the way.

861
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,000
But Don and Drew is an example of still in there. Now, what has changed is pod to mob is no longer serving ads. Here's what they're doing.

862
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Let me see if I can make this work. It's coming from from a different computer that I've passed into the board.

863
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And it's streaming, of course.

864
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:10,000
The podcast you requested is being brought to you by pod to mob.com. Please tell your friends. They don't need an iPod to listen to podcasts.

865
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Thank you very much, and now here's your podcast.

866
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
See how that I like. I really don't have a problem with that.

867
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I'm okay. I think they still should ask me for the permission to do that. Now, in fact, I demand they asked for permission to do that.

868
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
But I would say, yeah, that's okay. You can do that, but you can't go inserting ads.

869
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Now, let me say something about pod to mob. So I've discussed this on the show.

870
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
We've had there's been many postings about it.

871
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And I've sent several emails I've had Brian Longer, start director of operations, call them. They're not getting back to me at all.

872
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And I think that these guys are a bunch of quite honestly shady characters from LA who are in the ringtone business.

873
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And they're in the ringtone business, or being in the ringtone business makes them very knowledgeable about how to get stuff, you know,

874
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:09,000
little applications on to cell phones. So, you know, they have all the right knowledge, but I think they have the wrong business acumen.

875
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,000
And they're not being very apologetic at all. They're trying to defend their business model.

876
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And what I'm getting, and this is the most interesting thing. I'm getting emails and comments from everywhere saying,

877
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Oh, go sue them. Go sue them. Take them out. No, you know what? We're not going to do that.

878
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Go take care of yourselves. I'm going to take care of our shows and make sure that we're protected because I don't want any more fights with people.

879
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I don't want fights legal fights with these guys.

880
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And there could be more on the horizon because ringtone guys are doing really nasty shit.

881
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
As an example, Jeff Smith, who makes all those wonderful jingles like...

882
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
This is popping up on ringtone websites all over the internet.

883
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Without any permission to do so, no relationship to the creative of the work Jeff Smith and even worse.

884
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
They're putting a different owner, author name, onto this ringtone.

885
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And I'll tell you why. The ringtone business is a part of the big record industry, the RIA.

886
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And when you sell a ringtone, a portion of that sale goes to the author composer, the owner of the rights, basically, of that ringtone.

887
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So what they're doing is they're stealing this ringtone and several others of Jeff's, by the way, putting it up for sale.

888
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And then, first they take the sale amount, the transaction, and then on the back end, they get it, they get money paid from AskCat,

889
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
BMI for the distribution. And this is something that we really need to go after.

890
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I mean, these guys are chisters. So I can only think that if you've got pod to mob, who are kind of in that ringtone business,

891
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
that they do not have podcasters best intentions at heart.

892
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Unless they prove otherwise, which would be really nice if they responded in a proper manner, either privately through email,

893
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,000
by picking up the phone and calling the numbers we left for them, or by really getting into the conversation.

894
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
So far, I've seen nothing but hogwash, and I do not trust these guys.

895
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And now, one last song for y'all, from the pod save music network.

896
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:35,000
If you've got a grandma, you may appreciate this song.

897
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Or if you are a grandma, listen to this Charlie.

898
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I'm almost turning I need to.

899
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:51,000
And that's a lot of years ahead of you.

900
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:58,000
So listen close to what I say.

901
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,000
This grandma's feeling old today.

902
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:11,000
She said I can't believe I'm sitting here, old as I am.

903
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I've never been stoned.

904
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I waited too long to bring it all.

905
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Grandma's going to fly.

906
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:41,000
So rolled it up and passed it around.

907
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Grandma smoked the whole thing down.

908
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Said she was making love for wasted ground.

909
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,000
She's too many times, she turned it down.

910
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
She said you live your life until it's gone.

911
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,000
The things you never tried, just slip away.

912
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
So they're gone too.

913
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I waited too long to bring it all.

914
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Grandma's going to fly.

915
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And as you talk about the old days,

916
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Said some things I blew my mind.

917
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Because you ain't seen a thing.

918
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Do you see Grandma getting high?

919
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Now grandma's she didn't have much time left.

920
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
She made use of every breath.

921
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:25,000
And swear she smiled before she left.

922
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I felt the world fall off her chest.

923
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And there's a gate to tell and open wide.

924
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
She slipped over to the other side.

925
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:54,000
She was saying, I waited too long to bring it all.

926
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Grandma's going to fly.

927
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I waited too long to bring it all.

928
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Grandma's going to fly.

929
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,000
From the pod safe music network.

930
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
