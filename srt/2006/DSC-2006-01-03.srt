1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,480
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,160
radio content in my ears.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This year at Charlie 3-0-A Tuesday y'all, it's wake up the neighborhood.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hey, boom, that is completely clear.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Whoa, yeah.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What the hell is nonsense?

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What the hell is nonsense?

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Striggling things like innocence, running away to take.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
With my mind in it's hands shut, got just me walking away.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Doesn't it get in there?

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But to come after the rain.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Whoa, yeah.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Whoa.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Whoa.

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Whoa.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Whoa.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Whoa.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Whoa.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Whoa.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Whoa.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Whoa.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Whoa.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Whoa.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Whoa.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Whoa.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Whoa.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Whoa.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Whoa.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Whoa.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Whoa.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Whoa.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Whoa.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Whoa.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Whoa.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Whoa.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Whoa.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Whoa.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Whoa.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Whoa.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Whoa.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Whoa.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Whoa.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Whoa.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Whoa.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Whoa.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Whoa.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Whoa.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Whoa.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Whoa.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Whoa.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Whoa.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Whoa.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Sau.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mmm.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Sau.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I can't forget you

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't deserve a castle

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't blame my own

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm a thief, I don't deserve a castle

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But it's set this morning

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Sometimes it's just easy

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Walk away from the night

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Some people get tired, it's cold

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And it's part of your forced life

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Woo

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Woo

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Woo

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Woo

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Woo

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I won't forget you

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I won't stop

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If I had an ounce of musical talent

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is the kind of sound I would make

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Man, love that

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Scorded on the Pods Abusing Network

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Just about 15 minutes ago

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It showed up on the homepage

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
1234

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
From Ontario, Canada

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I won't forget you

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's Tuesday, thanks again for

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Checking out the show

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The big show

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's a weather like today

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's kind of dreary

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's about 7 degrees

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Celsius

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
An Christina started school again today

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So it was up early

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Crackadon almost

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Or at least it felt like that

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Neither of the girls

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Neither Patricia

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Christina slept very well

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I slept like a fucking rock

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Beautiful

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And 730, I was ready to go

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So I've been going through email

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Didn't do, you know, kind of skipped

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Through a few things over the weekend

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Just to lighten the load a bit

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And of course I had to pay for that today

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And hit 99% on the Gmail

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
My special nerdy

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Alotment of four gigs is now officially filled up

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So I went in to lead it about a hundred megs

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Worth of stuff

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Which hurts me so much

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But I guess I'm just going to have to

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Start

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Asking Google again

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
They can up my Gmail

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And I'd gladly pay for it

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let me reiterate

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I gladly pay for it

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I love it

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I love having huge mountains of data

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Just stored somewhere

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Where I can get to it

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
With your fabulous searching

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Technology

125
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's see

126
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
On today's show

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We're going to do a

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, I almost forgot to line up

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The Metrosexual moment

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay, I'll do that in a second

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We have a short

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We're actually

133
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Enough stuff has come in

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
For another Metrosexual moment

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Item

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
In the Daily Source code

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
See what I do

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm noticing more video podcasts coming online

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Which vlogging now seems to be the word of choice

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't know yet if I want to support that word

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Because it's just vlogging

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Although I saw a Dutch guy vlogging

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And he had a whole bunch of Dutch people

144
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Including his dad who looked about 80

145
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
On camera saying

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You mother vloggers

147
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I did like that

148
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So the word definitely is

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Moldable into something at least entertaining

150
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But there's a lot happening

151
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And I see a lot of talking heads

152
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But I also see a lot of beautifully

153
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Produce stuff

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And I think it's actually pretty exciting

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I have to say the ratio of vlogs

156
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Vlogs to podcasts

157
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
For me right now

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm probably about

159
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
35% vlogs

160
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That I'm

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Perusing on a daily basis

162
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So yeah, it's cropping up there

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I guess what I'm going to have to do

164
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Is create a channel or something like that

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
With everything that I watch

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The real problem here is just the tools

167
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We're not done with the tools

168
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yet certainly not for

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Routing stuff around

170
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's the one thing that I loved about

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Web-based aggregators

172
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Certainly the one in radio

173
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Userland is you could go through

174
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
A list of stories that came in on your RSS aggregator

175
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And then you could literally just click

176
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
A button next to a story

177
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And it would take that story

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And it would post it onto your weblog

179
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And it would actually open up your weblog

180
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
For editing with that story

181
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Already pre-populated it would do like the

182
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Referring link where you got it from

183
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're the via whatever thing

184
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It really cool

185
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And I think we should have the same

186
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Capability for podcasts

187
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But of course it has to be a lot simpler

188
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Because what people will do now

189
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You've got stuff downloading

190
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You've got megs of stuff all over the place

191
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So somehow just using the original URLs

192
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Which should be able to

193
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Create channels to repost

194
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Which in my mind is very simple

195
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And it's just a matter of implementation

196
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But no to self that we do that

197
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And what is it with the RIA?

198
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And little girls

199
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This is becoming quite concerning

200
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Whole court case that was sent to me by

201
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hassan Dewan

202
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Hassan said I thought you'd probably like this

203
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This was essentially a court case

204
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Trying to think

205
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll have to put a link into the

206
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Show notes page so you can go and look at this whole thing

207
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But basically

208
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I guess a case was dropped because the RIA coerced a witness

209
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And some of the questions

210
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Let me see so that's some cross examination here

211
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Let me just read this to you

212
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Motown versus Nelson

213
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's the case pending in federal court in court here in Michigan

214
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Eastern division

215
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Defendants Mr. and Mrs. Nelson

216
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I've made a motion for attorneys fees against the RIA attorney

217
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This fees against the RIA attorneys

218
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Pursue and blah blah blah

219
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Law foreign reasonable and

220
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Vexatious litigation and properly interfering

221
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Enduro obtaining false testimony from

222
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Perspective witness

223
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So here's part of the

224
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I guess what is it cross examination

225
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Question what are the areas do you feel that

226
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Mr. Kerch and bomb that would be the RIA lawyer

227
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Put words into your mouth answer

228
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't remember any specifically just trying to get me to say that

229
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Angie and Jim or I had rips him

230
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Ripped him music off

231
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Question it wasn't true and so you felt

232
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Mr. Kerch bomb was trying to get you to say something

233
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It wasn't true answer yes

234
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Question did he get you to say something that wasn't true

235
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
A from the statement I read yes

236
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And this goes on and on and on

237
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Uh, oh here we go

238
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Did he tell you why he needed you to stick with your original false story

239
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Answer because he said he didn't have a case unless I did

240
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Question so he told you that he didn't have a case unless you stuck to the original

241
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Fall story answer yes

242
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Now this was actually a 15 year old girl

243
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
who went through this

244
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
This alleged grilling by the RIA which actually

245
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And this and Hassan

246
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Link to whole bunch of information about it

247
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Could actually be seen as illegal

248
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Racketeering even

249
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
15 year old girls

250
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You know this whole thing with this settlement centers

251
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
They have you know if they if they quote catchy

252
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Sharing music or distributing music online

253
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Then you don't get a call from a lawyer per se

254
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But from the settlement center

255
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And they'll say okay you pay us 30 grand

256
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And then we'll make everything go away

257
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You know they have like whole process for this thing

258
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And

259
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We talked about

260
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Music stores

261
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
At least according to the BBC music stores

262
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And therefore I presume it's in the UK

263
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Only for now

264
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Have to pay a royalty

265
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
To ask at BMI or equivalent in country of origin

266
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Uh, for

267
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
For people actually performing music

268
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Testing out the instruments before purchasing

269
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We have a great audio comment

270
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Uh, that was sent in from

271
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Uh, I was at Darrell

272
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Before I get to that though

273
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Listen to this

274
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're gonna love this

275
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh, I got to open up this link

276
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Uh, this is a Fridrico Avers

277
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Sent this to me

278
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Uh, and this is from 1996

279
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But it turns out

280
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That in the summer of 96

281
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And this is according to this article that I'm reading from

282
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The American Society of Composes authors and publishers ask cap

283
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Has informed girls scout camps

284
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Nationwide

285
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They must pay license fees to use any of the

286
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Formally and copyrighted songs written or published by

287
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Ask cap 68,000 members

288
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Those who sing or play but don't pay

289
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Ask cap warns

290
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Might be violating the law

291
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Like restaurants hotels bar stores and clubs

292
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Which already pay fees to use copyrighted

293
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Music camps including non-profit ones

294
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Such as those run by the girls

295
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Scouts are being told to anti-up

296
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The demand covers not only recorded music

297
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But also songs from around the campfire

298
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Um, here's a quote

299
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
They buy paper, twine, and glue for their crafts

300
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They can pay for their music too

301
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Says John Loe Fremento

302
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Ask cap's chief operating officer

303
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If offenders keep singing without paying

304
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He says we will sue them if necessary

305
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Hey Barbara

306
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You're allowed to say something

307
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Okay

308
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm sorry

309
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Wait, I'm still drinking that

310
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Thank you

311
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Good day

312
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay

313
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
My disruption

314
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So if this is a true article

315
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And it's

316
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Apparently by Lisa Bannon from the

317
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Star Tribune, 1996

318
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I guess that happened

319
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Maybe it just probably just passes by

320
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And we weren't paying attention to it

321
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But man, that's, that means so

322
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Coercing 15 year girls into making statements

323
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Girl Scouts, I'm kind of Girl Scouts

324
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Money for singing songs around the campfire

325
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What is the world coming to?

326
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Hey Adam, this is Darrell Fallon at lawschoolpodcast.com

327
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Of course I do my podcast about my tending law school

328
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So first I want to say that I'm not a lawyer

329
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And this is just my opinion

330
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
As any individuals opinion would be worth

331
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So you can take it for that

332
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But this is about royalties for playing music

333
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And a business that sells musical instruments

334
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Or a place that sells musical instruments

335
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't think they would be charge royalties

336
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And this is why

337
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Under Title 17 in the United States Code

338
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Section 110 limitations on exclusive rights

339
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And the exemptions of certain performances in this place

340
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Subsection for a performance of a non-dramatic literary

341
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
A musical work in a transmission to the public

342
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial

343
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And without payment of any fee or other compensation

344
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
For the performance to any of its performers, promoters or organizers

345
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If there is no direct or indirect admission charge

346
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I think that covers it

347
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There is kind of a seminal case out there

348
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Which is fourth floor music ink

349
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Versus their place

350
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This basically set out the four things that you need it to establish

351
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And infringement number one

352
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The originality and authorship of the compositions involved

353
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Number two compliance with all formalities

354
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Or required to secure a copyright under Title 17

355
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Of the United States Code

356
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Number three that they are the proprietors of the copyrights

357
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Of the compositions involved in this action

358
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Number four that the compositions perform publicly for profit

359
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And number five that defend and not receive permission

360
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
From any of the claimants or the representatives for such performance

361
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So under number four you can see that the compositions perform publicly for profit

362
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
In a store that's probably not the case

363
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And I'm trying to go for a minute's this time

364
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But thanks a lot and hey everyone come visit law school podcast.com

365
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Talk to you later

366
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But I'm Darrell

367
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Thank you very much Darrell always checks in

368
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
He's not a lawyer yet

369
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But one day he'll be one

370
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So interesting

371
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I think of course that applies to the US as you were reading out US code

372
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So this may only be for the UK

373
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If anyone works in a music store in the UK

374
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Let me know if that's true if you actually do have to pay

375
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
For pay for people to play the instruments

376
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And of course you could argue that that playing is for profit

377
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Because if someone actually plays the instruments and they might purchase it

378
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And then there might be a profit and of course there's not the customer paying

379
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Although at least not directly indirectly the customer pays

380
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's the store that's paying

381
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But wouldn't that be interesting to find out if that's really going on

382
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Every single day there's a little piece of all this licensing business

383
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's being uncovered that just really blows me away

384
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And I think we should just pay attention to all of it

385
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So that whatever we do with Podsake music

386
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Let's try not to make the same mistakes

387
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm commander Scott Leo is the unified defense force

388
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm going to so describe information technologies

389
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I dig for old data on ancient reflective radio waves

390
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I've theorized and I may be able to use our contact rise

391
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The pulse wave and more in the people of earth

392
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Of a continuing threat that aren't that

393
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
If you're hearing any of this before the year 2009

394
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
There may be hope

395
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't have time to explain everything

396
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But the important thing is that if you are hearing this

397
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They will be coming back

398
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Point your podcatcher to children of the gods.net

399
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And find out how to reshape this tree

400
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
This could mean

401
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That's a donation

402
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
No, it's a donation

403
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But that's right

404
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There's a little time, please

405
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Help us with God's podcats

406
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000

Richard Cache

420
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Dr. Cache, the country was well

421
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That happened by coincidence

422
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They had the 2600 first frequently met

423
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Phone free game

424
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No, don't take care of you around that machine

425
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And just put your hair in phone numbers

426
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So some people from around the country

427
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Could call such a number for free

428
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And talk to each other for hours

429
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
www.phonetricks.com

430
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You can almost, you can almost make that claim

431
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I definitely, I'll give you that

432
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'll give you that year the first podcast

435
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Hello and welcome to another episode of TechX

436
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This is Jay Marti

437
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
God, I can't even do an honest show

438
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Without getting these help desk issues

439
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Let's see what's going on here

440
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay, we got one

441
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
My computer slash keyboard motherboard

442
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
CPU isn't is beeping at me

443
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Please come and help me

444
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
He's another one

445
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
My keyboard's not working

446
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
There's some liquids stuff on it

447
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't know what this is

448
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
All I had was coffee this morning

449
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Uh-huh

450
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Here's a third one

451
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
My mother CPU board is out of order

452
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Saying something about please insert a disk

453
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
All I have is a floppy

454
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Please assist

455
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Let me get on over to their computers

456
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Magicly make it all better

457
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Does this sound like you?

458
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Are you an admin or IT pro in your organization

459
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And this is what you get day in day out

460
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Or maybe you're not an admin

461
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Maybe you're just tech savvy

462
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And this is what your family and friends come to you with day in day out

463
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Do you think you're alone?

464
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
My friends, you're not

465
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Come on over to the TechX podcast

466
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
at feeds.feberter.com slash techX

467
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And listen to my stories

468
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Point a laugh at me

469
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So if you can

470
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Come on over to feeds.feberter.com slash techX

471
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Like I said

472
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And share in our global computer paid

473
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Because I know I'm not by myself

474
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And I want to let you guys know that you're not alone either

475
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah

476
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Thank you

477
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's good to know

478
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm going to subscribe because I am definitely one of those people

479
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Everybody calls me

480
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Any my house particularly

481
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Now I have a deal with Christina

482
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I told her I'd get her windows machine

483
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But I said that I could not promise that I could support her on it

484
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The way she'd like it or the way she's used to

485
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Because boy, I've had all of those phone calls

486
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Hey, there's something sticking on it

487
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
All I have is some juice here

488
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't understand

489
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But now Patricia of course has the

490
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Has the eye Mac

491
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The member the old one that I bought just before the new ones came out

492
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I haven't even replaced it yet

493
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm doing everything on the new power book

494
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Playback and recording

495
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And so now Patricia has the eye Mac

496
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And so I have some support issues that I have to help her with

497
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But it's really so minimal

498
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Because it's usually just a question of

499
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
User not reading

500
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And of course it's you get used to not reading stuff

501
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And you're a little pop up windows and a big flashing

502
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Okay blue ball

503
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Like I get rid of that

504
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What did it say?

505
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh, I didn't read it

506
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Okay

507
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But yeah, you do find yourself in that position

508
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
If you have anything to do with computers or internet

509
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Then you get the call

510
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And of course you want to help people out

511
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You know, I always say hey I'm going to help you

512
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But just so you know the way it works

513
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And this is actually from the Unix days

514
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
If you teach somebody

515
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The person who received that lesson

516
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Is obligated to turn around

517
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And help the health and the next person

518
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That is really the only way to make it work

519
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But then with windows I'm so lost sometimes

520
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm just blown away

521
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I see that Intel is gearing up for their core processor

522
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
They're dropping the Intel inside

523
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's becoming I think it's the core or core or something like that

524
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Which is interesting because we have a core acronym that we use

525
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
With inside pod show as well which is

526
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Was it a content organization and recommendation engine

527
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So it is actually something that exists

528
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's nothing that we would brand per se

529
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
But that's kind of interesting that Intel now comes out with a core

530
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And I guess their entire mission is to create the next

531
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Version of processor

532
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And DSP chips and all that stuff that you need

533
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
To really create great experiences

534
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
With that come some things that

535
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And I don't know everything about it

536
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But there's certainly going to be doing a lot with audio

537
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And I think that the

538
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The validity of what audio is going to be played

539
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Is going to be checked at the processor level now

540
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So basically DRM will be embedded very very deep

541
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
If you have any information on that

542
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Please let me know please send it an audio comment

543
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I hate reading out emails

544
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I really do I'd much prefer you

545
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Send in an audio

546
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You know what I'm going to do

547
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm just going to

548
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I have to figure out a way if you just send it

549
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
No actually we have something cool

550
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
A show notes module that will be coming up

551
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
When we open up the network

552
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
As a part of that the podcast delivery network

553
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm going to have a really interesting feedback

554
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Which I'll just have to bear until then

555
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Neil Harrington says

556
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Been a long time listening to your podcast

557
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I think I started around episode 10

558
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Oh wow

559
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Dropped an email about mashups in the drum lines

560
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Okay, I recall that I probably didn't reply

561
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm sorry because of your product placement of Senseo

562
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I was intrigued by the single serve coffee concept

563
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I didn't research and decided to add Senseo to my Amazon wish list

564
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And my girlfriend bought it for me for Christmas

565
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
To my surprise the Senseo has

566
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It was even better than advertised

567
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I love it and have made recommendations to my friends cheers

568
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Says Neil

569
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah, someone outside salesperson

570
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
My territory includes Menlo Park

571
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
If you ever want a free lunch should be an email

572
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
We could meet up. Yeah, free lunch

573
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's right. No free lunch. You know that

574
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I knew thank you very much

575
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Just to reiterate

576
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't get paid

577
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
For mentioning the Senseo coffee machine

578
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I just love it

579
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I really do. You heard how defensive I got

580
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
When Barbara tried to pull it out of my hands

581
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It was standing here on the

582
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
On the podcast complex console

583
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And she's grabbing

584
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I was like at least a third full

585
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I mean come on. It's still a temperature left to it

586
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Let me see

587
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
One more while we're still on the satellite

588
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
As you know, daily source code is a

589
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Time will cast it on serious satellite

590
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Stars 103

591
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
After this show, if you're listening to me now on serious

592
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We've got Pacific Coast Hellway

593
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Followed by Madge Weinstein

594
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
We got this in great music for you later on tonight

595
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That's a whole the whole Potsho line up

596
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Let's see

597
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I have this here

598
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Okay, this is highway 61 Romeo Bartlett

599
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Like to thank you for what you're doing with podcasting

600
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's pretty ironic that I'm into your gig though

601
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I have two sons who used to be really into MTV when they were young

602
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
They used to be

603
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I always considered MTV to be the root cause of the end of creative music

604
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Since any ass with a catchy video could become a star

605
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I expressed to my young sons and told them the sanitized version of

606
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Adam Curry is a big-haired fag

607
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Since I've been digging the DSC

608
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I've been trying to get them interested in podcasting

609
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
In general on the DSC in particular

610
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
They both remembered and reminded what I said about you

611
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
All those years ago I told them well

612
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yeah, okay, he's still the same guy but

613
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Without the big hair in the shitty videos

614
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Just strikes me funny as how life can throw these little ironies at you

615
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Uh-huh

616
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And he also said he wanted smack me because

617
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
He found us in sao coffee machine at a local pharmacy chain for 40 bucks

618
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And he's digging it

619
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Right on, thanks Romeo

620
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Okay

621
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Metro sexual moment coming up in just a few seconds

622
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Big response on this

623
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Unbelievable how many people how many guys at least have

624
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You know have something to say about in this case

625
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
We're talking about shaving and moisturizing

626
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But first let's wave goodbye to our folks on the satellite

627
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
We'll talk to you guys tomorrow

628
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Metro sexual

629
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Metro sexual

630
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Metro sexual

631
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Metro sexual

632
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Metro sexual

633
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It's Alan Curry's Metro sexual moment

634
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah

635
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And Curry's Metro sexual moment

636
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Yeah

637
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
All pinfield road sum up on the show notes

638
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Which you can get to from

639
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
DailySourceCode.com

640
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Of course, that's the wonderful show notes dot info service

641
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
We show notes, you can contribute

642
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And people really do, it's very nice

643
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Um, Paul Beanfield says now that we've moved from shaving to perfume

644
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
etc, I have a question of course I moisturize after shaving

645
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Vaseline intensive care

646
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Dermacare

647
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Trust me, it's real good shit

648
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm 40 and I make you look like an old hag

649
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
My question is am I the only guy who wears women's perfume

650
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I use Calvin Klein obsession

651
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I think that I love the smell of it on a woman

652
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Why should I wear it?

653
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Hair on your palms dude

654
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I love it so much better than the horseshit that is offloaded as after shave

655
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Sure, so women think I'm battling for Lancashire

656
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I guess it's a gay reference

657
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm batting for Lancashire

658
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Okay, but they don't bother me because they tend to be ugly and angry

659
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Magic contact you lately

660
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I figured they should have bigger things to worry about

661
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So much of the fragrance market is piss and wind

662
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So what are we all wearing?

663
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm out

664
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
How many others are there?

665
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Well I have to say

666
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Interesting, I have a myriad

667
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
But right now I'm into the Calvin Klein stuff as well

668
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But it's not the the girl fragrance it's the

669
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Shit, I'll have to look it up

670
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So much for the preparation of the show

671
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Charles Ravira says

672
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Regarding your metro sexual moment

673
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You're right on on the blade composition

674
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
They use higher carbon steel which can be honed much sharper

675
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
The blades are ultimately going to last as long as stainless blades but could

676
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Since they're much sharper right out of the box

677
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
They'll do just fine for introducing the products

678
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Hmm, this is about the difference between the introduction blade and the replacement blades

679
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Which apparently are not made from the same higher carbon steel

680
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
They can't be honed to the edge

681
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And so they'll need replacing more often since they don't stay as sharp

682
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Wow

683
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But they are cheaper to produce so it's a win-win for blade makers

684
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Which makes the loose loose for the customer

685
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
No kidding, that's fantastic

686
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Okay, so apparently there is indeed a difference

687
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
As also noted on a visual

688
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Inspection by Andrew Grummit

689
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So

690
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
We need to get some engineers or someone to really look into this

691
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
We need CSI investigation, you know, we're so ratio

692
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
CQ says resistive sending a male for ages

693
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
But now I've been down the

694
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Juicer getting loop what the hell was that mean

695
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Anyway, CQ says

696
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
But the listeners get razor burn, then try tened skin

697
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Or if they live in Australia they should get stop ingrow

698
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
These are alcohol based sprays or lotions that contain aspirin

699
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
They're marketed to women but are great on the sensitive necks as well

700
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
The alcohol sues after burning the shaved areas and stops razor bumps

701
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The aspirin also makes the hair stubble stand up before reducing the chances of ingrowing

702
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I also nicked my flatmates Mark III greeny thing with vibroaction and tried it

703
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's bloody excellent better than the Mark III, although I don't buy gelette

704
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Because they still test on animals apparently

705
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Dude

706
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
They test on animals, what they trust they test shavers on animals

707
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Okay, hey, here we go. We got an audio comment here

708
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'll see what to see if I can do this

709
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Oh shit this is so suck

710
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Maybe she's just

711
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
See, that's the problem with a two channel mixer

712
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Let's try that again. Here we go. Say it

713
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Hey Adam, what's up?

714
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
This is Damon from indiependants.com

715
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
You hit on something so very important

716
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
The DSC 3.06

717
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Any of the razor that you use in that guarantees a good shave

718
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's the products that you put on your face

719
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
For the longest time I used this thick gelette shaving cream

720
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And it did all right, but it always ended up in like a sore face

721
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Using half way through the day I just had some burning flesh on my face

722
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
When my wife's cosmatologist ended

723
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
She did a great thing for me. She got me this bio elements for him

724
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Shaving cream and after shaved moisturizer

725
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It was a little awkward at first using this stuff

726
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
But the first time I used it

727
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I had my first metro sexual moment

728
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm telling you this shaving cream is just smooth

729
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It's butter. You put on thin layers

730
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So you feel like you just actually shave and skin

731
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And just not shave and cream off your face

732
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And the first time I used it after shaved serum

733
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I could not believe it. My skin was tight

734
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
My complexion was good

735
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Man, when I use this stuff I walk upstairs

736
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I wake up my wife and it's boring

737
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
She loves it too

738
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
So in my opinion Adam

739
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It's definitely the products that you put on your face

740
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It's not the razor

741
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I just wanted to hear what you thought about that

742
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Thanks a lot

743
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The shampoo

744
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Products be very important

745
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I think we all agree on that

746
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And then finally for today's metro sexual moment

747
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Paul Muller sent an all thing about

748
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
This shaving kitty got from his great uncle

749
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And you know he had the screw down razor blades

750
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
He's been using the same one for 8 million years

751
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
What I like the most of is he ends up by saying

752
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
By the way, I had a very metro Christmas this year

753
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
My wife got me a Terry cloth bathrobe from L.O.B.

754
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm believable how it feels

755
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Only heathens rub themselves after a shower

756
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Refined folk air dry

757
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Okay guys, it was nice hanging with you

758
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And talking around the water cooler about our personal hygiene

759
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And our shaving habits and the perfumes we wear

760
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Let's keep this up because to me it's very very liberating

761
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Oh yeah, you got to check this out

762
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
This came in from the on safe music network

763
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I have something

764
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Sipes their DJ

765
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I want to take you on a little sound scene

766
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
To a high have something

767
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Did a Trinity remix by a diesel

768
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Future by a diesel by a diesel me

769
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
By a diesel by a diesel

770
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Oh, I am so excited

771
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Will you sell me this car

772
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
If you figure it out yet

773
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I actually reached my park that was going to pull it out and start talking

774
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
If you figure it out

775
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And ladies and gentlemen

776
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I present you with Trinity Trinity

777
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It is about the on list

778
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
The on list car I've ever seen in my entire life

779
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
That's about all the luxury you're going to get

780
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
By a diesel by a diesel

781
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
By a diesel by a diesel

782
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Oh, I am so excited

783
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
She's just like a young cute

784
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
What is this set to?

785
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
That's me kicking the rear bumper

786
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Oh, she's nice and sail

787
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Hold these different things

788
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Got my coat on

789
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Hello, hello, hello

790
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Coming down at you

791
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Okay, I want to say

792
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Okay, I want to say

793
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Right, and it is all ready

794
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Clean it up with a biop diesel

795
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
99.9% vegetable oil

796
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Pressure

797
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Listen to that puppy first

798
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And the runs on the chart

799
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
By a diesel by a diesel

800
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
By a diesel by a diesel

801
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Oh, I am so excited

802
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
This car was mentioned for me

803
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And it runs like a chart

804
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Okay, you just see me driving down

805
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
First straight in San Francisco

806
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
With this pumping in the music video

807
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
By a diesel by the biodiesel

808
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
For some reason I care

809
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Excellent dude, cypster DJ, biodiesel

810
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Available now on the pod save music network

811
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And that's going to sound good in the club, man

812
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I tell you

813
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
All right, everybody, thanks for listening

814
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'll be back tomorrow

815
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
We'll have our midweek edition of the daily source code

816
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Preparing for

817
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Departure to San Francisco

818
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Leaving on Sunday with the virgin

819
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
We'll be flying away

820
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
For a stint on the rig

821
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And it's going to be very busy two weeks

822
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Because we'll be opening up pieces of the network

823
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
We'll be finally the strategy cast

824
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
We'll get made now

825
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
We're kind of all in sync with development

826
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
We can actually talk about it on the strategy cast

827
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I know it's been a couple weeks

828
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
That I've been promising you this

829
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But I guess in the end it's going to be much better

830
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Because we'll really be able to talk about some things

831
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
That are real you can go check out

832
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And

833
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah, we'll do whatever we do

834
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So thanks for checking it out
