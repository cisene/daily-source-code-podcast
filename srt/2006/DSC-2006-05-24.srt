Though they might be quite far from home.

New Yorker's San Fran without her just wouldn't be right.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, she's the real reason for Adam to come home tonight.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But when they're away and they both want to play at the flick of the wrist or a puff on the split,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
they can find their way around, paint their whole town for sure.

60
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,360
are we have an incredible headphone problems today you hear me now yeah okay there we go

61
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:31,240
hey everybody Christ the sucks hold on honey yeah I'm I have to I have to let me unplug you

62
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,160
let me unplug you on so you can't hear anything hold on can you hear at least one year now

63
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,160
yeah yeah okay I'm sorry so apparently I I'm so stupid I left

64
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:51,480
I left the cottage and I brought a half the equipment with me I brought with me no headphone

65
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,320
extender cables so Patricia has to sit really really close now I brought two microphones but I

66
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:06,200
forgot that this I wish you can you move that microphone up a little bit because you're a little bit

67
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:18,360
soft yeah yeah there you go so you have no place to no I'm not there you go speak speak speak speak

68
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:25,320
yeah it's okay very good I forgot that the power supply I have for the for the mixing board

69
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,440
is it's a UK power supply but it's it's one of the only ones in the world that only does

70
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:38,120
220 volts doesn't do 110 volts so you plug it in no 110 and it powers the mixer enough for it

71
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,280
to work but if you want to actually plug in the second microphone then you then you get that because

72
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,080
it doesn't have enough power so we'll fix it when we get to monitor it yes I think that the story of my

73
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:56,360
life what and home it always sounds like that I always have shitty sounds no what are you talking

74
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,720
about the studio at the cottage is great what are you talking about equipment I'm talking about

75
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:07,080
equipment I'm talking about equipment now equipment that I should have you know listening to music

76
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:15,000
and also it's always half half it doesn't work or is that my fault yes no I mean yeah I have

77
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,080
that because we move and then you say I'll do that later yeah I say that right yeah that's true

78
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:28,200
say I'll fix it up do the wire later now I must say it's such a mess look at this you know

79
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,840
and it doesn't even work I do that later and it's just never happens well I promise you

80
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,520
when we if the Patricia's palace actually comes to fruition or any Patricia's palace for that

81
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:46,440
and for that I promise you that I'll do all the wires I have a good music throughout the whole house

82
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,560
yeah we'll get so we'll get so into we'll get some of the do it properly now I will say

83
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,000
that you know of course I have a lot of wires and it's very difficult to find enough plugs

84
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,840
in any hotel room and what do I have with me is my trusty gaffer tape yeah so is it so we have a

85
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,680
very professional gray strip of tape hiding a wire that runs across the we moved hotels we're in

86
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,520
yeah yeah that's what I want to say yeah we're in the Waldorf Astoria tower yeah this is more my taste

87
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,120
this is definitely yeah this is my taste no kidding we're on the like the 38th floor beautiful

88
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,240
we checked in yesterday let me just give you a recap first I don't think actually that not just you know

89
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,400
not that I don't like modern or you know 20 hotels but but they have to be functioned yes exactly

90
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:37,960
until now we notice that it just doesn't function it all and it falls apart yeah that's not fair

91
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,960
yeah because I actually asked Ron a pay a lot of money yeah yeah I said Ron I said where did you put

92
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,160
your your shaving kit you know every guy has a bag with shaving kit and stuff you said well I

93
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,160
had to put it on the floor and if Marta would call him while I was peeing in the bathroom you would

94
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:58,120
actually turn around and peeing to his it was shaving kit I could just see him doing that no it's

95
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,120
not not if you have a shaving kit it's not fun you're totally wet because the shower leaves

96
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,120
because you take a shower and the thing is a little bit stupid you know so we recommend not

97
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,840
staying at the W Hotel that is not not high in Patricia's recommendation no no no we just do a list

98
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,560
actually yeah I'm very good at it because and I'm not talking about you know it doesn't

99
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,760
need to be always classical it's my taste but I do understand that sometimes people like to

100
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,440
have a very nice and trendy hotel yeah but you know if it doesn't work it doesn't function

101
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,920
and you're not getting what you actually should have for your money what you're paying for

102
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,320
you're paying for no crank up a little bit no little more power there thank you Jeff Smith by

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:43,320
let's see we went down to uh center street yeah and we stood in lots of lines yeah um had

154
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:49,880
look money orders and cash payments and black pen only and the only thing I heard

155
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:58,760
constantly was that's $3 that's $3 that's $2 that's $20 that you know from well for as much

156
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,040
we had to go to four offices four offices to get this done because you have to get you know

157
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,840
first you have to get a copy then the copy has to be signed and the signature has to be

158
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:15,960
notarized then the notary has to be uh for scene of an upostille yeah which is a French word for

159
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,840
another piece of paper with a signature and a raised deal but we got it all so now we get back

160
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,280
uh lots of foreigners actually what we did and so we were in line at the marriage bureau to get into

161
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:33,960
the building um just that was the first the first step um and and and that's where you go if you're

162
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:40,280
getting you know if for any marriage stuff I guess and well we have to actually be honest we lost

163
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:47,560
our American certificate who's who's we chemo sobbe who's we so that that it goes it doesn't matter

164
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,120
it doesn't matter it it would it would have been older than five years anyway it doesn't matter

165
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,400
we needed a new one anywhere it can be older than five years so we needed a new one yeah but you

166
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,040
can be honest about you losing the marriage certificate. No it is somewhat but you know if somewhere

167
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:08,200
in three house somebody moves so many times like we did and we have so many boxes and still boxes

168
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:17,800
somewhere who knows what's in there so we're waiting in line and uh the guard says uh oh you're from

169
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Holland because he asked that he was checking ID member the guy yeah it says you're from Holland

170
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,200
well congratulations welcome to America that was really he didn't know that we've been married for 20

171
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,760
years or whatever he said welcome to America that's so sweet and then he said hey by the way is it true

172
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:37,320
what they say about Amsterdam or Rotterdam you can get you smoke get you smoke yeah dude I'm hammered

173
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:44,520

174
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:51,000

175
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,200
and so then after we were done with all that and we actually made it on time we made it before the

176
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,160
330 deadline when all the offices closed and then because we could I was so unfortunate we couldn't

177
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:07,320
stay in extra night in the W Hotel I really tried to get an extension on our style I miss Emily's that

178
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:15,400
bad I miss the beautiful bathroom so I was able to get us a beautiful room in the in the

179
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,880
story tower so in the room and I said you know what because American Idol was going to be on

180
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,920
we were going to you know Yvonne was going to come over and have some tea your sister who's in town

181
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,160
on business so you know what I'll set up the studio now so we'll have good sound then of course

182
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:36,680
you know again apologies that I messed up half the wiring but you left your phone charger

183
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:46,440
and the you left your own charge but it was on your excuse me you brought the phone

184
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,840
charger was never in my possession it's your own phone look you have to be responsible for your

185
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,880
own communications infrastructure it's true that's true but attached to that phone charger was my

186
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,280
adapter and that of course I should have my phone charging your adapter you've got the

187
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:08,680
adapter and my phone charger was in there so so when we arrived here and we said we were very

188
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:18,760
tired take your hand away because you're covering them all right and well couldn't say anything anymore

189
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:25,320
I mean I had to put my my feet up because you're walking a lot here you know and you walk fast

190
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:32,040
it's very hard for me you're like there's so much longer than mine so when we came here we were

191
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:39,640
tired tight tight tight tight tight and I said well you know I'll go outside and I'll find our we

192
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:45,880
I'll find my a new charger and a new adapter and an adapter for you because I felt very very

193
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:53,480
you know bad about it so we went outside first I went down stairs in the shop didn't have it went

194
00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:02,200
to the next hotel didn't have it and so I walked on Lexington Avenue and finally as I found

195
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:08,520
sort of that foreign electrical stores that they had like a fifth of a new camera size screaming outside

196
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:17,320
hey one of my GPS yeah but actually when I was walking outside I thought oh my god I forgot my

197
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,840
piece of plastic in my mouth because I told you I told the the peeps

198
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,800
yeah a couple of days ago that I went to the dentist and he took everything out on one side

199
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:36,440
so you have a little snap-in plate with some of my 10th temporary things and it's not teeth

200
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,040
it's actually mullers you know well but but if you don't have them in a smile or the canine you know

201
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:47,880
the canine the the hooked on yeah so and went whenever you smile now with the other day

202
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,080
at the end of the day just let me explain so people can get a visual okay yeah when you smile smile

203
00:20:53,080 --> 00:21:02,200
for me and I have a smile smile you look like a pirate yes a pirate and I have a big smile yeah

204
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:09,720
with a big baby holy yeah you see a hundred teeth when I smile yeah and so while I was

205
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,040
walking on Lexington I thought oh girl I have no teeth I doesn't matter because no I don't need

206
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:21,560
this smile to anybody anyway so and when I speak you don't see it only when I give my big smile

207
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,240
so I'm walking and so I found that store I got it I walked all the way back I came to the hotel

208
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:34,040
stepped into the elevator and halfway the elevator stopped and I thought shit I want to be upstairs now

209
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:43,480
the door's open and a bunch of gorgeous I mean you know very well dressed men step into my

210
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,560
you're the only one on the elevator the only one in elevator so I go back a little bit and

211
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:54,920

216
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,000
the moment he's tall he's he's very impressed he was standing in front of me and I thought whoa yeah

after that well he didn't say anything but he was very very very charming and if learning

226
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,320
and what did he say don't just say that I mean so you said hello and I gave him the big

from Lisa yeah and she says hi Adam and she says she's one of the one of the assistance

that that I've been working with says listen to your podcast pretty impressive but the accent

290
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,160
wasn't quite doing it for me despite you thinking that it was a big hit with us PA's I almost fell

00:30:51,160 --> 00:31:01,720
off my chair laughing when I heard that you cheeky bugger but even when I said you know

292
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,840
Patricia will probably think I'm so full of myself apparently apparently I am well

293
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:13,720
you I know you for years and well I'm a cheeky bugger now you are she's absolutely right last night

294
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:20,280
we watched American Idol anything you want to say about that the two finalists you being the

295
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,120
the musical despair wow they they're both great singers yeah he's moved your hair away from

296
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,280
some of my yeah I can hear all of New York I can barely hear you yeah it's kind of so

297
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,840
okay like this much better can you just yeah and I can see your boobies now too that's good yeah

298
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:43,720
do that just keep like that I'm very good the very good singers both unbelievable I mean

299
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:51,560
I think that the singer's equality is so much better than in Europe I have to say well the

300
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:57,000
I mean I mean of of the idols competition in Europe oh yeah blows him away you kidding me

301
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I mean unbelievable and I don't I don't see the guy what's his name Taylor Taylor

302
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:12,600
nice nice guy but see him is an idol I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't think it's a time with more

303
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:23,480
I have to say vocally I thought what's your name Katie I think she has a much more

304
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,600
interesting range there's more things she could do she could be musical she could be

305
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:35,720
recording star she is beautiful maybe she she X I don't know everybody X anyway in America

306
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:45,400
but I think that she is multi multi talented and multi-aggressive so beautiful stunning stunning

307
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:51,400
but the only thing I noticed is she shouldn't wear shoes with ribbons on them no no no that was

308
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:57,320
not it notice that she doesn't know what she's singing yet the the words doesn't weigh anything

309
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:05,400
right she hasn't had enough sex life she hasn't had no heartbreak you know that's the only thing

310
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,040
she doesn't it doesn't it's not together with her heart yet

311
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,680
right yeah she has my dad stick around the in the in the mainstream music business for a while

312
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,680
she she she she'll get her heart broken enough time she she'll get that soon enough and then we'll

313
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:26,360
welcome her with open arms to the pod sick music network that's really fabulous but yeah and I

314
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,320
think she should be the winner okay well I guess we find out tonight is that tonight although I

315
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,680
hear that the voice of the guy is is fantastic yeah but he it doesn't go with his body and

316
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:43,160
everything I don't know it he could be this jockey something wrong and I'm not don't mean that

317
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,560
you cannot be fat or I don't know what because you can be fat up there's a disconnect and we've

318
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:57,080
no hair and be a great idol yeah but I don't see it you know what I mean I have a feeling he might

319
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:04,120
win though for some reason because he it is such an American he's such an American regular I don't know

320
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,800
it's just like it's I don't know I got a feeling that that Americans might really vote for him

321
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:15,720
yeah because they can also justify with him maybe and we're tired of chicks winning you know

322
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:22,120
pretty girls with great voices that they keep winning American Idol you kidding me Kelly Clark's

323
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:32,360
and yeah and we had like maybe we were better yeah maybe you know and well just before

324
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:39,080
American Idol started I checked into second life and you know that Brittany Mason and Magic

328
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,120
your face like maybe I should just stop right now maybe maybe I should just not say anything anymore
