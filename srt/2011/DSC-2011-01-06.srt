Delta Sheriff Charlie eight five seven welcome to your food bar Friday

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's go and get a fly up.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There's a mall will feel like we've been hit by a trucker.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's get far off.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go to a confite, burn which burn.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The hall must have been hot white.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Never ever return.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We'll go to the free of all of you.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We've got to need a shrink to get back again.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's get far off.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's get far off.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's get lost off.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let's get far off.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To far off we'll feel like we've been hit by a trucker.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's get far off.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Go to a confite, burn which burn.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Go to a confite, burn.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Go to a confite, burn.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Go to a confite, burn.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We'll go to the free of all of you.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We've got to need a shrink to get back again.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's get far off.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
To far off we'll feel like we've been hit by a trucker.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's get far off.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's get lost off.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Right now.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's get right back again.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let's get right back again.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's get right back again.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let's get lost off.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Get right back again.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Let's get left back again.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Slipp on our turn of change

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And now they am a sure night

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Do some purple haze

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And I probably lose some fight

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And get cool, cool, cool

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Get really sad

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Take some cool and unusual

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Punishment, I let's get back down

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let's get back up

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And let's get some stuff

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And let's get back up

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You know tomorrow, we'll feel like we was hit by a truck

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But let's get back up

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Baby, baby, baby, baby

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's grab all that air

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And move the mirror

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We'll take a look

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Down into that serious fucking

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We'll make one big grease

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Fire us out

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, I want to be your son

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
These two walls

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We'll fight, cool, cool

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The ultimate material

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Cycle, tapio, sexual

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Slipp on

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Two balls

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Two balls

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
One ball

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
One ball

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
One ball

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
One ball

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, I'd say this is perfect

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Can't start for a footballer

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Friday, Danny source code episode

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000

Globally, acknowledge at the stream.com

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000

Which you can find is live.knowage in the mix

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Colon 8000

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I know it's not that simple

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But where you work making that all easier

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There's a girl running around my head

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No, she makes me feel

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
She may be crazy, she may not be ready

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
She may not feel like the lack of a footballer

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I've got a bigger, the next messer

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I look, the girl, you make me cry

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
She may be crazy, she may not be ready

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
She may never feel like

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Black on my support

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Black on my support

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Black on my support

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Black on the sun

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,300
It's a dance, I'm feeling like I'm from you

92
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,500
No, when you make me fall down

93
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,500
No, when you make me fall down

94
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Never fuck up for me

95
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,300
Take out my tails, but I'm not a control

96
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,100
I've got a woman who's a devil's own

97
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,100
She may be crazy, makes me dream, it must

98
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,700
She may be feeling like I'm from I'm from you

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Like I'm from I'm from I'm from you

100
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,600
Take out my tails, but I'm not a control

101
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,900
I've got a woman who's a devil's own

102
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,500
She may be saved, and he's safe, and he's sick

103
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,600
Take out my tails, but I'm not a control

104
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,640
I was attentive when I got from you

105
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,500
That wouldn't make the sudden wind

106
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
it down

107
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,440
Let's go

108
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:54,400
It's nothing like listening to the stream, 24-7, it seems as if you've heard the

109
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,320
Oh, that was too expensive.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,800
Did you like it?

111
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,440
Again

112
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,520
Joss...

113
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,960
Let's lock it up

114
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes, that's it

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, I have to find out what the fuck I'm from here!

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm mother fucker from here!

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If steady source code 857,

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
those of you who've been missing be show on the podcast,

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I've had some issues with the MVOC of Servers uploading these big files.

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Have not been able to successfully upload it completely.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Stay tuned for more info on that as we get the show rolling.

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let us on J.H.

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
In ways to keep me, to feel tired of you,

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
to die, to feel tired of you, to die.

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If you've been able to do it,

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I've had a problem in a certain time,

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and the question is,

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
why is it all mine?

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I've had a problem in a certain time,

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I've had a problem in a certain time,

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I've had a problem in a certain time,

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and the question is,

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
why is it all mine?

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I've had a problem in a certain time,

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and the question is,

136
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
why is it all mine?

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's because it's all mine.

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I've had a problem in a certain time,

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and the question is,

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
why is it all mine?

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I've had a problem in a certain time,

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
which is it all mine?

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Or is it all mine?

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Or is it all mine?

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Or is it all mine?

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Or is it all mine?

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No matter I totally understand,

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's not even possible, but I'm not saying for the fact that

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm saying for the fact that

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's out of order

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm saying for the fact that

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes, now it's not a suicide

153
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's a piece of music that's quite a myth on you

154
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's a real real from the fact that it is a game to say

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Every choice, and a scene, every choice

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes, yes, now it's not a suicide, but tell me

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If you want to see what's on your mind

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Do you feel sometimes?

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Is it you, too?

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I can help you, and I can help you all yourself

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Don't want to see what I'm doing

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm saying for the fact that it is not a suicide

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's out of order

164
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Nice

165
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Turns coming in fast and fierce, now the dropbox

166
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
They've no more

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Very cool

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Here's how to order

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
See the lies of such lies

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We make nothing but things that come around people

171
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's far in lies, preferably desert

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
As friends, we pray to you in today

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
On the streams, we go to thestream.com

174
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Who's your daddy's source call?

175
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Episode five

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Thank you so much for participating in the show as always

177
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Hopefully we'll be able to upload this one to the media servers

178
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I had something to limit, but I've been

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't know, it was some verdict to a can't quite figure it out

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But we've got the stream got plenty of people checking it

181
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
No agenda chat dot net, that's where the party is right now

182
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This is what we're getting the back of the pool

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm doing this

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What's that like to talk about?

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Damn it for everything, so make it up and up like

186
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You and X-Law, do you want to just get lost?

187
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Rout was X, so I'd raise my kind of luck

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
As a crowd, I'd raise cows

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I dreadful as dogs, I lift the speed and thus go

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
While you're monkey thunking

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I turn up junkies, I'm afraid to be a wreck

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And my rap just crunching to the job of metal

193
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You can't grab the scramble

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Stop the football, come to Cleveland, like nothing

195
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You're so good, grab the scramble

196
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So let's get four, but I'll sit and clean

197
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We'll stand up, run the scramble, like nothing

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You ain't tryna love how to stop, run the game

199
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
We're not making people the music kids

200
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
There's nothing to do, my tank, the brothers in the crowd

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Then it's good grief

202
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Mothers and bays, keep them all in a day

203
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's true, Jack, you're not going to know me

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can't get the tool, I take my top body

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So only my pony, I'll track my pony out of my farm

207
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And believe the mayor's the pleasure

208
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Cast the place, the gate, so I can get my fathom

209
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Get the belly, get your squad luck

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I won't take me, go for things in the front

211
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's not a tool, right?

212
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You're all the men in good aesthetic

213
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So tell us less than you say, ready me, the captain

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll post my mouth, get nuts, the captain

215
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's crazy, make a proud, make your heart into it

216
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'll trust in the door, support all the best gentlemen

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And drop the lead

218
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You're all the critters, it's a powerful rock

219
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We're the life of ways, good luck

220
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We can trust, make your change

221
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You're all the men in good aesthetic

222
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So tell us less than you say, ready me, go for things in the front

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

224
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

225
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

226
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's true, Jack, you're not going to know me

227
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're all the men in good aesthetic

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So tell us less than you say, ready me, go for things in the front

229
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's not a tool, right?

230
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You're all the men in good aesthetic

231
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So tell us less than you say, ready me, go for things in the front

232
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

233
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

234
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

235
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

236
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

237
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

238
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

241
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

242
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

243
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

245
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

246
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We're the house of ways, good grief

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

248
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

249
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

250
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

251
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

252
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

253
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

254
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
We're the life of ways, good grief

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I've got to tell you, I still don't know why.

257
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm trying to get in my way.

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I've got to tell you, I still don't know why.

259
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:58,000
These guys do not have the same career as a rage against the machine or fake the more.

260
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
For tons of other fans, they are Dutch and they kick out.

261
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Urban Dance Squad.

262
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I don't know if you've got any damn good stuff.

263
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Alright, so damn online now, of course, in the chat room, no agenda chat.net.

264
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
If you have the opportunity to log in there, that's where the party always takes place.

265
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
We've got a brand new human resource, or should I say, maybe not so human resource, checkin' in.

266
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It is Doug, and Doug announces all the tracks as they come along.

267
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So you don't even have to look at your player anymore.

268
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You're great.

269
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Good grief.

270
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That's right.

271
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Manor from the Dropbox.

272
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
From the hilltop, Walks Tower, Trackbox, Mancenter, and it sounds like a deja vu.

273
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The system is awesome.

274
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Once again, I can do my nails.

275
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The system takes care of the rest.

276
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Here's the Donners.

277
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't wait up for me, baby.

278
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Boy, I got you number.

279
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That doesn't mean I have to call you.

280
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Again, yourself together.

281
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Cause I don't need you like you call me, you too, God.

282
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Listen up, train the car.

283
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's time to tear it up.

284
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We're like a sunshine and the night is young.

285
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So don't wait up for me.

286
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I need another hand, before I'm done.

287
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So don't wait up for me.

288
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Boy, don't try to fall me down.

289
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You're not the only one who's on my mind, God.

290
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Enough to go around.

291
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If you can't take it, you'll be left behind, God.

292
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Listen up, train the car.

293
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's time to tear it up.

294
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We're like a sunshine and the night is young.

295
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So don't wait up for me.

296
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I need another hand, before I'm done.

297
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So don't wait up for me.

298
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
There's no telling where I'm going to show up.

299
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Nobody knows how tonight will end.

300
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
There's no telling where I'm going to wake up.

301
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Boy, don't try to fall me down.

302
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Enough to go around.

303
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:52,000
We're like a sunshine and the night is young.

304
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
God, listen up.

305
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Listen up.

306
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Train the car.

307
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Train the time to tear it up.

308
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No, I need another hand.

309
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But I got one shot in the night is y'all

310
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So don't wait and hold me

311
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I need another hit, for I'm done

312
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So don't wait and hold me

313
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What I got one shot in the night is y'all

314
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So don't wait and hold me

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I need another hit, for I'm done

316
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So don't wait and hold me

317
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'll tell you what I got one shot in the night

318
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And then here's a sound of an entire nation

319
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But what we know is get more nation

320
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The years it comes to you

321
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
From all the human resources around the nation

322
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Who are finally nicely distracted slaves

323
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Just doing their bit for humanity

324
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Indeed I should drop a dunk human resource

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Dunk before setting up the dunk in the chat room

326
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's very cool Doug announces these track

327
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
As it comes by 24 hours a day

328
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The guy is tireless, he never seems to wear out

329
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And of course we also have our news reader

330
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Who brings you the Ministry of Truth

331
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Get my nation headlines on this dream

332
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Once an hour

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
24-7

334
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That is as long as I'm monitoring everything

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Because it does all there's some bugs here now

336
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We'll be talking about that today

337
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
We are working with a group of

338
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Sister admins, engineers, programmers

339
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Enthusiasts, music, maidens

340
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
All trying to put something together here

341
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Which is turning out to be incredibly awesome

342
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm very excited about it

343
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
All right

344
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Practice what I'm proud of you

345
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
To smack my bitch up

346
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm proud of you

347
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
To smack my bitch up

348
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm proud of you

349
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
To smack my bitch up

350
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm proud of you

351
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
To smack my bitch up

352
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm proud of you

353
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
To smack my bitch up

354
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm proud of you

355
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
To smack my bitch up

356
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm proud of you

357
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
To smack my bitch up

820
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:15,100
get all your expensive stuff,

821
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,640
I'll set it up and it's all configured,

822
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,280
and I'll work in nicely.

823
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,600
There's always something to broan,

824
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,960
he who spills his corona over the equipment.

825
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,520
Well, not quite over the equipment luckily,

826
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:28,880
but definitely on the furnishing here.

827
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,440
So give me a second while I clean all of that up

828
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,280
and then we'll get back to doing the shows.

829
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,720
I promised you three beats songs in a row.

830
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,280
Wow, it smells like beer in here.

831
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,160
It's Ryan Paris, the Delta Vita.

832
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:55,680
We're walking like in the Dolce and Vita.

833
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,680
This time we've got it, right?

834
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:04,680
We're living in the Dolce and Vita.

835
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:08,680
We're walking like in the Dolce and Vita.

836
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:11,680
This time we've got it, right?

837
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:16,680
We're living like in the Dolce Vita.

838
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:20,680
We're going to dream tonight.

839
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:24,680
We're dancing like in the Dolce Vita.

840
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:28,680
We're like some music home.

841
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:32,680
I love it's made of the Dolce Vita.

842
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:36,680
Nobody else than you.

843
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:43,680
It's always night together with our love again.

844
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:53,680
Another life before we're trying to talk to say you never live now.

845
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,680
Say you're gonna love it now.

846
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:15,680
We made it down with Dolce Vita.

847
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:22,680
We're living like in the Dolce Vita.

848
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:31,680
I'm so alone in the Dolce Vita.

849
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:38,680
We're living like in the Dolce Vita.

850
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:42,680
Nobody else than you.

851
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:50,680
It's always night together with our love again.

852
01:18:50,680 --> 01:19:00,680
Another life before we're trying to talk to say you never live now.

853
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:10,680
Say you're gonna love it's always night together with our love again.

854
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:19,680
Another life before we're trying to talk to say you never live now.

855
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:26,680
Say you're gonna love it now.

856
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:37,680
Say you're gonna love it now right?

857
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:43,680
Say you're gonna love it now.

858
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:48,680
Hey, hey, GX2!

859
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,680
Pogad, your speakers!

860
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:53,680
Right to a lot there and give on nationies, man.

861
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:55,680
Right to a lot.

862
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,680
Okay.

863
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:02,680
Some of the Mexican beer spill that's been cleaned up.

864
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,680
Don't worry, it's just the blowout protector

865
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,680
that wasn't configured properly.

866
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,680
It'll be okay.

867
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:11,680
Right Paris, the Dulce Vita, I have to say the 12 inch version

868
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,680
of that is something that has to be experienced.

869
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,680
And of course, another example of a track you just don't hear on the radio anymore,

870
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,680
which is what we're all about here.

871
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,680
Playing tracks that we actually like are community.

872
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,680
You can just smile back home.

873
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:25,680
Just give on faces.

874
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,680
Of all those people come.

875
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:29,680
Just step on places.

876
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,680
And if they can't succeed,

877
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,680
with them all you cheat,

878
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,680
with a different due to play.

879
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,680
You've been sitting on a rainy day.

880
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,680
We hear the sky that's on.

881
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:46,680
We hear the sky that's on.

882
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,680
We hear it's been wasted.

883
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,680
We see it's been top of the past.

884
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,680
We're just playing spaces.

885
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,680
It's not more ever gone.

886
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:58,680
But it's too small apart.

887
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,680
By the height of all its dark.

888
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,680
To get through the fog.

889
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:06,680
Well, there was you, the blue.

890
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,680
We saw that you don't laugh.

891
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,680
You can't fall proud to see.

892
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,680
But on that song on this track.

893
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,680
I believe I'll rob your dreams.

894
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,680
I hear it out of the blue you've met.

895
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,680
It's nice to show your anger.

896
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,680
And get your hands on another plane.

897
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,680
I'll believe I'll rob your dreams.

898
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,680
I'm afraid to look like a man.

899
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,680
You're afraid to spend your money.

900
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:33,680
We get you started with another plane.

901
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,680
Looking for a kiss back home.

902
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,680
I believe so twisted.

903
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:45,680
When for the chase to start.

904
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,680
To be in delicious.

905
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,680
It's not far, ever gone.

906
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,680
But it's too small apart.

907
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,680
By the height of all its dark.

908
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:57,680
To get through the fog.

909
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,680
Well, there was you, the blue.

910
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:08,680
Make sure that you know I can't all try to smooth

911
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:11,680
Well, that's all one is glad

912
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:13,680
I'm going to run away dreams

913
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,680
I hear it out of a bogey man

914
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,680
It'll smash the show y'all mind

915
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,680
Can't y'all hear it to run on a plane

916
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,680
I'm going to run away dreams

917
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:25,680
I'm going to catch it back in the air

918
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,680
I'm going to finish the spary y'all mind

919
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,680
It's just starting y'all mind

920
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,680
I'm going to run away

921
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:37,680
I'm going to run away

922
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,680
I'm going to start the garbage night

923
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,680
Think I'll be home your time

924
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,680
So that I might live to see

925
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,680
All the living of my dreams

926
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:58,680
I'm going to be all around the dreams

927
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,680
I hear it out of a bogey man

928
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,680
It'll smash the show y'all mind

929
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:05,680
Can't y'all hear it to run on a plane

930
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:07,680
I'm going to run away dreams

931
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:12,680
I'm going to finish the spary y'all mind

932
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:16,680
Can't y'all hear it to run on a plane

933
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:21,680
I'm going to run away dreams

934
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:26,680
I'm going to run away dreams

935
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:28,680
I'm going to run away dreams

936
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,680
I really have pity on those poor DJs

937
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,680
Who sit there at radio station control centers

938
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,680
Playing out playlists put together by some music director

939
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,680
Program director telling them what to do

940
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,680
It's like repeats over and over again

941
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:44,680
All the same craft they're always having to play

942
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,680
Oh yeah, maybe it's five minutes difference

943
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,680
When they played it the day before

944
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,680
But when you look at the setup we've got here

945
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,680
But we have this drop box where I've got growl

946
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:57,680
Just to growl and I think the team he was leaving

947
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,680
I got something new here

948
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,680
Click on it opens up a new box

949
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:04,680
Wow, just fantastic craft from above

950
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:05,680
Love it

951
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:08,680
There is no better way to make radio

952
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:11,680
With the audience and the way we're doing it right now

953
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:12,680
Guarantee it

954
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:16,680
By the way, since radio got so fucked up by clear channel

955
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:18,680
Serious satellite radio we have real opportunity

956
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,680
Bring some back thing here

957
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,680
It's highly appreciated

958
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,680
The work everyone's doing

959
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:26,680
More about that company up here

960
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,680
And then the source code eight five seven

961
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:36,680
Turn down your speakers

962
01:24:53,680 --> 01:25:06,680
You got a body like a devil and you smell like sex

963
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:14,680
Like tell your trouble but I'm still obsessed

964
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:20,680
Because you know your soul

965
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,680
I want to get you low

966
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:27,680
And so I want to get you strong

967
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:31,680
And so I don't want to be your friend

968
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:36,680
I want to fuck you like I'm never gonna see you again

969
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,680
Yeah

970
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,680
Come on

971
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:55,680
You like the kiss of death

972
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,680
Like the hand of fate

973
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:06,680
I can tell your trouble but I still want to taste

974
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:11,680
Because you know your soul

975
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:14,680
I want to get you low

976
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:18,680
And so I want to get you strong

977
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:23,680
And so I don't want to be your friend

978
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:28,680
But you like I'm never gonna see you again

979
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,680
Yeah

980
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,680
Because you know your soul

981
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:48,680
I want to get you low

982
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:52,680
And so I want to get you strong

983
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:56,680
And so I don't want to be your friend

984
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:01,680
I want to fuck you like I'm never gonna see you again

985
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,680
You show the night

986
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,680
I want to get you low

987
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:11,680
And so I want to get you strong

988
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:12,680
And so I don't want to be your friend

989
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:15,680
Yeah, I think I've got 700 megabytes of kid rock

990
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,680
Streaming into the drop box

991
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,680
The sky is pretty good, it's hand to the hand

992
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,680
So hot, I'm a trolley

993
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,680
Life in origin is stream.com

994
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,680
And for those who tuning in late on the screen

995
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:27,680
And are looking for

996
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:29,680
previous episodes of the Daily Source Code

997
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,680
I've had a massive issue uploading the file

998
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:34,680
Sizes that these shows have become

999
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,680
I've tried uploading six or seven times

1000
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:38,680
It gets all the way to the end

1001
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,680
Then it says, oh, retry

1002
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,680
You know how long it takes to upload

1003
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:44,680
Like 350 megabytes

1004
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,680
Takes a little while

1005
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,680
Okay, so we're gonna see if I can figure that out

1006
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,680
I'm gonna put a call into Andrew Rubber

1007
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:52,680
I'm sure he's willing to help me out

1008
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:53,680
So I'm out

1009
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:56,680
See if we can get that fixed

1010
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,680
I know there's lots of people who love this

1011
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,680
Into these shows when we're not live as well

1012
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,680
Like a freight train man

1013
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:06,680
The shit keeps on coming

1014
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,680
And don't announcing it in the chat

1015
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,680
Thank you dog

1016
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:11,680

01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,680
We can go find her in

1019
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:15,680
Got no wrong dog

Hear what I've got

So?

So?

1052
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:39,680

1053
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:41,680
So?

1054
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:46,680

1055
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:51,680
I ain't got no mother, I ain't got no children

1056

1059
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:33,680
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1060
01:30:33,680 --> 01:31:03,680
yeah yeah yeah yeah

1061
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:25,780
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, like yeah yeah hey yeah that's how this cover music playing.

1062
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:40,680
So, let me tell you a little bit about what I'm experiencing here.

1063
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:46,320
I think, for those of you who heard the last live show, we talked about the new system

1064
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:51,360
that has been installed here at the Hilltop Watchtower Crackbox Command Center, something called

1065
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:59,800
the Audio Rack Suite ARS for short, and it's an open source, although a Mac base, but

1066
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:05,640
of course, really used the Unix part of the Macinton, three wrong system, which is the way

1067
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,360
the professional guys do it.

1068
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:12,880
You've got your music database, you've got your audio server, which is actually doing

1069
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:18,840
all, it's taking all the commands, the external commands, and playing out through the sound

1070
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:24,240
interface, the audio interfaces, and then you have a client which you can set up to do either

1071
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:29,360
automation, or you can do the live show like I'm doing it now, and it's an amazing

1072
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:33,920
system, because having work with some of the stuff that the big boys use, this really

1073
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,560
comes very, very close to doing exactly what that does, and it's open source, freely available.

1074
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:44,840
I've already taken some of the no agenda donation money, and donated it to their cause.

1075
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:48,840
They've got a PayPal, and of course, the source is available in open, so we could make

1076
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:50,560
it work on any type of machine.

1077
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,280
It's already kind of, I think, not quite sure what they programmed it in, but it could

1078
01:32:55,280 --> 01:33:02,280
be ported to anything, basically, it's got voice over IP systems built in, it's got

1079
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:09,720
that Asterix telephone exchange system that it can control it, it's really amazing, and

1080
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:15,360
what blew me away is it also has a MIDI interface for MIDI controller, and it's pre-programmed

1081
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:23,280
for a baranger, and I found a baranger BFC 2000 Fader control on Amazon for like 200

1082
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,280
bucks.

1083
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:28,480
And they've done it both way, so I've never had a MIDI controller that has the motorized

1084
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,760
faders, but this one does.

1085
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:38,520
So whenever I drag a new tune into the lineup, the faders snap to attention, and open

1086
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:44,720
right up, and then when a song is done, I take it out, it closes down, it is, it's horny,

1087
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:45,720
okay?

1088
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:52,160
It's absolutely fucking cool, and the fader, the control surface is the most expensive part

1089
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:59,160
of the entire system, I can love an admin, I need another beer, how about you guys?

1090
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:02,800
Seeing as I spilled half of my corona, I think I could have one more.

1091
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:07,880
I'll go get that and take quick wisdom to be back with you after black crows, twice as hard.

1092
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:12,880
Hey, hey, hey, come down your speakers!

1093
01:34:37,880 --> 01:35:07,880
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

1094
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:37,880
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh

1095
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:39,880
The blood will be

1096
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,880
The hot blood will never come

1097
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,880
Tell me, I'm alive

1098
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:56,880
And that's just our form

1099
01:35:57,880 --> 01:35:59,880
There's a world to pass by

1100
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,880
I said goodbye

1101
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:07,880
And that's just our form

1102
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,880
There's a world to pass by

1103
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,880
I said goodbye

1104
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:17,880
And that's one of everyone else

1105
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,880
Blow the rain for the day

1106
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:24,880
Climb in the wake of the night

1107
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:35,880
And that's just our form

1108
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:40,880
There's a world to pass by

1109
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:45,880
And that's just our form

1110
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:51,880
There's a world to pass by

1111
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:56,880
And that's just our form

1112
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:06,880
There's a world to pass by

1113
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:08,880
I said goodbye

1114
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:14,880
And that's just our form

1115
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:19,880
There's a world to pass by

1116
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:25,880
And that's just our form

1117
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,880
There's a world to pass by

1118
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,880
I said goodbye

1119
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,880
Short skirt, long jacket

1120
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:39,880
As well as coming up next for you

1121
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,880
Jog won't answer for sure

1122
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,880
Another one of those great things we important together here

1123
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:47,880
So anyway

1124
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:52,880
Thank you

1125
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:56,880
Alright, here's what came down this past week

1126
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:58,880
As I've installed the system

1127
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:04,880
I've been trying to figure out how best to expand upon the excellent idea set up

1128
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,880
I guess we initially started

1129
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,880
The daily source codes by sharing the drop boxes

1130
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:12,880
And then that was taken to a whole new level

1131
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:15,880
By get mostly working with GX2

1132
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:17,880
You can find these guys in the chat room whenever you want

1133
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,880
Almost seem to be there all the time at no agenda chat.net

1134
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:27,880
And the end Mr. Oil is like a big cabal in there

1135
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,880
And so they started putting together this stream

1136
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,880
Which consisted of people dropping box into an open source daily source code

1137
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,880
Dropbox and playing that out

1138
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,880
And it's a huge community effort which really is amazingly cool

1139
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:46,880
So I want to expand upon this and make it work 24-7

1140
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,880
Except of course we have live shows which would be no agenda

1141
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,880
Any source code I'd like to get more of those on the stream as well

1142
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:57,880
But there's a big difference between putting a couple hours together

1143
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,880
And really having something work 24-7

1144
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,880
And not going into too many repeats

1145
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,880
There's actually some science to it

1146
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:12,880
There's some art luckily with radio as we bring back the art of that globally

1147
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:16,880
And what's cool about this audio rack suite

1148
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:19,880
I don't think a lot of people that probably a lot of the human resources

1149
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,880
who are interested in this project have looked at the technical parts of it

1150
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:27,880
But if you look at the scheduler it allows you to have two different types of items

1151
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,880
One is a playlist

1152
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:32,880
And the other is a task

1153
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:34,880
And the task is very interesting

1154
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:38,880
In fact I'm going to open up the audio rack manager here for a minute

1155
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,880
And I'll tell you what kind of task you can have

1156
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,880
So if I were to start a new task

1157
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:49,880
I can have it being item-picked from a category from the database

1158
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:54,880
I can have it be an audio rack server command

1159
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:56,880
I have no idea what that is

1160
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:00,880
I'm sure it has some kind of scripting language which is not well documented yet

1161
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:04,880
You can run a shell command which is basically unix command

1162
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:06,880
This is really important

1163
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:08,880
And it can open up a file

1164
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:12,880
And I'm going to need the item-picked you can check for it

1165
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:14,880
You can pick something from a category

1166
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:17,880
You can do a SQL query on the database which is amazing

1167
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,880
So you could come up with all kinds of complicated queries

1168
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,880
To get just the right song and adjust the right moment

1169
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:27,880
Or you can pick something from a folder

1170
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:29,880
You have to select what the folder is

1171
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,880
And then you can say well I wanted to hear the options

1172
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:34,880
I'm going to read them to you

1173
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:36,880
Name starts with today's date

1174
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:39,880
Re-run last file played from this folder

1175
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:43,880
Next in alphabetical sequence from the last played in this folder

1176
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,880
It stores all the played information in its own database

1177
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:48,880
First in the alphabetical sequence from this folder

1178
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:50,880
And here's the one I've been using

1179
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:52,880
Random pick not played in the last

1180
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:54,880
And then you can fill in how many hours

1181
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:56,880
So you don't get too many repeats

1182
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:00,880
I've been using kind of like these macros that expand

1183
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:04,880
We have a playlist and the first thing in the playlist is okay

1184
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:08,880
I'm going to play something from the open source data source code Dropbox

1185
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:15,880
So I'm going to play a random sound file from the that I've pre-recorded

1186
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,880
Let me see if I have some examples of that here

1187
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:21,880
I actually am pretty sure I do a whole lot

1188
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,880
I'm going into the browser now the database browser

1189
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:29,880
So if I wanted to open source daily source code

1190
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,880
Open source daily source code IDs

1191
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:34,880
There's a five of them

1192
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:37,880
So I'll pick up a number one and

1193
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:39,880
Oops

1194
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,880
That went into queue

1195
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:43,880
How cool is that?

1196
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:45,880
I want a second

1197
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,880
I'll play that for you live now

1198
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:52,880
It's open source radio brought to you by no agenda stream.com

1199
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:56,880
With music now directly from open source daily source code Dropbox

1200
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:59,880
Right so that has a seg time of like two seconds

1201
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:01,880
And then it'll pick a song at random

1202
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:03,880
That has not been repeated in X amount of hours

1203
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:06,880
I've been trying to do like 15 hours kind of like it

1204
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:08,880
You know halfway through the clock there

1205
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:10,880
And then it'll pick that song

1206
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:12,880
And that's actually been working quite well

1207
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,880
There are some problems like if it can't find a song

1208
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,880
Because it's already played all the songs in the Dropbox

1209
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:22,880
Then it'll pick something else that's next on the list

1210
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:25,880
And it'll still play that sound file making it all sound fucked up

1211
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,880
So there's all kinds of things that are going on here

1212
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:31,880
Then I'm trying to figure out at the same time

1213
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,880
I want to be able to have people just throw stuff into a box

1214
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,880
And at a set time let's say so I've been testing this with GX2

1215
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:41,880
I tried it yesterday so a 330

1216
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:45,880
He had he just threw some files into a Dropbox folder

1217
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:50,880
He named them as 010203 all the way up to 20 whatever was

1218
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:52,880
Excuse me and

1219
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:59,880
Just before it's time to play that playlist a shell script runs again set up automatically by the system

1220
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:05,880
Which is NJSF shell script and it goes in creates a playlist that play list is then played

1221
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:11,880
And I worked a couple times then we didn't work so this is so much mind-bending crap going on

1222
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:16,880
That it's exactly that it's mind-bending but we're going to figure all of this out

1223
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:21,880
And I'm thinking you know in the next few weeks we'll have most of these things worked

1224
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:25,880
I will have a real schedule and of course there's another little interesting tid bit here

1225
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:30,880
Is that everyone who's working on this is not just in one place

1226
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:38,880
Radio is typically a community a geographic community like New York or Los Angeles or PoDunk or whatever it is

1227
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:43,880
So now we have it makes no real sense to say well, let's have this type of music in the morning

1228
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:47,880
Because where's it where's it in the morning somewhere but not everywhere at the same time

1229
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:52,880
So we've got to figure out all these things and I'm just I'm soaking up like a sponge

1230
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:57,880
I'm taking all of the input that I can get and trying to make this into something that actually works

1231
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:05,880
But I have to say what's so beautiful is everybody is working on this and and contributing in their own way

1232
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:10,880
Whenever they can and so it's so sometimes it's very unclear what's happening

1233
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:16,880
The stream burps and farts and pukes and stops and starts and there's all kinds of stuff going on

1234
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:20,880
But we're going to get it right or we're going to get it a lot more right than it is today

1235
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:25,880
And it's going to be ours, okay, it's going to be fucking ours and I can't wait

1236
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,880
It's going to be so awesome

1237
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:35,880
And I won't be the one to control we can all control it

1238
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:07,880
With a jewelry, she's putting up her hair, she's doing the facility and picking up a slack

1239
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:14,880
I want to go with a short skirt and a long jacket

1240
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:28,880
I want to girl who gets up early

1241
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:32,880
I want to girl who stays up late

1242
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:41,880
I want to girl with uninterrupted prosperity who uses a machete to cut through red tape

1243
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:48,880
With the nails that shine like justice and a voice that is dark like tidied glass

1244
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:57,880
She is fast, her own and sharp as a tack she is touring the facility and picking up a slack

1245
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:07,880
I want to girl with the short skirt and a long jacket

1246
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:16,880
I want a girl with a smooth and good day

1247
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:40,880
I want a girl with a smooth and good day

1248
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:49,880
I want a girl with good dividends that city bank we will meet accidentally

1249
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:53,880
We'll start to talk when she borrows my pen

1250
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:57,880
She wants a car with the cup holder arrest

1251
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,880
She wants a car that will get her the hour

1252
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:05,880
She's changing her name from kitty to car

1253
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:18,880
She's trading her age for a ride, quite similar for her and I want to girl with the short skirt and a long jacket

1254
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:42,880
I want a girl with the short skirt and a long jacket

1255
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:54,880
You see I know you're not real man because I'm loaded okay

1256
01:47:55,880 --> 01:48:00,880
I've had some experience in that area besides that whole wrap yours is full anyway good

1257
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:09,880
I saw the same crap rock and roll is the only thing that counts dig hard as blistering awesome heavy metal rock and roll

1258
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:33,880
Got dreams of both sides, got the bottom of my name

1259
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:37,880
Car in the red place to men and lead

1260
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:41,880
I'm a professional cynic but my heart's not needed

1261
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:44,880
I'm bringing the price up that black pack that's in the fair

1262
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:50,880
Car in the center of the city, yes it breaks on hand

1263
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:55,880
I'm bringing the price up that black pack that's in the fair

1264
01:48:55,880 --> 01:49:00,880
I'm bringing the price up that black pack that's in the fair

1265
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:04,880
I'm bringing the price up that black pack that's in the fair

1266
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:09,880
I'm bringing the price up that black pack that's in the fair

1267
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:12,880
I'm bringing the price up that black pack that's in the fair

1268
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,880
I'm bringing the price up that black pack that's in the fair

1269
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:18,880
These got more lane-clawia lights and different scoring

1270
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:22,880
Every thing's the way Jack gets your hands out

1271
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:25,880
Drivers out more, tell us that

1272
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:29,880
He's raging, oh sign, don't get that price up

1273
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:32,880
It's a helping hand, the make sure fill it up your eyes

1274
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:35,880
Oh, this is a trade remedy

1275
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:40,880
But the price is full, it's time to tell us

1276
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:45,880
I'm just so close to the house, so may they pass me the country

1277
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:51,880
He's got the phone in his chest, so he needs a lot of rest in the country

1278
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:56,880
He doesn't mix what a black pack's got, the boss in the country

1279
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:02,880
Such a close-up on the number of arm in the country

1280
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:08,880
In the country, in the country

1281
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:11,880
In the country

1282
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:16,880

He's raging, oh sign, don't get that price up

1300
01:51:31,880 --> 01:52:01,880
It's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a country, it's a

You think around, I'll make you put your word

1303
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:36,880
No one's beat on what you give down

1304
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:38,880
Be with me, cause it's over set

1305
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,880
Down, down, down, down

1306
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,880
I says, anyway, because you made one of it

1307
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:43,880
Who's out?

1308
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:45,880
From the hud you never had to find out

1309
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:47,880
I was the mayor's wall to the very last night

1310
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:49,880
We're looking about a week, I'll feel broke up

1311
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:52,880
People always say, my silence, why?

1312
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:54,880
You've got gold, you've got gold

1313
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:55,880
Got gold, got gold, got gold

1314
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:56,880
I'm a rival, five

1315
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:59,880
And you wanna never go into the night

1316
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:01,880
Come in for me, it is too tick for us

1317
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:03,880
Don't walk in for my props, I'll jump

1318
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:06,880
Can't sleep, walk in too, hey, stop

1319
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:09,880
I'm a DJ, I'm a DJ, I'm a DJ

I'm a DJ, I'm a DJ

1323
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:17,880
Jazz and A wall, that's okay

1324
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:19,880
Stepping down the body, this rock the whole scene

1325
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:22,880
When it comes to beach, where I'm off the, I like my shoulder

1326
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,880
We're going to be agreed

1327
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:25,880
I'm gonna keep it going, keep it going full

1328
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:28,880
Say, sweet to be so, to rise to be me

1329
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,880
I'm a talker, style, I'm not too key

1330
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,880
Trying to change the world, I'm a club, you're a skim

1331
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,880
Mario, say, like to keep it, great

1332
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,880
I wanna shine like gay, so, baby

1333
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:39,880
But, rather, because that's my dream

1334
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:41,880
Dream, dream, more deep, for a stage

1335
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:42,880

I despise

1375
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:03,880
Costing me a destruction of this life

1376
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:06,880
What me is dead

1377
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:08,880
The thousands of mothers are dead

1378
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:10,880
When their sons go to fight

1379
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,880
And lose their lives

1380
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:14,880
I stand in war

1381
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:17,880
Good God, y'all

1382
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:18,880
What do you think is good

1383
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,880
But I absolutely

1384
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,880
Let's get out of here

1385
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:24,880
Wow

1386
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,880
It's good

What a hard day

1390
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:37,880
Wow, it ain't only

1391
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:39,880
To the Undertaker

1392
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:40,880
Oh, wow

1393
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:43,880
This is an enemy to open

1394
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:46,880
The bottom of war home

1395
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:48,880
Low was found

1396
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:51,880
One constant risk

1397
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:53,880
Within the hundreds of generations

1398
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:55,880
And the shit, the destruction

1399
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:57,880
Who was the death?

1400
01:56:57,880 --> 01:56:58,880
Oh, wow

1401
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,880
Good God, y'all

1402
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:03,880

Wow, it ain't nothing

1409
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:21,880
Fire, I have one breath

1410
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:22,880
It's an enemy to untake

1411
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:24,880
Ow, wow

1412
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:26,880
It's injured

1413
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:28,880
A million big dreams

1414
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:30,880
Made into safer

1415
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:36,880
Madder and me

1416
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:39,280
Kindness must be shutting patches

1417
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:40,880
It's been fighting for three days

1418
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:43,880
I can't keep life

1419
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:45,880
Good God, y'all

1420
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:47,880
What?

1421
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:50,880
Perhaps you look at the shit again

1422
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,880
What?

1423
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:54,880
Who are you?

1424
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:56,880
What is it good for?

1425
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:57,880
Absolutely.

1426
01:57:57,880 --> 01:57:59,880
Listen to me.

1427
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:00,880
What?

1428
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:03,880
Nothing but a hard break.

1429
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:04,880
What?

1430
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:07,880
Bring only the hunter taker.

1431
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:08,880
What?

1432
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:11,880
She's coming after me.

1433
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:12,880
Tell me.

1434
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,880
It is not complete.

1435
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:15,880
Believe me.

1436
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:19,880
They say we must find.

1437
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:22,880
To keep our freedom alone.

1438
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:25,880
No, this can't be open away.

1439
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:27,880
Oh, wow.

1440
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:29,880
Sonio.

1441
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:31,880
What is it good for?

1442
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:32,880
You tell me.

1443
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:34,880
Just answer it.

1444
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:35,880
Say it.

1445
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:36,880
What?

1446
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:38,880
Good for me.

1447
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:40,880
What is it?

1448
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:45,880
This is my special moment to shine in the spotlight.

1449
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:48,880
A pretty young thing right here to rock the light.

1450
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:49,880
Rock the point.

1451
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:51,880
Like I know you do it right.

1452
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:52,880
Yeah.

1453
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:53,880
Rock the point.

1454
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:56,880
Like you do it all the way.

1455
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:57,880
Run it.

1456
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:58,880
But with the high light.

1457
01:58:58,880 --> 01:58:59,880
We break all the shaking.

1458
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:00,880
It's for you, but the loop.

1459
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:01,880
We don't shock your mind.

1460
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:03,880
With the sensation, we guess the loop.

1461
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:04,880
Wasn't real.

1462
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:05,880
We love you.

1463
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:06,880
See the brand clown taking you down.

1464
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:07,880
No fun.

1465
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:08,880
I got the boxing.

1466
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,880
It's for my wonder clown taking you to bellows.

1467
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,880
But now I've found it like a all-requim pension.

1468
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:13,880
But look me and found it wrong.

1469
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:14,880
Don't tell me.

1470
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:15,880
Tell me, tell me.

1471
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:16,880
Tell me.

1472
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:17,880
Brown man.

1473
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:18,880

My special moment to shine in the spotlight.

1475
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:22,880
A pretty young thing right here to rock the light.

1476
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:23,880
Rock the point.

1477
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:25,880
Like I know you do it right.

1478
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:27,880
Rock the point.

1479
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:30,880
Like you do it all the way.

1480
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:32,880
We have all schools.

1481
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:33,880
You go, come on.

1482
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:35,880

Apparently, from a glee album, which strikes me just a little bit, but you know, you never know what's going to show me in Dropbox. So this is the way it works.

By the way

1587
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:57,080
Easy, run, stand

1588
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:03,080
You don't have to wear the dress tonight

1589
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:06,680
Run, run, stand

1590
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:12,480
You don't have to wear the dress tonight

1591
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:17,880
You don't have to wear the dress tonight

1592
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:20,080
I'm not a fan

1593
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:22,880
I'm not a fan

1594
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:24,880
I'm not a fan

1595
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:27,880
I'm not a fan

1596
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:29,880
I'm not a fan

1597
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:32,880
I'm not a fan

1598
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:40,080
All right, line of the show

1599
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:42,080
Plot two says

1600
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:45,080
This is staying with the ball gag and gimp suits

1601
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:47,080
Sitting in the basement waiting for hold fictions

1602
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:49,080
Marcus to get medieval on his ass

1603
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:51,080
Totally right wrong

1604
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:53,080
And it can't all be gentle

1605
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:55,080
They come into the drop box

1606
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:58,080
What you got to do when you're looking at open source radio

1607
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:01,080
All right, yes, another hit from the 80s

1608
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:03,080
How does that sound for?

1609
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:04,080
It's kind of where I come from

1610
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:07,080
It's where I'm going to bring it to you now

1611
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:10,080
I'm gonna make it work for your football

1612
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:13,080
Now I'm just going to go to 8.57

1613
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:17,080
You're gonna be knocking at my door

1614
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:19,080
Go away

1615
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:21,080
Don't come down here no more

1616
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:24,080
That you see that it's late at night

1617
02:09:24,080 --> 02:09:26,080
Every time

1618
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:29,080
And I'm not feeling right

1619
02:09:29,080 --> 02:09:32,080
All I wish is to be alone

1620
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:34,080
Stay away

1621
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:36,080
Don't you want to get my home

1622
02:09:36,080 --> 02:09:39,080
Best out if you hang outside

1623
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:41,080
Don't come in

1624
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:43,080
I'll only run and hide

1625
02:09:43,080 --> 02:09:46,080
You can't even know

1626
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:50,080
You can't even know

1627
02:09:51,080 --> 02:09:53,080
You can't even know

1628
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:58,080
You can't even know

1629
02:09:58,080 --> 02:10:00,080
You can't even know

1630
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:01,080
You can't even know

1631
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:03,080
You can't even know

1632
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:04,080
You can't even know

1633
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:08,080
You can't even know

1634
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:09,080
You can't even know

1635
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:10,080
You can't even know

1636
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:12,080
You can't even know

1637
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:14,080
You can't even know

1638
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:16,080
You can't even know

1639
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:18,080
You can't even know

1640
02:10:18,080 --> 02:10:19,080
You can't even know

1641
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:20,080
You can't even know

1642
02:10:20,080 --> 02:10:22,080
You can't even know

1643
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:25,080
And here with my child's friend

1644
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:27,080
Here they come

1645
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:29,080
Who's feelings of him?

1646
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:32,080
Who can it be now?

1647
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:36,080
Who can it be now?

1648
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:40,080
Who can it be now?

1649
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:43,080
Who can it be now?

1650
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:47,080
Is that the man who comes to take me away?

1651
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:50,080
Why do they follow me?

1652
02:10:51,080 --> 02:10:54,080
It's not the future that I can see

1653
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:57,080
It's just not fantasy

1654
02:11:20,080 --> 02:11:29,080
Who can it be now?

1655
02:11:29,080 --> 02:11:35,080
Who can it be now?

1656
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:40,080
Who can it be now?

1657
02:11:40,080 --> 02:11:47,080
Who can it be now?

1658
02:11:47,080 --> 02:12:01,640
I met at work who are probably swimming at work these days, let's get one nation down

1659
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:05,200
under his body.

1660
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:07,640
Who can't be now?

1661
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:11,680
By the way, I do need to give out massive props to Sir Walter, who has been working with

1662
02:12:11,680 --> 02:12:17,360
get most slave on keeping the entire box clean where we're talking about the open source

1663
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:23,000
daily source code folder on the Dropbox, big props to him.

1664
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:27,240
And I think Rhino the beard has a message for me, he's dropped about 8 million tracks

1665
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:29,280
into his box, so this one's from him.

1666
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:33,840
Well, let's a hot, so let's a hot, so let's a hot, so let's take a flight and miss a lot

1667
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:39,120
to keep your hand above the water sea, it seems to order again, the more freedom my

1668
02:12:39,120 --> 02:12:45,240
hair, whatever thing is complicated to me, what's about to bend at teeth, pack and take

1669
02:12:45,240 --> 02:12:50,400
his dress, oh my pocket, oh my back, before the snap and break, no one has to elevate

1670
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:54,640
rob my face, take it's up the high, it's random ramen, no one to sit, it's trees

1671
02:12:54,640 --> 02:12:59,120
don't rip them, they're my freakest snakes, they've reached top and bottom down, don't

1672
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:05,560
reach off myself, can't wait the breath and that will cut the lives, take a long drive

1673
02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:10,760
because I'm still alive enough to pressure the enemy in, we'll get them in there, stay

1674
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:21,040
high as the sky, and watch the fuck out, cause playing is a hassle, running is a hassle,

1675
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:27,480
everything's a hassle, but love, nothing is a hassle, I'm the rock and never miss a

1676
02:13:27,480 --> 02:13:39,160
man, you're just trying to keep your head up, keep your head up, oh, the music is the thing

1677
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:43,520
I always made me high, and miss the warmth that left the life that never told no

1678
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:49,000
blocks, and miss the feeling in my heart, and the tears in my mouth, and the chill in my

1679
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:53,200
stomach, and the freedom of my mind, and miss the molt of that, I can't get no more

1680
02:13:53,200 --> 02:13:58,560
getting back, and it's forget for brought for something, then I'll pay the back, but if I get

1681
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:05,560
for it, you won't that forgive me, won't please don't put no evil on me, cause I'm still

1682
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:11,560
not the worth of for my father, and I'm not trying to make my way in the world, you see

1683
02:14:11,560 --> 02:14:41,560
you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see

1684
02:14:41,560 --> 02:15:11,560
you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see you see, you very little you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see you see

1685
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:34,560
I don't cool you. The second best thing you can do by yourself.

1686
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:40,560
In the morning.

1687
02:15:45,560 --> 02:15:52,560
Roll up. Roll up again. Roll up.

1688
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:58,560
Right in front of my friends. I was rocking like a star.

1689
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:03,560
So down all the bars. Now I'm sitting in this poor place.

1690
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:11,560
Step up through the lightning. Don't get me out of jail.

1691
02:16:11,560 --> 02:16:18,560
Please, please. You're my only friend that I know.

1692
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:23,560
Who's got something to live? Who's my babe?

1693
02:16:23,560 --> 02:16:31,560
She's so rich. Always dreams.

1694
02:16:31,560 --> 02:16:36,560
We've been hard to fight to keep my rules.

1695
02:16:36,560 --> 02:16:41,560
I don't got no fun or break-outs in yous.

1696
02:16:41,560 --> 02:16:46,560
And it's late at night that this girl left us. Gonna have to do it too.

1697
02:16:46,560 --> 02:16:53,560
Step up through the lightning. Don't get me out of jail.

1698
02:16:53,560 --> 02:17:00,560
Please, please. You're my only friend that I know.

1699
02:17:00,560 --> 02:17:06,560
Who's got something to live? Who's my babe?

1700
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:21,560
You're my only friend that I know. Who's my babe?

1701
02:17:21,560 --> 02:17:26,560
You're my only friend that I know. Who's got something to live?

1702
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:31,560
You're my only friend that I know. Who's got something to live? Who's got something to live?

1703
02:17:31,560 --> 02:17:36,560
You're my only friend that I know. Who's got something to live?

1704
02:17:36,560 --> 02:17:43,560
You're my only friend that I know. Who's got something to live?

1705
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:47,560
You're my only friend that I know. Who's got something to live?

1706
02:17:47,560 --> 02:17:51,560
You're my only friend that I know. Who's got something to live?

1707
02:17:51,560 --> 02:17:56,560
You're my only friend that I know. Who's got something to live?

1708
02:17:56,560 --> 02:17:59,560
You're my only friend that I know. Who's got something to live?

1709
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:03,560
You're my only friend that I know. Who's got something to live?

1710
02:18:03,560 --> 02:18:09,560
You're my only friend that I know. Who's got something to live?

1711
02:18:09,560 --> 02:18:13,560
You're my only friend that I know. Who's got something to live?

1712
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:23,560
You're my only friend that I know. Who's got something to live?

1713
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:25,560
You're my only friend that I know. Who's got something to live?

1714
02:18:25,560 --> 02:18:30,560
You're my only friend that I know. Who's got something to live?

1715
02:18:30,560 --> 02:18:51,560
It's a wonderful little surprising box who's got, I love to root around in it as much as I possibly can.

1716
02:18:51,560 --> 02:18:59,560
And that goes from most of the human resources supplied songs that we play on the show, it's really, it's quite unbelievable.

1717
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:02,560
There was a lot of crazy stuff.

1718
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:03,560
Hi, yes.

1719
02:19:03,560 --> 02:19:08,560
So, as I was saying earlier about the whole entire system the way we have it set up.

1720
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:15,560
Here are some of the pitfalls that come into play where you can have something that is automatically scheduled to play,

1721
02:19:15,560 --> 02:19:20,560
and then it's a shared drop box with more than one person, or maybe the person who owns it decides,

1722
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:25,560
well, I'm going to take that song out, and it could be scheduled to play, and you take it out,

1723
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:31,560
or you just put a new one in the system recognizes a file name, but it's not completely loaded yet.

1724
02:19:31,560 --> 02:19:34,560
There's all kinds of parameters that need to be looked at.

1725
02:19:34,560 --> 02:19:38,560
So, again, that's why from time to time you go, what just happened there?

1726
02:19:38,560 --> 02:19:41,560
Why did it hear two things at once? Why did something play for a second and then stop?

1727
02:19:41,560 --> 02:19:49,560
All that stuff we're going to figure out, and once we do it, we're going to have something so incredibly cool.

1728
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:53,560
And of course, none of this works without the human element.

1729
02:19:53,560 --> 02:20:00,560
That's what I like the most about it, is we have to have humans, human resources that we call them, programming their boxes.

1730
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:02,560
Oh yeah, work on your box, baby!

1731
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:06,560
I'm making that and you're going to heaven, because it was kind of half-delivered,

1732
02:20:06,560 --> 02:20:10,560
but I want to say to be in a team out of night home.

1733
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:14,560
I got across a mountain stand out, I'm not dance, I see what's left of it.

1734
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:18,560
I think my skin that she was from, I'm not the time.

1735
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:22,560
I like some baby, but my gorilla, and with the stars, it's her gorilla.

1736
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:28,560
She asked me, if I'd like to magnetize, do I have to go start drinking?

1737
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:34,560
Because it's yours, you're a chicken, but socialize will be now with her cosmic eyes.

1738
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:36,560
Oh yeah!

1739
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:39,560
She's just a cosmic girl.

1740
02:20:39,560 --> 02:20:41,560
Oh yeah!

1741
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:48,560
From a knock-a-gallet scene, my heart's at zero gravity.

1742
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:52,560
She's more of my cosmic world.

1743
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:57,560
Oh, what do I have to go start drinking?

1744
02:20:57,560 --> 02:21:00,560
She's been in my briefcase.

1745
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:03,560
Oh, what do I have to go start drinking?

1746
02:21:03,560 --> 02:21:05,560
Oh yeah!

1747
02:21:11,560 --> 02:21:30,560
I'm skinned on my radar, when she's set, she's from a quiz, I've afforded thousands of millions, like kids away, hey

1748
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:38,560
It's a distant solar system, try to foam, but they don't list them, so I asked if I remember, I would say him

1749
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:46,560
If she said, I'll still be much more important, so I can turn aboard you, I hear my head on your body

1750
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:56,560
This could be a close and killer, I should take it, not to flutter, sense it and I hide this piece, when I see her pretty face

1751
02:21:57,560 --> 02:22:01,560
She's just a cause and a girl

1752
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:13,560
When I'm not again, I see her, my heart's in her belly, she's from a cause and a girl

1753
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:25,560
In the end, next to sea, I'm trying to know my frequency, she's cause and a girl

1754
02:22:25,560 --> 02:22:29,560
I see her, my heart's in her belly, she's from a cause and a girl

1755
02:22:30,560 --> 02:22:34,560
I see her, my heart's in her belly, she's from a cause and a girl

1756
02:22:35,560 --> 02:22:39,560
I see her, my heart's in her belly, she's from a cause and a girl

1757
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:45,560
I see her, my heart's in her belly, she's from a cause and a girl

1758
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:51,560
I see her, my heart's in her belly, she's from a cause and a girl

1759
02:22:51,560 --> 02:23:01,560
I see her, my heart's in her belly, she's from a cause and a girl

1760
02:23:02,560 --> 02:23:05,560
She's just a cause and a girl

1761
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:12,560
When I'm not again, I see her, my heart's in her belly, she's from a cause and a girl

1762
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:42,480
I just kind of like that guy at JK from Jemeraquai and I know how successful they are I think you've made like a ton of money

1763
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:48,640
like it really did extremely well for himself, bought a whole bunch of cars and I hope you still making some tunes

1764
02:23:48,640 --> 02:23:52,160
I really liked hearing that when I was pretty cool

1765
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:57,680
Cosmic girl on your daily source code episode 8 5 7 now over to the M people moving on up

1766
02:23:59,920 --> 02:24:04,960

Take it like a man baby, give this what you are, cause I'm moving on up

1773

You're moving on up, moving on up, no they can stop me, moving on up, you're moving on up

1774
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:52,000
Time to break the rain, no they can stop me

1775
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:06,480
They brought a man, he has what to spend, but you can't even find my place

1776
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:09,440
There ain't nothing, you can do

1777

1786
02:27:04,640 --> 02:27:07,160
If we want to have a good time, that's the way we're going to do it.

1787
02:27:07,160 --> 02:27:08,160
What are you going to do?

1788
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:10,160
We're going to have a good time.

1789
02:27:10,160 --> 02:27:11,640

One way, they want to go.

1797
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:08,760
I don't know what to do with it now

1798
02:31:08,760 --> 02:31:13,760
I don't know what to do with it now

1799
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:36,760
We want to be free to do it

1800
02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:17,760
We want to be free to do it

1801
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:35,760

02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:37,760
We want to be free to do it

02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:39,760
We want to be free to do it

1804
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:41,760
We want to be free to do it

1805
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:43,760
We want to be free to do it

1806
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:45,760
We want to be free to do it

1807
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:47,760
We want to be free to do it

1808
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:49,760
We want to be free to do it

1809
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:51,760

1812
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:57,760
We want to be free to do it

1813
02:32:57,760 --> 02:32:59,760
We want to be free to do it

1814
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:01,760
We want to be free to do it

1815
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:03,760
We want to be free to do it

1816
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:05,760

We want to be free to do it

1822
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:59,560
Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language

1823
02:33:59,560 --> 02:34:09,560
is the word fuck. Out of all of the English words that begin with a letter F, fuck is the only word that is referred to as the F word.

1824
02:34:09,560 --> 02:34:17,560
It's the one magic word, just by a sound, can describe pain, pleasure, hate and love.

1825
02:34:17,560 --> 02:34:24,560
Fuck as most words in the English language derived from German, the word, written with a meaning.

1826
02:34:24,560 --> 02:34:28,560
In English, what calls and how many grammatical categories?

1827
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:31,560
It's a tragedy for a friend.

1828
02:34:31,560 --> 02:34:33,560
Short, but fairly.

1829
02:34:33,560 --> 02:34:36,560
I can't take it for a fairly much.

1830
02:34:36,560 --> 02:34:39,560
The meaning is not always that cool.

1831
02:34:39,560 --> 02:34:41,560
You can be used as an adjective, such as,

1832
02:34:41,560 --> 02:34:43,560
beyond doing all the fucking work.

1833
02:34:43,560 --> 02:34:45,560
And more than ever,

1834
02:34:45,560 --> 02:34:48,560
surely probably don't work much.

1835
02:34:48,560 --> 02:34:51,560
As an adverb in handling an attitude,

1836
02:34:52,560 --> 02:34:56,560
It's a tear, the Imperial Guildman talks to him because the crowd,

1837
02:34:56,560 --> 02:35:01,560
I don't fear the party like why he is such a psychopath.

1838
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:03,560
I'm like how do I do Dad?

1839
02:35:03,560 --> 02:35:05,560
called he is my wife!

1840
02:35:05,560 --> 02:35:09,560
Please don't try to steal your word.

1841
02:35:09,560 --> 02:35:13,560
Even though I don't have a word but I must answer something in the manual.

1842
02:35:13,560 --> 02:35:16,560
So why don't you do that.

1843
02:35:17,560 --> 02:35:18,560
Who did you think you were?

02:35:18,560 --> 02:35:48,560

1853
02:39:48,560 --> 02:40:03,360

1854
02:40:03,360 --> 02:40:12,360
I don't think I've heard this track in 20 years, is that possible?

1855
02:40:12,360 --> 02:40:15,360
Rick Springfield, Bob, to you drop, coming from the drop box.

1856
02:40:15,360 --> 02:40:16,360
There you go.

1857
02:40:16,360 --> 02:40:19,360
That's how we roll in the daily source code.

1858
02:40:19,360 --> 02:40:22,360
The Fubar Friday edition is now time for a little DJ's choice,

1859
02:40:22,360 --> 02:40:25,360
as I get to roll some of my favorite tunes.

1860
02:40:25,360 --> 02:40:28,360
All selected from your collections, of course.

1861
02:40:28,360 --> 02:40:30,360
Is Jance?

1862
02:40:30,360 --> 02:40:39,360
Baby, when times are bad, all on me don't,

1863
02:40:39,360 --> 02:40:46,360
and I'll come to you when you're in trouble,

1864
02:40:46,360 --> 02:40:52,360
and see you are still sad, all on me don't,

1865
02:40:52,360 --> 02:40:57,360
but I call on you and I'll help you.

1866
02:40:58,360 --> 02:41:04,360
I'm a man and a woman, happy German baby.

1867
02:41:06,360 --> 02:41:11,360
She's found their way, and is wild.

1868
02:41:13,360 --> 02:41:19,360
I need you, darling, like the fish need to see.

1869
02:41:20,360 --> 02:41:24,360
Don't drink, your sweet love for me.

1870
02:41:25,360 --> 02:41:28,360
Darling, when you're down,

1871
02:41:29,360 --> 02:41:33,360
and feel so full,

1872
02:41:33,360 --> 02:41:34,360
you know you won't drown,

1873
02:41:34,360 --> 02:41:38,360
and I know you won't, like I'll feel that too.

1874
02:41:40,360 --> 02:41:42,360
You're not alone,

1875
02:41:43,360 --> 02:41:47,360
I'm not there too,

1876
02:41:47,360 --> 02:41:50,360
I'll have a young trouble's eye,

1877
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:53,360
I'm Ketch,

1878
02:41:56,360 --> 02:42:00,360
and a woman, happy German baby.

1879
02:42:02,360 --> 02:42:07,360
She's found their way, and is wild.

1880
02:42:10,360 --> 02:42:16,360
I need you, darling, like the fish need to see.

1881
02:42:16,360 --> 02:42:20,360
Don't take your sweet sweet love for me

1882
02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:24,360
I know, please

1883
02:42:25,360 --> 02:42:29,360
I'm not so sad

1884
02:42:30,360 --> 02:42:32,360
All on me, darling

1885
02:42:32,360 --> 02:42:35,360
Just call on me

1886
02:42:35,360 --> 02:42:38,360
Aw man, Janice, what are you going to say?

1887
02:42:38,360 --> 02:42:42,360
This is an alternative take of the song called on me

1888
02:42:43,360 --> 02:42:46,360
Something you certainly won't hear on your regular radio stations

1889
02:42:47,360 --> 02:42:50,360
Because it just doesn't fit in with a commercial program

1890
02:42:51,360 --> 02:42:52,360
Nature of the way they work

1891
02:42:53,360 --> 02:42:55,360
Hey boy, I'm feeling those two suvasas

1892
02:42:56,360 --> 02:42:59,360
And it's been a long ass week, you know what I'm saying?

1893
02:43:00,360 --> 02:43:03,360
Little JJ K, K to move, no Charlie

1894
02:43:13,360 --> 02:43:16,360
You took my bait, wait too soon

1895
02:43:17,360 --> 02:43:19,360
What have you done?

1896
02:43:20,360 --> 02:43:23,360
Gaging my, some day bait

1897
02:43:24,360 --> 02:43:26,360
What you want to make

1898
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:30,360
And if I need no, just like me

1899
02:43:31,360 --> 02:43:35,360
Don't tell me man, why every you do?

1900
02:43:36,360 --> 02:43:40,360
Gaging my, took him from you

1901
02:43:41,360 --> 02:43:45,360
Gaging my, what does your power?

1902
02:43:46,360 --> 02:43:50,360
Have you moved across the southern sky?

1903
02:43:51,360 --> 02:43:54,360
You took my bait, wait too soon

1904
02:43:55,360 --> 02:43:56,360
What have you done?

1905
02:43:57,360 --> 02:44:00,360
Gaging my, some day bait

1906
02:44:10,360 --> 02:44:12,360
And they lil like me, and baby

1907
02:44:13,360 --> 02:44:23,360
And they lil like me, and I Malcolm K, you're getting alarmed

1908
02:44:23,360 --> 02:44:28,360
Sheila, you are not this song

1909
02:44:28,360 --> 02:44:30,360
Don't try to keep mad. Why do you do?

1910
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:34,360
By the way, what have you got me?

1911
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:36,360
There are no worries

1912
02:44:36,360 --> 02:44:39,360
For radio music directors you can do this kind of stuff

1913
02:44:39,360 --> 02:44:47,440
together amazing plantless stuff that draw audiences. I don't think they could make enough statues.

1914
02:44:48,720 --> 02:44:51,600
For all of the human resources who were involved in this project.

1915
02:44:52,960 --> 02:44:59,360
Ah yes, our favorite number. The one we know works everywhere, the one that keeps throwing our faces.

1916
02:45:09,360 --> 02:45:13,760
We're going through real-est of it. And that's the magic number.

1917
02:45:15,360 --> 02:45:19,200
Typical preaching is possibly a pleasure. Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart.

1918
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:23,200
Something that stimulates the music in the measure. Measure in the music. Graces in the heart.

1919
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:26,080
Casually see, but don't do like the soul. Cousin and doing.

1920
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:29,120
But actions, so monkeys. Doing hip-hop hustle, no rock and roll.

1921
02:45:29,120 --> 02:45:31,200
Unless your name's Brusta, because Brusta's a parry.

1922
02:45:31,200 --> 02:45:33,200
Hands like gold, because magic in the air.

1923
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:35,200
Try to stop and rap, so you're out of order.

1924
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:37,920
Stop looking listen to the phrase in front of stairs and don't get the finger

1925
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:41,120
where I may still see those jadeurs. I try camera-rolls. This one is not set.

1926
02:45:41,120 --> 02:45:43,120
Fly around the store on the days. You've got to touch it.

1927
02:45:43,120 --> 02:45:46,080
This dance would have in a sound. You're going to get the action, not a trick.

1928
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:50,480
But show me the orange. Everybody wants to beat all the DJ. Everybody wants to beat it.

1929
02:45:50,480 --> 02:45:54,240
We'll see what being speakers of the best. And you don't have to guess.

1930
02:45:54,240 --> 02:45:56,080
You get a self-pussy, because it's good.

1931
02:45:56,080 --> 02:45:57,680
Three and that's the magic number.

1932
02:45:58,720 --> 02:46:02,480
Three, this is piece of the pie. It's not the strength of the cost that we've done.

1933
02:46:02,480 --> 02:46:04,320
And we gotta bet we're done time.

1934
02:46:04,320 --> 02:46:07,040
The effect is, well, the days you don't think am I.

1935
02:46:07,040 --> 02:46:11,680
Showing true position, this hippie is kissing the pot of the pot, as missing.

1936
02:46:11,680 --> 02:46:14,160
With a negative number, fills up the casualty.

1937
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:19,040
Maybe you can subtract it. You can call it to lucky partner.

1938
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:21,200
Maybe you can call it to adjective.

1939
02:46:22,800 --> 02:46:24,480
But artists, it may be.

1940
02:46:24,480 --> 02:46:27,280
Without my well-insuit, where would there be my dream?

1941
02:46:27,280 --> 02:46:29,760
Based on some media, that's a magic number.

1942
02:46:29,760 --> 02:46:31,120
What does it all mean?

1943
02:46:31,120 --> 02:46:32,880
Focus is formed by blocks of the soul.

1944
02:46:32,880 --> 02:46:34,960
Souls is lost, now game-paced by sounds.

1945
02:46:34,960 --> 02:46:36,880
Coming off speakers who aren't at the scope.

1946
02:46:36,880 --> 02:46:38,960
Skore it and daily create some of sound.

1947
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:40,880
Listen is listen, because this year is wisdom.

1948
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:42,960
Wisdom of a speaker, a dumb and a plug.

1949
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:45,280
Set aside a legal substance to feed them for now.

1950
02:46:45,280 --> 02:46:47,040
Get them high off this dialed jury.

1951
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:48,880
Time is effect, the switch time account.

1952
02:46:48,880 --> 02:46:50,880
Counting out the negative actions of one.

1953
02:46:50,880 --> 02:46:52,880
Sweepers of soul saves time and shout.

1954
02:46:52,880 --> 02:46:54,880
Three forms are sold to a positive sum.

1955
02:46:54,880 --> 02:46:56,880
Dance to this fits and flexes every muscle.

1956
02:46:56,880 --> 02:46:58,880
Space can be full if you ride like my lover.

1957
02:46:58,880 --> 02:47:00,800
Advanced to the tune, but don't keep a hustle,

1958
02:47:00,800 --> 02:47:02,800
shake rattle roll to my magic number.

1959
02:47:02,800 --> 02:47:06,080
Now you may try to subtract it, but it just won't grow away.

1960
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:08,240
Three times one.

1961
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:08,960
What is it?

1962
02:47:08,960 --> 02:47:10,400
Five, two, three.

1963
02:47:10,400 --> 02:47:11,600
Magic number.

1964
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:14,960
Jump with the jump.

1965
02:47:14,960 --> 02:47:15,040
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run

1966
02:47:44,960 --> 02:48:14,960
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run and, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,

1967
02:48:14,960 --> 02:48:24,960
I was walking down the street without the corner of my eyes

1968
02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:27,960
So I'm pretty little thing approaching me

1969
02:48:27,960 --> 02:48:30,960
She said I never seen a man who looked so well alone

1970
02:48:30,960 --> 02:48:33,960
The could you use a little company?

1971
02:48:33,960 --> 02:48:36,960
But if you break the right price, you need me

1972
02:48:36,960 --> 02:48:39,960
We'll be nice and you can go and send me all my way

1973
02:48:39,960 --> 02:48:41,960
I said you're such a sweet old thing

1974
02:48:41,960 --> 02:48:43,960
Why you do this to yourself?

1975
02:48:43,960 --> 02:48:46,960
She looked at me and this is what she said

1976
02:48:46,960 --> 02:48:49,960
Oh, they ain't no rest for the wicked

1977
02:48:49,960 --> 02:48:51,960
Mind it, don't go on chains

1978
02:48:51,960 --> 02:48:55,960
I got bills to pay, I got miles to be

1979
02:48:55,960 --> 02:48:57,960
And ain't nothing in this world for free

1980
02:48:57,960 --> 02:49:01,960
I know I can't slow down, I can't hold back though

1981
02:49:01,960 --> 02:49:04,960
You know, I wish I could

1982
02:49:04,960 --> 02:49:07,960
I know they ain't no rest for the wicked

1983
02:49:07,960 --> 02:49:10,960
And every close I rise for good

1984
02:49:10,960 --> 02:49:13,960
Not even 15 minutes later, I'm still walking on the street

1985
02:49:13,960 --> 02:49:16,960
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out of sight

1986
02:49:16,960 --> 02:49:18,960
And let me swim down the road behind him

1987
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:20,960
Put a gun up to my head, he made it clear

1988
02:49:20,960 --> 02:49:22,960
He wasn't looking for my flight

1989
02:49:22,960 --> 02:49:25,960
It's a key, I'm the only guy I want your money

1990
02:49:25,960 --> 02:49:28,960
Not your life, if you try to make a move, I won't detry

1991
02:49:28,960 --> 02:49:31,960
I told him you would have my cash, but first you know I've got to ask

1992
02:49:31,960 --> 02:49:34,960
What made you want to live this kind of life?

1993
02:49:34,960 --> 02:49:38,960
He said that ain't no rest for the wicked

1994
02:49:38,960 --> 02:49:41,960
Mind it, don't go on chains

1995
02:49:41,960 --> 02:49:44,960
I got bills to pay, I got miles to be

1996
02:49:44,960 --> 02:49:47,960
And ain't nothing in this world for free

1997
02:49:47,960 --> 02:49:50,960
I know I can't slow down, I can't hold back though

1998
02:49:50,960 --> 02:49:53,960
You know, I wish I could

1999
02:49:53,960 --> 02:49:56,960
I know they ain't no rest for the wicked

2000
02:49:56,960 --> 02:49:59,960
And tell me close I rise for good

2001
02:50:08,960 --> 02:50:14,960
When I was last and I was sitting in my house

2002
02:50:14,960 --> 02:50:17,960
The day was winding down and coming to an end

2003
02:50:17,960 --> 02:50:20,960
And so I turned into TV and flipped it over to the news

2004
02:50:20,960 --> 02:50:23,960
And why I saw I almost couldn't comprehend

2005
02:50:23,960 --> 02:50:27,960
I saw a picture man and cut see take a money from the church

2006
02:50:27,960 --> 02:50:30,960
He stepped as naked count with the righteous dollar bills

2007
02:50:30,960 --> 02:50:33,960
But even the stand I can't say much because I know what all the same

2008
02:50:33,960 --> 02:50:36,960
Or yes, we all see got to satisfy the rules

2009
02:50:36,960 --> 02:50:39,960
You know they ain't no rest for the wicked

2010
02:50:39,960 --> 02:50:42,960
Mind it, don't go on chains

2011
02:50:42,960 --> 02:50:45,960
We got bills to pay, we got miles to be

2012
02:50:45,960 --> 02:50:48,960
And ain't nothing in this world for free

2013
02:50:48,960 --> 02:50:52,960
I know we can't slow down, I can't hold back though

2014
02:50:52,960 --> 02:50:54,960
You know, we wish we could

2015
02:50:54,960 --> 02:50:58,960
I know they ain't no rest for the wicked

2016
02:50:58,960 --> 02:51:01,960
The elephant awesome track that is

2017
02:51:01,960 --> 02:51:03,960
Ain't no rest for the wicked on your daily source code

2018
02:51:03,960 --> 02:51:06,960
Eight five sevens, we're into the home stretch now

2019
02:51:06,960 --> 02:51:10,960
And wow, I can't wait, I'm gonna chill out

2020
02:51:10,960 --> 02:51:12,960
Oh, I see another no agenda shot coming in

2021
02:51:12,960 --> 02:51:16,960
Hookers and tacos, nice can't wait to put that into rotation

2022
02:51:16,960 --> 02:51:19,960
And of course those you listen to this on the podcast

2023
02:51:19,960 --> 02:51:24,960
You've got to get yourself a phone that has some kind of

2024
02:51:24,960 --> 02:51:27,960
Shoutcast compatible streaming receiver

2025
02:51:27,960 --> 02:51:29,960
Because that's what all the kids are doing these days

2026
02:51:29,960 --> 02:51:30,960
It's called a radio y'all

2027
02:51:30,960 --> 02:51:32,960
A cup of y'all, we're gonna go home

2028
02:51:32,960 --> 02:51:34,960
And then it's got a curry

2029
02:51:34,960 --> 02:51:36,960
Look me in the morning

2030
02:51:55,960 --> 02:52:02,960
The only time I feel alright is what you're saying

2031
02:52:02,960 --> 02:52:07,960
You go, I want to be with you all of the time

2032
02:52:07,960 --> 02:52:10,960
I'll take another name

2033
02:52:10,960 --> 02:52:13,960
I'll take another name

2034
02:52:13,960 --> 02:52:16,960
I'll take another name

2035
02:52:16,960 --> 02:52:20,960
I'll take another name

2036
02:52:20,960 --> 02:52:23,960
I'll do the tip that you ask me

2037
02:52:24,960 --> 02:52:26,960
Oh yeah, I'll do it

2038
02:52:26,960 --> 02:52:29,960
And I'll try and be honest with me never

2039
02:52:31,960 --> 02:52:38,960
The only time I feel alright is what you're saying

2040
02:52:38,960 --> 02:52:42,960
You go, I want to be with you all of the time

2041
02:52:42,960 --> 02:52:45,960
I'll take another name

2042
02:52:45,960 --> 02:52:48,960
I'll take another name

2043
02:52:54,960 --> 02:52:58,960
Oh yeah, I'll try and be honest with you all of the time

2044
02:52:59,960 --> 02:53:03,960
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

2045
02:53:03,960 --> 02:53:05,960
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

2046
02:53:05,960 --> 02:53:11,960
I'll try and be honest with you all of the time

2047
02:53:12,960 --> 02:53:15,960
I'll do it, I want to trust you

2048
02:53:15,960 --> 02:53:18,960
I've figured it out, but you'll end me today

2049
02:53:18,960 --> 02:53:20,960
Last forever

2050
02:53:20,960 --> 02:53:27,960
Oh yeah, all day, and I tell him you're as leave me never

2051
02:53:29,960 --> 02:53:36,960
The only time I feel right is by your side

2052
02:53:36,960 --> 02:53:41,960
Girl, I want to be with you all the time, all day

2053
02:53:41,960 --> 02:53:47,960
And all the night, all day, and all the night

2054
02:53:48,960 --> 02:53:53,960
The quintessential pirate radio song

2055
02:53:53,960 --> 02:53:57,960
Of course, if you've seen the movie, then you kind of know what I mean

2056
02:53:57,960 --> 02:54:02,960
The cakes, and all day, and all day, and all the night

2057
02:54:02,960 --> 02:54:05,960
All right, so we're kind of whining it down here

2058
02:54:05,960 --> 02:54:08,960
As it's the end of the week, and you know for some reason

2059
02:54:08,960 --> 02:54:10,960
It felt like weekend, I was really weird

2060
02:54:10,960 --> 02:54:14,960
Yesterday felt like Sunday, even though it was Thursday

2061
02:54:14,960 --> 02:54:17,960
Just I don't know, maybe time is accelerating

2062
02:54:17,960 --> 02:54:19,960
Or maybe it was because of the Christmas holiday

2063
02:54:19,960 --> 02:54:21,960
It was just in the middle of the week

2064
02:54:21,960 --> 02:54:25,960
Or maybe it just lost sense of all time, space and dimension

2065
02:54:25,960 --> 02:54:29,960
Because I'm very deep inside, playlists and macros

2066
02:54:29,960 --> 02:54:33,960
And tracks and scripts, and chat rooms, and by the way

2067
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:37,960
It looks like Mr. Royals got a new interface for the

2068
02:54:37,960 --> 02:54:40,960
Norgen Chat.net, which I'll be bringing out line pretty soon

2069
02:54:40,960 --> 02:54:43,960
People were doing some amazing shit

2070
02:54:43,960 --> 02:54:45,960
I for one could not be happy

2071
02:54:45,960 --> 02:54:50,960
And when I'm happy, I play songs that are gay

2072
02:54:52,960 --> 02:54:56,960
You've shattered the concerts before you said, hey, man, why'd you play some freebird?

2073
02:54:56,960 --> 02:54:58,960
Oh, here you go

2074
02:54:58,960 --> 02:55:03,960
On your daddy's source code eight five seven, the Charlie, the Fubar Friday edition

2075
02:55:03,960 --> 02:55:08,960
If I leave it tomorrow

2076
02:55:08,960 --> 02:55:15,960
Would you still remember me?

2077
02:55:19,960 --> 02:55:25,960
Well, I must be traveling on now

2078
02:55:27,960 --> 02:55:32,960
This is too many places I've got to see

2079
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:42,960
If I stay with you in the world

2080
02:55:43,960 --> 02:55:49,960
Things just couldn't be the same

2081
02:55:52,960 --> 02:55:58,960
Because I'm as free as bird now

2082
02:55:58,960 --> 02:56:05,960
And this bird you cannot change

2083
02:56:06,960 --> 02:56:13,960
Oh, and bird you cannot change

2084
02:56:16,960 --> 02:56:22,960
And this bird you cannot change

2085
02:56:22,960 --> 02:56:29,960
Oh, and bird you cannot change

2086
02:56:52,960 --> 02:56:59,960
Oh, and bird you cannot change

2087
02:57:03,960 --> 02:57:12,960
Oh, and bird you cannot change

2088
02:57:13,960 --> 02:57:18,960
Oh, and bird you cannot change

2089
02:57:18,960 --> 02:57:25,960
Please don't take so bad

2090
02:57:28,960 --> 02:57:33,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2091
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:42,960
If I stay with you

2092
02:57:42,960 --> 02:57:47,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2093
02:57:52,960 --> 02:57:57,960
Some as free as a burden

2094
02:58:00,960 --> 02:58:05,960
And this burden together change

2095
02:58:05,960 --> 02:58:12,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2096
02:58:15,960 --> 02:58:22,960
And this burden together change

2097
02:58:23,960 --> 02:58:29,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2098
02:58:30,960 --> 02:58:36,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2099
02:58:38,960 --> 02:58:43,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2100
02:58:44,960 --> 02:58:50,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2101
02:58:59,960 --> 02:59:06,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2102
02:59:29,960 --> 02:59:36,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2103
02:59:59,960 --> 03:00:06,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2104
03:00:29,960 --> 03:00:36,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2105
03:00:59,960 --> 03:01:06,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2106
03:01:29,960 --> 03:01:36,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2107
03:01:59,960 --> 03:02:06,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2108
03:02:29,960 --> 03:02:36,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2109
03:02:36,960 --> 03:02:38,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2110
03:02:38,960 --> 03:02:39,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2111
03:02:39,960 --> 03:02:42,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2112
03:02:42,960 --> 03:02:45,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2113
03:02:45,960 --> 03:02:47,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2114
03:02:47,960 --> 03:02:49,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2115
03:02:49,960 --> 03:02:51,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2116
03:02:51,960 --> 03:02:53,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2117
03:02:53,960 --> 03:02:54,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2118
03:02:54,960 --> 03:02:55,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2119
03:02:55,960 --> 03:02:57,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2120
03:02:57,960 --> 03:02:58,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2121
03:02:58,960 --> 03:03:03,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2122
03:03:15,960 --> 03:03:18,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2123
03:03:18,960 --> 03:03:23,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2124
03:03:23,960 --> 03:03:25,960
Oh, no sounds, but yeah

2125
03:03:25,960 --> 03:03:29,940
But let's, let's, let's not forget we need some live shows, you know, some talk shows

2126
03:03:29,940 --> 03:03:35,100
and just so much to do, so much to do, but what we're going to do it.

2127
03:03:35,100 --> 03:03:40,540
And of course Sunday, we will be here with the early morning service plenty of fun stuff

2128
03:03:40,540 --> 03:03:47,660
to talk about, particularly the president's brand new members of the economic advisory board.

2129
03:03:47,660 --> 03:03:48,660
Oh my God.

2130
03:03:48,660 --> 03:03:50,660
Could you have bigger shows being put in?

2131
03:03:50,660 --> 03:03:51,660
No.

2132
03:03:51,660 --> 03:03:52,660
Probably not.

2133
03:03:52,660 --> 03:03:58,480
So again, thanks to all of you for showing up during today's live show.

2134
03:03:58,480 --> 03:04:01,760
Can you hear that two beers is a little bit too much for me, perhaps?

2135
03:04:01,760 --> 03:04:05,120
Hey, that wraps up episode 8.57 of the Daily Source Code.

2136
03:04:05,120 --> 03:04:09,540
The Fubar Friday, birthing open source radio dish was produced with a help of hundreds

2137
03:04:09,540 --> 03:04:15,100
of chocolate, chocolate heads worldwide, and I lived to be 100 each of you 100 a day, so

2138
03:04:15,100 --> 03:04:19,420
never have to see my friends pass away until you talk to me next time, live your life

2139
03:04:19,420 --> 03:04:20,420
with passion.

2140
03:04:20,420 --> 03:04:23,020
And as long as it lasts, enjoy your fucking freedom.

2141
03:04:50,420 --> 03:05:00,580
And I'll pay now, where the world comes in, where they come, they come, you'll be

2142
03:05:00,580 --> 03:05:05,100
between us, we know they're both worth it.

2143
03:05:05,100 --> 03:05:16,100
And I want to know in my car, as I hold the room, my position's cause is a special

2144
03:05:16,100 --> 03:05:17,100
