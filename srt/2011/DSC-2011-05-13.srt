shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut the, shut to the, shut, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to, shut the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut the, shut to the, shut to the, shut to the, shut, shut to the, shut to, shut to the, shut up S. I shang, v-hak behind the, shut to the, shut to the, shut the,

141
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,900
We need that open source by Garner right now.

142
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,900
I'm giving a nice and great white North Comedia Rush.

143
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,900
Spirit of Radio.

144
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,900
Anorge on the string.com and daily source code 863.

145
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
But I'm a Yana.

146
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Like Forgible.

147
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
We need names that we live on.

148
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
We're so Ð±Ð»Ð°Ð³.

149
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,900
An unarmed Duty.

150
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,900
Lay it up, soylene and boom!

151
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,900
S firing, pe bet.

152
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,900
I want your way with your Rest.

153
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,900
Baby, no, baby, it's like it's not your thingers

154
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,900
One of us baby, you never leave us

155
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,900
I'm gonna lie, I'm gonna lie, I'm gonna lie

156
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,900
You don't have to be silent to me

157
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:10,900
Baby, no, baby, it's like it's not your thingers

158
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,900
Baby, no, baby, it's like it's not your thingers

159
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,900
Wrapped with light, my heart broken

160
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,900
Baby, don't pretend, no leaves don't let me handle you

161
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,900
Wrapped with light, no leaves don't let me handle you

162
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,900
But it barely lets me feel a price for my most free

163
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,900
Of the street I'm being lucky

164
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,900
Not a reason is to be all paid high

165
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,900
We're not gonna go to the charging tree

166
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,900
The question I'm the one is me

167
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,900
That you're the only thing

168
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,900
What an ice comes to me

169
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,900
A free life of news

170
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,900
But we're in crisis

171
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,900
And that's not the point of my dream

172
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,900
You can't even take my steel

173
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,900
You can't even take my steel

174
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,900
It means a full day away

175
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
It's cracking with fire

176
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Right if there's nothing so to be amigin

177
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
The question I'm the only thing that I'm the one

178
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,900
That's not the point of my dream

179
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,900
That you're the only thing that I'm the one

180
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,900
That you're the only one

181
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,900
That's not the point of my dream

182
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,900
That you're the only thing that I'm the one

183
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,900
That you're the only thing that I'm the one

184
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
That you're the one

185
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,900
That you're the one

186
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,900
That you're the one

187
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,900
That you're the one

188
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
That you're the one

189
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
That you're the one

190
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,900
That you're the one

191
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
That you're the one

192
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
That you're the one

193
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
That you're the one

194
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
That you're the one

195
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
That you're the one

196
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,900
That you're the one

197
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
That you're the only thing that I'm the one

198
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
That you're the one

199
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,900
That you're the one

200
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,900
That you're the one

201
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,900
That you're the one

202
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,900
That you're the one

203
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,900
That you're the one

204
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
You're the one

205
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
That's not the point of my dream

206
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,900
That you're the only one

207
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,900
That you're the one

208
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,900
It's me that you

209
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,900
I love you

210
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,900
I love you

211
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,900
I love you

212
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,900
I love you

213
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,900
I love you

214
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
I love you

215
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
I love you

216
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
I love you

217
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,900
I love you

218
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,900
Fuck all of you

219
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
We're here to rock

220
00:18:46,900 --> 00:19:16,900
I've seen you in the middle, but it's for me getting out of belly, not with you, but I've got more to it, but I'm so worried, I'm not out of your company, I don't need a baby, but it's gonna be my name, I got a little bit more chance for anybody else, I better understand, I've been out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself,

221
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:35,940
I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself, I'm out with myself

222
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,980
I know what you're buying, I've got no rent to

223
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,980
But follow me around, I got pretty far to do

224
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,940
I can't you in a head, you gone out in the sky

225
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,940
Get out of the white dust, I can't get away

226
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,940
You never regret it, I regret it, I can't get away

227
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,940
The car, I must demand, I'll picture like a mirror

228
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,940
I'm tired, I'm pretty wild

229
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,940
I don't feel bad, I don't feel bad

230
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,940
I don't feel anything, I don't feel bad

231
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,940
I don't feel bad, I can't get away

232
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,940
The car, I must demand, I'll picture like a mirror

233
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:17,940
I'm tired, I'm pretty wild

234
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,940
I don't feel bad, I don't feel bad

235
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,940
I don't feel bad, I don't feel bad

236
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,940
I don't feel bad, I don't feel bad

237
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,940
The car, I must demand, I can't get away

238
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,940
The car, I must demand, I'm pretty wild

239
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,940
The car, I must demand, I'll picture like a mirror

240
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,940
I'm tired, I must demand, I'll picture like a mirror

241
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,940
I'm tired, I must demand, I can't get away

242
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,940
The car, I must demand, I don't feel anything, I don'thmml

243
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,940
I'm tired, I'm pretty wild

244
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,500
There's rise wind again and I don't rise

245
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,820
Today, you're pretty hot you're hot

246
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,040
We'll come over to you

247
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,620
I love you

248
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,360
There you go

249
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,000
Nothing like a little bit ofÑÐµ

250
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,180
Sex, this Opening came about

251
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,400
When the albumè¿ pointed dance

252
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,760
When I was a kid

253
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,900
I remember mine the comics

254
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,600
Both we went

255
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Right here on your daily showdowns.

256
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Put down your speakers!

257
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,600
124 big coins received.

258
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,600
And that is more than enough to bring you a daily source

259
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,600
going to be talking about that about the future of money today.

260
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
I'm Chuck.

261
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,600
And all in all of your tunes to get you ready for the weekend.

262
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Only a week left until we all die.

263
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
That's right, the raps are coming on May 21st.

264
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
We make it through and get swooshed up to the heavens.

265
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Oh no, my friends!

266
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
I started this!

267
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
It's all for me, which I've been riding.

268
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
But it's not that way to see.

269
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
I've got the hell!

270
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
I swore though! I swore though!

271
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
I swore!

272
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
I swore!

273
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
I swore!

274
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
I swore!

275
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,600
I can't see the reds

276
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
I can't see the reds

277
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,600
It's all for me to see behind this minute and theä¹ itself.

278
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
It's all for you!

279
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,600
I swore though! I swore!

280
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
I swore!

281
00:22:48,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

282
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, so,

283
00:23:48,600 --> 00:24:18,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

284
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:41,140
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah,

285
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,140
That's pretty much the mantra these days for the human resources to win

286
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,140
To gut and awaken

287
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,140
Be aggressive, that's about all it can make

288
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,140
It's the margins of dust album

289
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,140
Got you, we're on the daily source code

290
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,140
The episode number is 8-6-3

291
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,140
And this is going on blind

292
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,140
The remote y'all in 1st, give them a nation

293
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,140
I know it's in the stream.com

294
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,140
Come on in baby

295
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:25,140
We're so intense, we have other revenge

296
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:31,140
And now we must be in about seven days

297
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,140
And another reason strong

298
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,140
Playin' my favorite song

299
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:43,140
And I could tell it would be long, it was with me, yeah, me

300
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,140
And I could tell it would be long, it would be with me

301
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,140
Yeah, me singing, I love you

302
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,140
Sweet love time, it's too much like that

303
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,140
I love you, I love you, I love you

304
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,140
Sweet things, I love it, let's make the way

305
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,140
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

306
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:07,140
It's my so hot, got up and ask for his name

307
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,140
And I could let your marriage say, because it's all the same

308
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,140
And I could tell it would be with me, yeah, me

309
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,140
And I could tell it would be with me

310
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:24,140
And I could tell it would be with me, yeah, me

311
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,140
And I could tell it would be with me, yeah, me

312
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,140
And I could tell it would be with me, yeah, me

313
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:37,140
And I could tell it would be, yeah, me

314
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:42,140
And I could tell it would be with me

315
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:49,140
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

316
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,140
It's my so hot, got up and ask for his name

317
00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:10,140
And we'll be moving on and singing at some old song

318
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:19,140
And we'll be singing in a rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock.

319
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,140
And we'll be moving on and singing at some old song, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock,

322
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:35,140
So you think my singing's all in time, it makes me money

323
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:42,140
I don't know why, I don't know why

324
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:49,140
And it's more than I know, so come on, feel the noise

00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:05,140
Come on, feel the noise, tell us how to voice

328
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:13,140
With this far, far, far, far, far, far

329
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:19,140
So you think I got a funny face, I got no worries

330
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:26,140
And I don't know why, I don't know why

331
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:32,140
Love that I see there's something strange, I'm in no hurry

332
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:38,140
And I don't know why, I don't know why

333
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:45,140
And it's more than I know, come on, feel the noise

334
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:52,140
Tell us how to voice, with this far, far, far

335
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,140

Far, far, far, far, far, far, far

340
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:54,140
Why you think we have a reason to hide, you should know better

341
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:00,140
I don't know why, I don't know why

342
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:06,140
So you think I'm turning fine, I'm a pain go together

343
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:13,140
I don't know why, I don't know why

344
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:20,140

348
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:58,140
We're gonna get wild, we're gonna be wild, we're gonna be wild

349
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:23,300
Oh yeah, as I tweeted earlier, I got a fever and the only thing that can turn is

350
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:29,220
work out now. Everybody looking at that resource code if you're just tuning in, this

351
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:35,300
is your once a month extra begins, it seems, more or less these days.

352
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:42,420
There we go. Nice to see everybody on board, nice to have you all here for the Fubar

353
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:48,380
Friday. Actually, I really didn't have all that much time to do the show today, but I made

354
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,260
a very solemn promise for those of you who've been following along with the conversation

355
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:58,700
that on the Noah gender podcast, there's this new form of money, which is Bitcoins.

356
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:03,060
By the way, I've got the window open here. So when the mic goes live, you kind of hear a

357
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,940
water and neighbors and all kinds of stuff rolling along, it's going to be another scorcher

358
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,700
here. And so then California, the people's Republic, up at the Hilltop Watch Sour

359
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:18,180
Crackpot Command Center. So he's a little bit of air. So this whole idea, and I'm not going to get

360
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,180
too much into it about what Bitcoins really are, but I said, look, if this stuff is

361
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,500
real, then it should work in the following way. I should be able to provide some value to

362
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,380
the human resources. They provide me with some Bitcoins. And in return for that, I should be

363
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,340
able to go and spend those Bitcoins on stuff that I need. Now, the two things I need the most are

364
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:42,100
food and rent. Now, throwing gas as well. Now, I don't think rent is a possibility. I don't

365
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:47,940
think my landlord, land lady will accept the Bitcoins as payment just yet. When it comes to

366
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:53,060
gas, not so sure yet. Now, of course, I could turn these back into dollars. And by the way,

367
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,780
the exchange rate has gone up significantly since I started the experiment. So last night,

368
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,820
it was about six and a half bucks. But that would kind of be cheating because the whole idea

369
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,500
is to keep it in the virtual currency. I want to be able to buy things that I absolutely

370
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:13,460
need with these Bitcoins. So I was able to order some coffee and I was able to order some

371
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:19,060
bath soap. I'm looking for more real-world products to come on board. Now, again, it is very simple.

372
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:23,140
People are emailing me all the time. Yeah, you can change it for dwellers and all those different

373
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:27,700
stuff. Yeah, I know that. But if it really is going to take off, if this is really going to work,

374
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,220
now, I'm just going to presume that Steve Gibson and all these other guys who checked all the

375
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:37,380
algorithms and the security of it and that it absolutely is kind of like a true virtual gold,

376
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:43,780
then we should be able to purchase stuff online with these Bitcoins. So since she is in the chat room

377
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:49,780
at the moment, I'm wondering, Bobby, would you be willing to accept some Bitcoins on your webcam show?

378
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:58,980
As I'll tell you, I've spent them on you, baby. I'm just saying that we really want

379
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:08,980
this virtual economy to take off. We need porn as well. And some Bitcoins.

380
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:58,980
I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I

381
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:28,980
I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I

382
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:58,980
I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm just saying that I'm

383
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,780
Be positive light that'll ring your fingers

384
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,500
Got a scene for this break and they show your role

385
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,520
Come, come Festals King!

386
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,860
The whole song is dead my tears

387
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,860
Dout my teeth on! Our heart won't hear

388
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,740
Hey, our arms!

389
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,400
Absolutely!

390
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:52,980
Take a look to the sky, let's be born, you die, pizza laughs, let me wave it away

391
00:37:52,980 --> 00:38:22,980
Oh, hell, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

392
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:52,980
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

393
00:38:52,980 --> 00:39:07,620
And the open source daily source code Dropbox is armed by ahhh, for whom the bell tolls

394
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:15,220
Metallica would be San Francisco Philharmonic Orchestra, the classics, fits so well together

395
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,220
Don't you agree?

396
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:24,180
And we have a confirmation Bobby said she will accept my big coins what else will she accept is the question?

397
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:31,460
Little bit of no agenda records on calm on the stream right now and on the Charlie Jasper Avenue

398
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,820
Is into the shot

399
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:48,020
When you tell it a pause and straight in the close give us a smile never to find a way

400
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,460
I wish I would say how much love you

401
00:39:52,340 --> 00:40:02,340
Here I think you're myself I've never done a show at least for a while never to find a way

402
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:12,340
I wish I would say how much love you baby you'd find me to say what you want me when you don't do

403
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:19,940
There's a letter that the answer can't mark that I didn't mark

404
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:28,980
But I've never done a show at least for a while never to find a way

405
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:41,780
Oh I've been lying to you and I stood with you and looked in the left never to find a way

406
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,180
I wish I would say how much love you

407
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:55,620
I'd do it rather than need and press on to need and try to be friends never to find a way

408
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:05,860
I wish I would say how much love you baby you'd find me to say what you want me when you don't do

409
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:11,460
There's a letter that the answer can't mark that I didn't mark

410
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:16,500
But I've never done a show at least for a while never to find a way

411
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,700
I wish I would say how much love you

412
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:27,380
I'd do it rather than need and press on to need and press on to be friends never to find a way

413
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:32,980
I wish I would say how much love you

414
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:40,660
I'd do it rather than need and try to be friends never to find a way

415
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:46,420
But I've never done a show at least for a while never to find a way

416
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:52,820
I wish I would say how much love you

417
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:00,500
Baby you'd find me to say what you want me when you don't do

418
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:08,500
So, they wanted nobody's up with God, don't get a fire

419
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:15,500
Say whoever's God is someone who bought an installation

420
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,500
Once you kept your mistakes and those were the breaks

421
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,500
So, people took care, never to find a way

422
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,500
So, let's say how much love you

423
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:39,500
But now there's never a prize to roll in the dice

424
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:51,500
And isn't it nice, isn't it nice, isn't it nice, isn't it nice, isn't it nice, isn't it nice, isn't it nice

425
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:07,500
You know, this dream is still ever seen

426
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:18,500
Wenged the fly, me, I could've fed a few more than four minutes to the show

427
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:27,500
So, tell me how we're going to go home, and it's gotta carry

428
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,500
Looking in the morning

429
00:43:48,500 --> 00:44:05,500
Once we're on a break and one on a gas tank

430
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:12,500
Well, it's too much traffic, I can't control

431
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,500
So, let's say how much love you

432
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:22,500
But now there's never a prize to roll in the dice

433
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:27,500
So, let's say how much love you

434
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,500
But now there's never a prize to roll in the dice

435
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,620
Pick my losses, all i'm done

436
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,960
Again a faÃ§o

437
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,780
I laugh

438
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,240
I'm done

439
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:21,240
I know it's wrong, you're asking me to chillin'

440
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:27,240
Look me in the eyes, you'll give my corners again

441
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,240
But yeah, it might be of the wrong way

442
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:35,240
But it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine

443
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,240
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine

444
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,240
It's fine, it's fine

445
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,240
It's fine, it's fine

446
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:50,240
It's fine, it's fine

447
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,240
I can't do it, it's fine

448
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,240
I can't do it, it's fine

449
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:06,240
I can't do it, it's fine

450
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:14,240
I did not finish my life

451
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,240
It's too big

452
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,240
It's too big

453
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:25,240
It's too big

454
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:30,240
When I saw that smoking door was hard to hear

455
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,240
I did not finish my life

456
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,240
It's too big

457
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,240
When I saw that smoking door at the desk

458
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:13,600
You know, we got this big knowledge and innovation tour coming up and it's making

459
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:18,240
an eye because no lacrosse, good motivation going down to the south, down the road, the floor

460
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,360
to panhand all the way up, north coming all the way back across the United States of

461
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,360
get no nation.

462
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,680
I don't know if we'll be able to drive 55 or if we'll be able to drive much faster than

463
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:35,520
that quite frankly considering how incredibly big the RV must be to contain, well,

464
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,520
primarily my hair.

465
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:04,680
When I'm almost there, I need your arms and your arms to pay off you.

466
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,680
Now you're best in the world, I'm gonna lose you.

467
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,680
I'm gonna lose you.

468
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,680
Now you're best in the world, I'm gonna lose you.

469
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,680
Now you're best in the world, I'm gonna lose you.

470
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,680
I'm gonna lose you.

471
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,680
I'm gonna lose you.

472
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,680
I ain't too glad I can't see

473
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,680
Red eyes mama, baby

474
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,680
You're the time I'm gonna be your cruiser

475
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,680
Now you're busy with us

476
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,680
You're starting to say

God, I've seen this live and kick some major fuckin' ass.

557
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,040
South Jordan, make you believe we're on the Charlie.

558
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:05,040
I'll never tell y'all a little story about this time, I will stay alive.

559
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,040
Just go through this all the way home.

560
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,040
But if you look, you'll find this Saturday.

561
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,040
It's all about time, listen up.

562
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:24,040
I've been sitting here all night trying to make us find work out right.

563
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,040
I've been getting nowhere past.

564
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,040
Suddenly, I'll let down the bed.

565
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,040
And you and little boys inside of my head.

566
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,040
You said, would you wanna do this girl?

567
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,040
Yeah, I got the hands off of it.

568
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,040
You're not here in the sun.

569
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,040
Or in the fire, you'll be there.

570
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,040
It's all through my story.

571
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,040
Listen to me, oh yeah.

572
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,040
You, I will make you a believer.

573
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:03,040
You'll feel a surprise for yourself, I can tell man.

574
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,040
You, I will make you a believer.

575

Yeah, I will make you a believer.

I, you, the Charlie, make you a man.

577
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,040
So, the Black Sun does cover him.

578
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,040
That you keep it to the heart.

579
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,040
That you keep it to the heart.

580
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,040
That you let the man your world.

581
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,040
That you know perroo.

582
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,040

608

00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:36,040

That's untouchable

721
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,040
I can't lay it next to track it shit

722
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,040
Here's you, I'm like a slut to your chest

723
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,040
Like a vent for you, Jimmy

724
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,040
In the city of sex

725
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,040
We ain't that sunshine

726
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,040
Stayed what a bomb has to be

727
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,040
The state where you never find a dance low empty

728
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,040
And feel free

729
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,040
The mission for them brings

730
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,040
Leave me money making machines over the range

731
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,040
I've been in the game for 10 years

732
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,040
Making right tunes

733
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,040
Every since honey was wearing that suit

734
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,040
Now I was not the father

735
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,040

736
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,040
I'm in shinin

737
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,040
Looking like a robable body

738
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,040
It's all through

739
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,040
From Diego to the play

740
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,040
You'll see me at the farm

741
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,040
If they're city making play

742
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,040
So the figure they feel the same way

743
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,040
Straight to the table

744
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,040
We can't afford our game

745
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,040
Time you killed

746
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,040
The little sad party

747
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,040
Time to party

748
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,040
For you

749
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,040
West and whole

750
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,040
You sad party

751
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,040
Yes, yes, yes

Let's see the city

754
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,040

I tried to run, but I got a gun, and I should stand and eat your head

888
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,400
And then you end a man from on, she's got a knife

889
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,680
And he can call to eat cattle ass

01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,600
And then when there's no more cars you go out of night

893
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,920
And eat up bars, where the people need

894
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,320

One, two, one, man to man, they don't talk, don't need

896
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:50,520
Snowpots meant the masses, who would call to eat

897
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,360
But yeah, one more, go to dark, follow the horse

898

Stay safe, stay safe, stay safe, stay safe, stay safe

900
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,680
And then you end a man from on, she's got a knife

901
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,960
asking for the police for this

902
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,620
But they'll get loaded

903
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:25,760
Then I can't ÐÐµ

904
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,280
got the bullet

905
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:32,900
And there's no more cars you go out of night

906
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:37,620
And then you end a man from on, she's got a gun

907
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:42,780
And I should stand and eat your head

908
01:12:42,780 --> 01:13:12,780
One, two, three, four, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five

912
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:31,540

And now you only need to start with ya!

915
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:45,640
All right, what a revelation that was back in the day.

916
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,640
That's fine, Freddie.

917
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:59,160
The bendy hair is out to the hood, and started the white chick rap, the red hilly

918
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,160
shit.

919
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:03,640
And pretty much the crossover of hip-hop, that's for sure.

920
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:08,480
Wow, it's been amazing watching Noah Jen, the news network.com, seeing all the news

921
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:12,080
flow and through, that's coming out from the ministry of truth.

922
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:18,320
I love how all these sources who need to remain anonymous are telling us all this stuff

923
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:26,520
about the incredible beauty that was taken away from Osama Bin Laden's, well, what is

924
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:27,520
it?

925
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:36,760
There was his mansion, his compound, his layer, his hideaway, his doctor evil.

926
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:40,320
And now the latest, of course, is that they found porn, right?

927
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:45,660
Hey, listen, if it says unnamed sources and it's reported by Associated Press, I'm just

01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:50,200
trying to fuck you in the ass, my friends, making you crazy.

01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:56,000

So I bet no other thing to think, but I speak for it on me right now

Alone in the Palace

I wanna fuck you in the ass

946
01:16:40,140 --> 01:17:10,140
I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the air, I want to fuck you in the

948
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:50,300
Okay, I mean, I'm only playing the scene guys know what they really think of you.

949
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:57,660
That's all they think about, all they long about, what we can do to the human resources.

950
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:59,460
That's their theme song right there.

951
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:03,460
Kevin, I know what's going on.

952
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:08,220
Ah, speaking of such, maybe we should roll out our theme song here for a moment.

953
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:12,540
Please and gentlemen, please rise for your get-monition.

954
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:14,140
The national anthem.

955
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:16,140
Thank you, Mr. Long, if you're so wish.

956
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:20,460
In the morning, get it, wonation.

957
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:24,860
We are all charged up to me.

958
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:37,980
Human resources and servants in all lands and all ships that seem east west from the east to west down on the two.

959
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:42,380
The lowlands and beyond.

960
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:52,540
We are happy and distracted slaves to our human nation's own.

961
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:01,900
And come out for you, on your radio.

962
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:05,980
Round me, Mr. Vice, you're listening to right now, it's no longer radio.

963
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:10,700
You spell that R-E-Y-H-D-I-O, just saying, I'm glad you're here.

964
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,980
I have to talk, I just want a hand.

965
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:17,580
And I'm a weekend in a rock and a band.

966
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:21,660
One Friday night in my hometown, buy and watch.

967
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:24,700
A girl who looked like a beast.

968
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:28,300
She said at me and it was turning beyond.

969
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:31,980
She said she worked in a beauty salon.

970
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:35,500
I heard her voice inside the same.

971
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:38,140
She ain't predestined, she just looks that word.

972
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:49,900
We made a date to come for a drink.

973
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:53,500
I wore jeans and she wore a mink.

974
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:57,580
There was this music such an hour of a channel that she ate.

975
01:19:57,580 --> 01:20:00,620
And the only guy I bought the pound, she said.

976
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:04,220
Take me home now, one little bus.

977
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:07,820
I said to sure you guys can change for the party.

978
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:11,420
Watching a lever, the bartender said.

979
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:14,140
She ain't predestined, she just looks that word.

980
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:34,220
I think it needs a little bit of bus.

981
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:38,060
So I call her up, her father was home.

982
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:40,860
Send me a billiard, she can't come home.

983
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:41,900
How about it?

984
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:47,900
I have a breath that decided to wait, like I need us.

985
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,900
Give me the date.

986
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:53,020
I fell in love with a model from hell.

987
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:56,460
It took some time for my moments to tell.

988
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:00,060
That takes a year has been a great mistake.

989
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:03,260
She ain't predestined, she just looks that word.

990
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:06,540
We made a date to come for a drink.

991
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:09,020
She ain't predestined, she just looks that word.

992
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:13,340
She ain't predestined, she just looks that word.

993
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:17,580
She ain't predestined, she just looks that word.

994
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:35,420
She ain't predestined, she just looks that word.

995
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:48,460
You do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do

997
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:50,660
We're going on a team that suits us, we are going for the regus

998
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:54,660
You're curious when you're my girl

999
01:22:54,660 --> 01:23:01,660
Get it on, make a ball, get it on

1000
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:08,660
Get it on, make a ball, get it on

1001
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:21,660
The loser rushes, the Esterkey house

1002
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:24,660
Yeah, what?

1003
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:30,900
Take the ball, get it on

1004
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,660
Get it on

1005
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:36,660
Get the ball

All of times we've come

We've got time to go

1028
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:24,540
Seasons don't fear the reason

1029
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:27,540
Don't do the weirdness all the way

1030
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:29,540
We could make that feel

1031
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:32,540
Come on baby, don't feel

Maybe that's what we needed.

1153
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:51,320

By the way, I tweeted this earlier and I actually don't tweet anymore.

01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:20,120
Uh-huh.

01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:26,480
You're addicted to love, my ears will be hurt

1195
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:30,480
You're addicted to love, my ears will be hurt

01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,480
You're addicted to love

I, you are addicted to love

1200
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:41,480
Maybe I'm just addicted to love

1201
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:43,480
Maybe we're all addicted to love in one way

1202
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:45,480
The other one, the form, shape, the other

1203
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:51,480
But daddy, all the radio, had him carry with the daily source code

1204
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:54,480
Playin' all your songs from the open source daily source code

1205
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:58,480
Dropbox, we are crankin' out baby on a football Friday where they say they say

We're the classin' for the hand day

Now, we're tryin' to walk a straight line

1213
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:29,480
Outside, we're massive chiefs, we're in

1214
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:33,480
Now, we're tryin' for a trick, boys

01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:37,480
Now, we're gonna make a big noise

1216
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:41,480
So, don't worry about tomorrow, take it to the side

1217
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:45,480
We're gonna go the same, we're gonna kill the player

1218
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:48,480
Now, we're gonna make a big noise

Now, we're gonna make a big noise

1225

Now, we're gonna make a big noise

1229
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:38,480
Take it to the side, forget about the truth

1230
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:44,480
We'll get rid of the pain, from the break of pain

1231
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:50,480
That'll explain how it is, you'll be

1232
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:56,480
From a break of pain, just now

1233
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:08,940
You can't escape again, you can't escape

1234
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:10,380
You can't escape

1235
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:12,540
You can't escape

1236
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:13,980
You can't escape

1237
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:15,020
You can't escape

1238
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:16,460

You can't escape

1242
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:25,200
One with an you think

1243
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,200
Using your fate

1244
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:28,400
Now's a great destiny

1245
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:29,720
One with an you think

1246
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:30,660
You can't escape

1247
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:31,680
And you can't escape

1248
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:32,680
And you can't escape

1249
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:33,680
You can't escape

1250
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:34,180
We can't escape

1251
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:36,180
Come

1252
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:45,180
Don't let go of the day

1253
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:47,180
Don't let go of the wound

1254
01:46:47,180 --> 01:46:49,180
Drink the bottle sweet

1255
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:51,180
Where would die my dreams

1256
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:53,180
I'm dying to take you far

1257
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:55,180
Can't they keep me high

1258
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:57,180
Try my best

1259
01:46:57,180 --> 01:46:59,180
Don't let go of the day

1260
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:02,180
I'm dying to take you

1261
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:05,180
I'm dying to take you far

1262
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:08,180
I'm dying to take you far

1263
01:47:08,180 --> 01:47:12,180
I'm dying to take you far

1264
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:15,180
I think I need you as a restless must-feet

1265
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:18,180
If you go on here, I think I need you

1266
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:20,180
She deesh you on the Charlie's

1267
01:47:20,180 --> 01:47:21,180
Why?

1268
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:24,180
Just got a text from the lovely Miss Mickey

1269
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:26,180
Apparently she's down there, the nails are long

1270
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:28,180
Everybody is checking out the shows

1271
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:31,180
So I guess I have to play a song for her then, huh?

1272
01:47:31,180 --> 01:47:35,180
Question is, do you want me or do I want you?

1273
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:37,180
Or do I want you to want me?

1274
01:47:37,180 --> 01:47:40,180

I want you

1288
01:48:58,180 --> 01:49:02,180
I need you

1289
01:49:02,180 --> 01:49:06,180
I love you

1290
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:12,180
I beg you to make me

Well 2007

1338
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:27,200
now officially switched from my iPhone 4 to the Android operating system. And now I am using my

1339
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:35,200
Google Nexus S as my primary device. I got to tell you, I'm kind of loving it. Somehow it feels

1340
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:39,760
just a little more free, a little more open. Maybe that's the kind of stuff that I need to do.

1341
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:49,040
Deep. Okay, for the ladies down the nest along, hello ladies. Thanks a way, brush left and right now.

1342
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:54,480
Chill, got you still, I'm back. Can you be filled with satisfaction when we're done?

1343
01:54:54,480 --> 01:55:03,520
That's the fashion I was to come. I couldn't dance for another. I couldn't dance for another.

1344
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:10,880

1346
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:43,520
No, I couldn't dance for another.

1347
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:51,520
No, I couldn't dance for another.

1348
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:53,520
Come back.

1349
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,520
All the good.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1351
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1352
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:11,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1353
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:15,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1354
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:17,520
One bottle.

1355
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:21,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1356
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:27,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1357
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:33,520
I think this was so real.

1358
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:37,520
What got to do you learn, I don't know, I feel chill, it's the life broke light,

1359
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:41,520
making it new and especially other shows.

1360
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:45,520
Music makes me so moved.

1361
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:49,520
We'll over rhythm, we'll have to come on low and low with electric cars

1362
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:51,520
It gets to the dark, baby, you'll be alive

1363
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:53,520
You'll be your seat, look on the side of you

1364
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:55,520
Baby, you'll see them rhythm is a gear

1365
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,740
When you're going to hit, 80K or you quit to stop

1366
01:56:57,740 --> 01:57:00,280
One of us people when I hear something who play a part-pack

1367
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:03,480
Follow them shoot, baby, you sing about to hear

1368
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:09,320
difficult to sing

1369
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:11,520
for sure

1370
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:16,600
Jump is in the hands of a

1371
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:27,520
i liked it

1372
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:40,080
I learnt a lot more

1373
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:47,220
It's amazing

1374
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:57,520
Oh!

1375
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:59,520
Oh!

1376
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,520
Oh!

1377
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:03,520
Oh!

1378
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:05,520
Oh, you guys have been doing such a great drive.

1379
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:08,520
All of a sudden the Dropboxes just filled up with all kinds of great tunes.

1380
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:11,520
I think I can keep going just a little bit longer.

1381
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:13,520
Yeah!

1382
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,520
Okay, he's the girl.

1383
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:17,520
Sir, I'm glad you're home.

1384
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:18,520
Come on in.

1385
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:20,520
Tell me what to do to you.

1386
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:23,520
I know you really found us to think the world won't.

1387
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:27,520
But I think it's time to learn how to use your tongue.

1388
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:29,520
Hmm, I sure.

1389
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:32,520
You say you want this to be even, then you want this to be fair.

1390
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:36,520
But you're afraid to get your teeth cut into my teeth again.

1391
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:41,520
Maybe I'll end up sucking on the dick.

1392
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:46,520
You've got the hat to give me more than just a token with.

1393
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:50,520
But you may not look much better than how.

1394
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:54,520
Go to your turn.

1395
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:55,520
Now!

1396
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:57,520
Yes, you suck!

1397
01:58:57,520 --> 01:58:58,520
Taken hard!

1398
01:58:58,520 --> 01:58:59,520
Go down!

1399
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,520
Hey, you suck!

1400
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:03,520
Bring it on!

1401
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:05,520
And move your tongue around!

1402
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:06,520
You suck!

1403
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:10,520
If you worry about babies, you can lower your ribs.

1404
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:15,520
But give me that's what the gun all I get is kiss.

1405
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:19,520
It's on your face that I've got to step.

1406
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:24,520
You can wiggle, you can wiggle your tongue to my foot.

1407
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:29,520
Don't worry about making me have an arse as I'm.

1408
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:33,520
Just take your time and do what you do to yourself.

1409
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:35,520
And move the arse as I'm.

1410
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:38,520
I can tell it's making me scared just in another.

1411
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:43,520
But you better learn to love it.

1412
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:45,520
I want you suck!

1413
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:47,520
Go down!

1414
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:49,520
You suck!

1415
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:52,520
And move your tongue around!

1416
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:53,520
Now you suck!

1417
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:55,520
Taken hard!

1418
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:56,520
Go down!

1419
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:58,520
Hey, you suck!

1420
01:59:58,520 --> 01:59:59,520
Bring it on!

1421
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:02,520
And move your tongue around!

1422
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:07,520
When you hear say sexy under your breath,

1423
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:11,520
we've got to take cover work floating with fat.

1424
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:16,520
This is our room we've got to talk.

1425
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:20,520
Break it out your little damn and your latex song.

1426
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,520
I'm your latex song.

1427
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:28,520
I've got my muck away from the ground.

1428
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:30,520
Heatin' up my toilet.

1429
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:34,520
Dinner is songy and busy with my good thing.

1430
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:39,520
Got a couple of flames with a little shock for me.

1431
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:44,520
I know you said much as pussy with a cover.

1432
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:46,520
I'm digging too.

1433
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:48,520
You can't taste the trigger.

1434
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:51,520
There's no slide at all.

1435
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:53,520
You're gonna unprotected stroke.

1436
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:58,520
This ain't no joke.

1437
02:00:58,520 --> 02:00:59,520
Sisters!

1438
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:02,520
Sister!

1439
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:04,520
She got the power!

1440
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:05,520
Using!

1441
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:09,520
You've got a condom, right?

1442
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:10,520
Huh?

1443
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:11,520
I'm unprotected.

1444
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:13,520
Hey, you want a pill?

1445
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:14,520
No, that was great.

1446
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:16,520
And everything but you know I think that you're trying to go down me.

1447
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:17,520
On time.

1448
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:18,520
I'm tired.

1449
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:19,520
I'm tired.

1450
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:20,520
Come on.

1451
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:21,520
Come on, baby.

1452
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:22,520
Show me!

1453
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:23,520
Oh, that's amazing.

1454
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:24,520
Hey, I hear you mean tired.

1455
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:27,520
I know you think it's real drag.

1456
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:31,520
Just let my cup when I'm on the rag.

1457
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:32,520
Ooh!

1458
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:35,520
Quick making up, spark that came out.

1459
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:36,520
Break it!

1460
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:40,520
Cause I really don't believe that you've got a headache.

1461
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:44,520
You tell me it's worth a set by yeast infection.

1462
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:49,520
How do you think I feel when I get a new direction?

1463
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:52,520
Oh, you don't waste your tongue.

1464
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:54,520
Make excuses and lies.

1465
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:58,520
Did the face be between my thighs?

1466
02:01:58,520 --> 02:01:59,520
Right now.

1467
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:00,520
Now you suck.

1468
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:01,520
Why don't you suck?

1469
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:02,520
Why don't you suck?

1470
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:04,520
Come down, baby.

1471
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:05,520
You suck.

1472
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:06,520
Make it up.

1473
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:08,520
Make it up.

1474
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:23,520
Somehow I have the feeling that the girls down the nail salon really enjoyed that song.

1475
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:25,520
Used to girls and used to suck you on the daily source code.

1476
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:27,520
It's episode 863.

1477
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:28,520
We've created so far.

1478
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:31,520
This is the weekend bit coin blast off.

1479
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:32,520
Extravaganza.

1480
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:35,520
Due to the fact that I've received more than 100 bit coins in my account.

1481
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:42,520
And I now can spend them on Bobby Eden's web chat thing along with a spending on some coffee

1482
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:47,520
and a shampoo and other really important articles that I can get in real life.

1483
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:49,520
We should probably keep this going.

1484
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:52,520
So if I can receive another 100, we'll do another one next Friday.

1485
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:54,520
And we'll just keep that rolling.

1486
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:57,520
Now in the chat room, our friend Ray from Ray on the Charlie.

1487
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:00,520
You can hear her show on Mondays and Wednesdays at 12 o'clock.

1488
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:01,520
Get Monation Westtime.

1489
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:05,520
This is something that I have not played that he's queued up for me.

1490
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:07,520
I think the last source code.

1491
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:09,520
So just like the Easter girl said,

1492
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:11,520
I suck and I missed it, but here it is, right?

1493
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:14,520
In the morning, everybody.

1494
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:15,520
Game over.

1495
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:16,520
Hardcore.

1496
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:22,520
So it's a new daily source code, huh?

1497
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:27,520
Soundtrack to my life.

1498
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:30,520
Well, for everybody who's a big fan of Ray on the Charlie,

1499
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:34,520
every Monday at 12 p.m. Pacific time on open source radio,

1500
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:36,520
well, the numbers got a little bit mixed up.

1501
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:40,520
I already recorded 59 and this is number 60 of Ray on the Charlie,

1502
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:44,520
but this is broadcast at earlier than number 59.

1503
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:46,520
Well, don't look at the numbers.

1504
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:49,520
Let's take a look at the soundtrack.

1505
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:53,520
This soundtrack is about two separate periods in Adam's life.

1506
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:56,520
1985 and 2004.

1507
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:00,520
In 1985, Adam was hosting the most popular radio show

1508
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:03,520
of Get Monation Lowlands on Veronica.

1509
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:05,520
Now because he was a big shot,

1510
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:08,520
he convinced his DJ colleagues to make a certain song,

1511
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:10,520
a lot of them scared.

1512
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:12,520
The most important record of the week.

1513
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:16,520
The next week, the song entered the top 40 charts at number 40.

1514
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:19,520
To leave the charts, the week after that.

1515
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:22,520
But that doesn't say the song is crap.

1516
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:27,520
In 2004, Adam was hosting a morning show in Get Monation Lowlands,

1517
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,520
called Curry and the Crew.

1518
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:39,520
Our plot fodder was living in Get Monation Channel

1519
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:41,520
for man at his period in time,

1520
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:45,520
and drove in the middle of the night to get the show at 6 a.m. on the road.

1521
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:48,520
How do you like your eggs in the morning?

1522
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:51,520
I like my mother kids.

1523
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:53,520
And the world is bright.

1524
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:55,520
I'm satisfied.

1525
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:58,520
And long as I get my kids.

1526
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:04,520
Just as long as I get my kids.

1527
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:08,520
Commander, Adam isn't amazing stuff during that year.

1528
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:12,520
He and his crew went through Iraq after the Ministry of Defense

1529
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:14,520
from Get Monation Lowlands had given permissions

1530
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:17,520
to make a live radio show from Camp Smitty.

1531
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:20,520
During the war in Iraq,

1532
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:28,520
100 Dutch troops were stationed in as some of our one week carrying crew broadcasts in life from a war zone

1533
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:32,520
How do you like eggs in the morning?

1534
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:34,520
I like mine with a kid

1535
02:05:34,520 --> 02:05:37,520
I put down

1536
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:39,520
I'll never frown

1537
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:41,520
It's can be almost bliss

1538
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:47,520
Just as long as I get my kid

1539
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:50,520
Adam Kyrgy, Alexander Stevens

1540
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:51,520
We can kill Faestah

1541
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:53,520
And of course, the news angered me

1542
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:55,520
I don't want to bear

1543
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:56,520
Kyrgy and the crew

1544
02:05:56,520 --> 02:06:00,520
Present Operation Iraqi sunrise

1545
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:05,520
Can't sleep ready for transition

1546
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:12,520
65 of our 8.000 feet

1547
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:14,520
Day 1

1548
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:18,520
Alexander Stevens, El Stevens

1549
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:19,520
We kill Faestah

1550
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:20,520
By Binska

1551
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:22,520
Adam Langeber, the news guy

1552
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:24,520
And crew commander Adam Kyrgy

1553
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:25,520
Day 2

1554
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:26,520
Day 2

1555
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:27,520
Live from Camp Smith

1556
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:29,520
Live from Hadiyak

1557
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:31,520
I can't

1558
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:33,520
I can't

1559
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:34,520
I can't

1560
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:35,520
I can't bear

1561
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,520
Hadiyaki

1562
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:39,520
It's even minute 4.5 save

1563
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:40,520
Good morphe

1564
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:41,520
Adam Langeber

1565
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:46,520
We kill Faestah

1566
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:48,520
We kill Faestah

1567
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:49,520
We kill Faestah

1568
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:50,520
We kill Faestah

1569
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:52,520
Well, because the whole show was spoken in Dutch

1570
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:54,520
I left it out of this episode of Rand at Charlie

1571
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:55,520
No one would understand anyway

1572
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:56,520
So

1573
02:06:56,520 --> 02:07:01,520
But I'm sure our good friend got some great stories to tell you about that trip

1574
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:02,520
A soundtrack to your life

1575
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:04,520
From 1985

1576
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:06,520
The wrong chosen alarm's grave

1577
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:08,520
I guess was the same song

1578
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:10,520
As the soundtrack to your life from 2004

1579
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:12,520
The soundtrack to my life

1580
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:14,520
That is the young Dutchest moon

1581
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:15,520
In the morning everybody

1582
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:16,520
Bye bye now

1583
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:18,520
It's here's the train

1584
02:07:18,520 --> 02:07:20,520
It doesn't move

1585
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:23,520
Without she said

1586
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:27,520
But I knew I'd heard

1587
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:31,520
That stranger's voice before

1588
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:38,520
I turned to look into her eyes

1589
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:41,520
But she moved away

1590
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:46,520
She was standing in the rain

1591
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:51,520
Trying how to speak my name

1592
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:58,520
They say first love and on time

1593
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:05,520
The way to more of our memories

1594
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:09,520
In the tiny clouds

1595
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:13,520
We stumbled over once

1596
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:17,520
We long to hear

1597
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:23,520
We talked about the dreams we lost

1598
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:27,520
We all gave it up

1599
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:31,520
When I was still caught the light

1600
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:36,520
And she said it's from my mind

1601
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:40,520
As the last train

1602
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:44,520
Won't go to the moon

1603
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:48,520
Though some of the nights

1604
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:50,520
When we were young

1605
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:52,520
We practically

1606
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:58,520
We never done we would dream of

1607
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:03,520
Only dream of us

1608
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:06,520
And in our head

1609
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:08,520
We brought the sun

1610
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:11,520
We left our witnesses

1611
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:16,520
And there's a hope we will dream of

1612
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:20,520
Only dream of

1613
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:23,520
On there's a moon

1614
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:27,520
On there's a moon

1615
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:32,520
On there's a moon

1616
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:36,520
There's a moon

1617
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:57,520
On there's a moon

1618
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:14,520
I still hear

1619
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:16,520
We're surrounded

1620
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:19,520
The summer night

1621
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:27,520
It echoes in the waters of my heart

1622
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:33,520
The night we stood and waited

1623
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:37,520
For the days of train

1624
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:42,520
I've always been there to say

1625
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:46,520
All our chances went away

1626
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:51,520
Still remain on the road

1627
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:54,520
To thunder

1628
02:10:56,520 --> 02:10:59,520
The summer nights

1629
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:01,520
When we were young

1630
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:03,520
We practically

1631
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:09,520
We never done we would dream of

1632
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:13,520
Only dream of

1633
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:16,520
Only dream of

1634
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:19,520
We'll dream of

1635
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:21,520
We'll dream

1636
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:26,520
We'll trust as long as this differs

1637
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:30,520
All of our dreamers

1638
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:34,520
On there's a moon

1639
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:38,520
Our rain

1640
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:41,520
On there's a moon

1641
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:46,520
That was a good time there in the desert, the Dutch Marine.

1642
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:50,520
And boy, I have not heard this song in ages, my friend.

1643
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:53,520
I come to think of it, it was kind of soft.

1644
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:56,520
I don't know if it's really deserved to be a huge hit or not,

1645
02:11:56,520 --> 02:12:01,520
but I always like Dennis the young's voice, he of course is the voice of sticks.

1646
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:02,520
And hell yeah!

1647
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:09,520
So, um, I don't know if I can make...

1648
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:14,520
Three hours complete today as we like to do only roll out of the other stores code

1649
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:17,520
because I do have to pick up the mini human resource.

1650
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:22,520
Christina, I got the kid working for me later on today.

1651
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:25,520
We're going to be doing some big app show episodes.

1652
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:30,520
So, uh, I do have to cut out pretty soon.

1653
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:34,520
But, just looking at the tracks that are coming in, I'm not quite done yet.

1654
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:36,520
No worries.

1655
02:12:36,520 --> 02:12:42,520
And thank you very much Ray Ray on the Charlie for this fantastic Ray on the Charlie episode number 60.

1656
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:44,520
But we think...

1657
02:12:44,520 --> 02:12:49,520
And you can catch Ray right here live on the stream every single Monday and Wednesday and 12.

1658
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:55,520
The specific time that it's get my nation westtime with this Ray on the Charlie hour and a half extra of again.

1659
02:12:55,520 --> 02:13:09,520
Made a girl, thought she was grand, fell in love, found out first and went well for a week or two.

1660
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:13,520
Then it all came on glue.

1661
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:22,520
Then a trap, a trip I can't grab, never thought I'd be the one who'd save.

1662
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:26,520
Then I started real life.

1663
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:33,520
I was really in one big life, she fucking hates me.

1664
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:36,520
Just fucking hates me.

1665
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:45,520
La la la, I tried to hone in, she told my feelings like I had none.

1666
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:51,520
And with them away, she was queen for about an hour.

1667
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:57,520
And now I'm left at the end, she can't sell her.

1668
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:01,520
She took all I ever had.

1669
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:06,520
No side of guilt, no feeling a plan, no.

1670
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:14,520
In a trap, trip I can't grab, never thought I'd be the one who'd save.

1671
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:19,520
Then I started real life.

1672
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:25,520
Then I was really in one big life, she fucking hates me.

1673
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:29,520
Just fucking hates me.

1674
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:37,520
La la la la, I tried to hone in, she told my feelings like I had none.

1675
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:41,520
And with them away.

1676
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:58,520
La la la, I tried to hone in, she told my feelings like I had none.

1677
02:14:58,520 --> 02:15:07,520
That's my story as you see, learn my lesson and so did she.

1678
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:13,520
Now it's over, and I'm glad, because I'm a fool.

1679
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:18,520
But I said she fucking hates me.

1680
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:21,520
Just fucking hates me.

1681
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:30,520
La la la la, I tried to hone in, she told my feelings like I had none.

1682
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:37,520
Now it's over, and I'm glad, because I'm a fool.

1683
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:48,520
La la la la la, I tried to hone in, she told my feelings like I had none.

1684
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:53,520
That's my story as you see, learn my feelings like I had none.

1685
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:57,520
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

1686
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:02,520
This Mickey just walked into the hilltop watch tower, crackpot, command center studios, and said,

1687
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:05,520
Oh, luckily, you played that song after I left.

1688
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:08,520
Right, okay, baby, I got it.

1689
02:16:08,520 --> 02:16:13,520
I've got to get off of the radio here and get some other things done, but a few more tracks before I leave.

1690
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:18,520
You're a fool, bar Friday.

1691
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:21,520
Nothing like a little bit of prints on a Friday afternoon.

1692
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:26,520
You got the look.

1693
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:33,520
I've never seen a pretty good look for a car, baby.

1694
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:38,520
You got that look.

1695
02:16:38,520 --> 02:16:42,520
Call your picture black, call me checking her back.

1696
02:16:42,520 --> 02:16:44,520
Pressure.

1697
02:16:44,520 --> 02:16:47,520
Make out what you're doing.

1698
02:16:47,520 --> 02:16:50,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1699
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:53,520
You're a fool, bar Friday.

1837
02:28:37,260 --> 02:28:39,260
She says it's a cave I'll come here

1838
02:28:39,260 --> 02:28:41,260
From above

1839
02:28:41,260 --> 02:28:43,260
Don't need to fuck it up

1840
02:28:43,260 --> 02:28:45,260
We've got a thing

1841
02:28:45,260 --> 02:28:47,260
That's a hole

1842
02:28:47,260 --> 02:28:49,260
Read our love

1843
02:28:49,260 --> 02:28:51,260
We've got a way in here

1844
02:28:53,260 --> 02:28:55,260
Read our love

1845
02:29:15,260 --> 02:29:17,260
That really sucks man

1846
02:29:17,260 --> 02:29:19,260
Is someone like delete the track

1847
02:29:19,260 --> 02:29:21,260
While I was playing it

1848
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:23,260
This is no good

1849
02:29:23,260 --> 02:29:25,260
That's not how we end the show

1850
02:29:25,260 --> 02:29:27,260
Oh man

1851
02:29:27,260 --> 02:29:29,260
It didn't happen throughout the whole program

1852
02:29:29,260 --> 02:29:33,260
Let me see if I can find something else and end the show up

1853
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:35,260
Ah

1854
02:29:35,260 --> 02:29:37,260
I totally blows

1855
02:29:37,260 --> 02:29:39,260
You harsh my mellow

1856
02:29:39,260 --> 02:29:41,260
We're gonna do now

1857
02:29:41,260 --> 02:29:43,260
It looks like it's still in there

1858
02:29:43,260 --> 02:29:45,260
Maybe the track was just busted

1859
02:29:47,260 --> 02:29:49,260
Well, we'll play this one then

1860
02:29:49,260 --> 02:29:50,260
Who knows?

1861
02:29:51,260 --> 02:29:53,260
I'm the only gay asking mode

1862
02:29:55,260 --> 02:29:57,260
I'm the only one I know

1863
02:29:57,260 --> 02:30:01,260
I'm the only gay asking mode

1864
02:30:01,260 --> 02:30:03,260
The my try

1865
02:30:05,260 --> 02:30:07,260
I'd go out seal hunting

1866
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:09,260
With my best friend Tarka

1867
02:30:09,260 --> 02:30:11,260
But all I want to do is get into his park

1868
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:15,260
I'm the only gay asking mode

1869
02:30:15,260 --> 02:30:17,260
In my try

1870
02:30:17,260 --> 02:30:19,260
Well

1871
02:30:19,260 --> 02:30:21,260
Me and Knuckfluck Chuck Buck

1872
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:23,260
We both like blubber

1873
02:30:23,260 --> 02:30:27,260
But me I've got this crazy fetish for Robert

1874
02:30:27,260 --> 02:30:29,260
I'm the only gay asking mode

1875
02:30:29,260 --> 02:30:31,260
In my try

1876
02:30:31,260 --> 02:30:33,260
I'm the only gay asking mode

1877
02:30:33,260 --> 02:30:35,260
I'm the only gay asking mode

1878
02:30:35,260 --> 02:30:37,260
I'm the only gay asking mode

1879
02:30:37,260 --> 02:30:39,260
I'm the only gay asking mode

1880
02:30:39,260 --> 02:30:41,260
In my try

1881
02:30:41,260 --> 02:30:43,260
And the seals they sing

1882
02:30:43,260 --> 02:30:45,260
In my try

1883
02:30:45,260 --> 02:30:47,260
And the seals they sing now

1884
02:30:53,260 --> 02:30:55,260
These co-winter nice

1885
02:30:55,260 --> 02:30:57,260
I're taking their toll

1886
02:30:57,260 --> 02:30:59,260
I even get excited

1887
02:30:59,260 --> 02:31:01,260
When I see the Lord

1888
02:31:01,260 --> 02:31:03,260
Poor

1889
02:31:03,260 --> 02:31:07,260
Me and Knuckfluck

1890
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:09,260
I'm the only gay asking mode

1891
02:31:09,260 --> 02:31:11,260
I'm the only one I know

1892
02:31:11,260 --> 02:31:13,260
They only one I know

02:31:13,260 --> 02:31:15,260
Me and Knuckfluckoof

02:31:15,260 --> 02:31:17,260
We both like blubber

1895
02:31:17,260 --> 02:31:19,260
When Knuckfluckuckuck sir

1896
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:21,260
I'd like the proklers with singet

1897
02:31:21,260 --> 02:31:23,260
I'm the only gay asking mode

1898
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:25,260
But the only gaynego

1899
02:31:25,260 --> 02:31:29,260
I'm the only gay asking mode

1900
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:33,260
In my try

1901
02:31:33,260 --> 02:31:35,260
Like Blub up Dillon

1902
02:31:35,260 --> 02:31:38,260

1903
02:31:38,260 --> 02:31:39,260

02:31:39,260 --> 02:31:41,780
Go, League games, people?

1905
02:31:42,780 --> 02:31:45,460
It's like recalled casing from the cards,

1906
02:31:45,660 --> 02:31:47,760
and the only day s, didn't ever come up,

1907
02:31:48,260 --> 02:31:49,860
Oh, no, no!

1908
02:31:50,060 --> 02:31:51,220
One more burger.

1909
02:31:51,360 --> 02:31:53,140
Oh, they're money gaiere,

1910
02:31:53,340 --> 02:31:54,140
to keep going.

1911
02:31:54,340 --> 02:31:56,520
And you just need to buy her,

1912
02:31:56,640 --> 02:31:58,700
I love you, I like all of you else's.

1913
02:31:58,900 --> 02:32:02,680
I'm the only guy I scalded.

1914
02:32:02,820 --> 02:32:05,560
Like Van Morrison.

1915
02:32:05,900 --> 02:32:06,540
Hell, yes, bones.

1916
02:32:06,540 --> 02:32:09,540
I only gave him a long time.

1917
02:32:09,540 --> 02:32:12,540
I haven't seen it going on this game.

1918
02:32:12,540 --> 02:32:15,540
I'm gonna turn it this early.

1919
02:32:15,540 --> 02:32:18,540
Jesus Christ fit in there somehow as well.

1920
02:32:18,540 --> 02:32:20,540
The track was good.

1921
02:32:36,540 --> 02:32:39,540
I'm gonna turn it this early.
