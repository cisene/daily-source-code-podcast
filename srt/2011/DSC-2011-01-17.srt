I'm a genius, it's true

19
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,060
But I'm a genius, I'm a genius

29
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,060
Yeah

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,060
It's me

31
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,060
I'm a genius

32
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,060

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

41
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:37,160

42
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,740
realize that yellow given who showed to Edward

43
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,700
minute ran an hour lane, which is actually good

44
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,700
because I caught it on the way back, driving down

45
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,740
the Pacific Coast Highway and like,

46
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,980
only crap that sounds like a real radio stage

47
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,180
that I wanna be on it.

48
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,580
I'll be sure sky, held it in light,

49
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,700
blowing in a room, and fur from white,

50
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,040
spinning around to how long it goes,

51
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,100
the cello is there, whatever I do.

52
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,140
The river is loaded, I've been there two days.

53
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,300
Took it some questions, but she doesn't your game.

54
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,300
I die in your arms, if you dare to hear come alive,

55
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,380
we rise to you.

56
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,780
Go up and falling down,

57
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,900
stretch away away away away away away away away away away

58
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,940
away from the sun, you don't leave the cave.

59
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,420
It's here, I'm on it, but,

60
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,740
burns out, it's all I can pull on,

61
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,300
and it's reliable, and it'll be still,

62
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,680
the little bit, KILL!

63
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,840
Bigger, your game!

64
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,460
Live with you cork

65
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,240
COMING FROM YOU

66
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,240
and they've food, some are as winter and new, all in new.

67
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Going up and coming down,

68
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,240
I should wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

69
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,240
I can smile and be no longer in the game.

70
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,240
Sailor of the frames are here,

71
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,240
For now to sit on, stand here,

72
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Sailor of the frames are here,

73
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
For now to sit on,

74
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
And on and on, and on,

75
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,240
And on and on.

76
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,240
The world is

77
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Another world

78
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,240
The world is

79
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:33,540
Stop till now complaining

80
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,260
It's cold, láting chaetsu will allow me

81
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,000
Take it to a volunteer, dah kill you

82
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,620
Watch, that kill you, damn

83
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:51,820
The summer could walk along through the little means of chaos

84
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:59,740
Terradore burned off an endless leadander

85
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,860
Terraz who's afraid not to get on it all

86
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:16,860
Oh, yeah, nothing like a little bit of bush on the Monday night A fellows.

87
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,860
It's the little things to count.

88
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,860
Today resource code, I think we're after start in five and he kind of lost count.

89
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,860
That's the first seven or eight hundred episodes.

90
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,860
That signal has been initiated so we're getting all the human resources.

91
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,860
Hopefully hanging out in the chat room.

92
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,860
Just wanted to give a little update on what's been happening.

93
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,860
There's so much cool stuff going on.

94
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,860
We do know agenda stream.com that I just, as I said, I was just listening to this stuff in the car.

95
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,860
I'm like, oh my god, we've got something so amazing going on.

96
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,860
If you have not logged in to know agenda chat.net,

97
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,860
I'll tell you a bit about the cool things you can do.

98
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,860
It's a manic Monday episode of the Charlie.

99
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,860
With Prince.

100
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,860
I guess I just won't get paid.

101
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,860
These are the days when you wish that everything was already made.

102
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,860
I just didn't have a man in one day.

103
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,860
I wish he was something new.

104
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,860
That's my fun day.

105
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,860
But I don't have to run away.

106
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,860
Just another man in one day.

107
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,860
I have to catch him out and trade.

108
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,860
I have to think you were by my mind.

109
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:10,860
If I hadn't ever paid us to keep making it on time.

110
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,860
I guess it takes me so long just to be here.

111
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,860
And where I'm all the way.

112
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,860
Leave it on the train, like the buses already there.

113
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,860
It's just another man in one day.

114
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,860
I wish he was something new.

115
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,860
Because that's my fun day.

116
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,860
But I don't have to run away.

117
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,860
Just another man in one day.

118
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,860
All of the less what you might know about.

119
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,860
What you think of this and that you give down.

120
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,860
That's everything now.

121
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,860
Doesn't matter.

122
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,860
I just think about the person on the star.

123
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,860
Now just a good example of how cool this open source radio project really is.

124
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,860
So I say not the bad signal that we've got to improv two manic Monday.

125
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,860
Daily source code going on immediately grow tells me on my screen here that

126
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,860
Oh, there's a new file dropped in my box.

127
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,860
A French with manic Monday.

128
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,860
The shit you never hear on the radio because they always play the bangles.

129
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,860
You know what I'm saying?

130
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,860
Never ever do you hear these versions.

131
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,860
This kind of stuff.

132
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,860
So I miss Mickey says, hey, let's go out and let's cruise around.

133
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,860
It's Martin Luther King day here in the United States of Gitmo Nation.

134
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,860
Okay, so that's good.

135
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,860
You know, I had the blade work on some episodes.

136
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,860
So I had everything up.

137
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,860
It really didn't have that much to do and I made sure the stream was playing as much open source

138
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,860
Daily source code music as possible.

139
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,860
We're still working on the actual scheduling and making the thing kind of work,

140
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:08,860
which failed obviously as the yellow's show normally at 330 Gitmo Nation West time

141
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,860
didn't start until 430 had handed over his Dropbox to Edward.

142
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,860
But I'm listening to the show.

143
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,860
I'm like, oh my god, this is so amazing.

144
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,860
You know, it's so hard to tell you coming from traditional radio.

145
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,860
How awesome it is.

146
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,860
What's happening here.

147
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,860
But I'm going to attempt to anyway.

148
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,860
And so anyway, so so you have to understand that when I was 15, I built my first radio transmitter.

149
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,860
And my mom drive me around the block and hear how far the signal could go.

150
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,860
And here I am 30 years later, 31 years later.

151
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:48,860
And I'm literally driving around with my iPhone connected to my car stereo with one of those cassettes.

152
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,860
You know, you put it into the machine, which invariably pops out from time to time and just ejects it.

153
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,860
And I'm listening to like, you know, better sound.

154
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,860
The quality is great.

155
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,860
It's CD quality.

156
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,860
It reaches all over these Gitmo Nation states almost everywhere.

157
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,860
Pacific Coast Highway has a brown spot here there.

158
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,860
You know, well, has more than one brown spot.

159
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:15,860
But like an AT&T brown spot where to drop back to GPS or edge network or whatever.

160
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,860
And so that cut out for a second.

161
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,860
But like, oh my god, we're actually doing it.

162
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,860
And it's not like controlled by one entity.

163
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,860
It's not certainly not something as big as a clear channel.

164
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,860
But it's not controlled by one person.

165
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,860
It's like something we're all doing together.

166
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,860
Truly is open source.

167
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,860
And you can contribute to this.

168
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,860
And that opportunity is coming up just days from now.

169

304
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:21,540
all come together and we've created this little community where we are going to be able

305
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:27,940
to create a radio station that not only entertains, delights, but has enough serendipity

306
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:33,020
in it that you'll go, huh, I haven't heard that song in a while, or hey, what the heck is

320
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:15,880
I didn't wanna, he won't, won't you filter, he said

321
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,280
One, one, one, one is three

322
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,280
Got to be good looking cause he is so hard to see

323
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:33,280
Come together, right now, all of me

324
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:45,660
Oh

325
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,660
I don't think I can do it

326
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:58,660
Yeah, yeah, I don't think I can do it

327
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,660
I don't think I can do it

328
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:11,660
I don't think I can do it

329
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,660
In the morning, those of you who get my nation very wet down under

330
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,660
Just waking up I guess

331
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,660
And a very good evening to those of you who get my nation

332
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,660
United States of Europe

333
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,660
Some of you in the lowlands up very, very late

334
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,660
So you haven't been around what we're doing for a while

335
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,660
We're still using the Dropbox system to share music

336
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,660
We've got the open source daily source code freestyle Dropbox

337
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,660
Which if you do not know how to join that, hop in the chat and ask

338
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,660
Get mostly of anyone else to be more than happy to help you out

339
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,660
And let you know exactly what to do

340
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,660
When you drop music in there, it eventually shows up on the stream

341
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,660
Sometimes immediately sometimes within the next hour or so

342
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,660
And this is a very interesting experiment in human psyche

343
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,660
Not only are you self-managing what goes on the stream

344
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,660
But also from a radio broadcasting perspective

345
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,660
I'm seeing what's coming in with people or deleting

346
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:16,660
And now with some of the excellent Doug, Doug like and hate

347
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,660
Functionality

348
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:23,660
We can start to put things on that your peers

349
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,660
And you're fellow, well, I'll call you Chuckleheads right now

350
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,660
Which you're liking

351
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,660
And it'll show up at other time zones for other people who wake up

352
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,660
You know, this is not like a radio station in one city

353
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,660
This is a radio station for one nation

354
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,660
We call it Get Monation

355
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,660
And what are we?

356
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,660

It's a shame.

572
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:32,660

00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:17,660
Such a shame, such a shame, this big and messed will break.

578
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,660
Just what's the reality?

579
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,660
I don't care.

580
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,660
Maybe it's a kind of a shame.

581
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,660
I feel I'm not sure.

582
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,660
It's a shame.

583
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,660
Such a shame.

584
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,660
I'm not made with rage.

585
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,660
Such a shame.

586
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,660
Such a shame.

587
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,660
I'm not gonna be in the place.

588
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,660
Such a shame.

589
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,660
There's a bigger mystery change.

590
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,660
Such a shame.

591
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,660
Such a shame.

592
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,660
Such a shame.

593
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:46,860
So let's relax, I'll keep staying

594
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:50,860
May my heart don't know if I should change

595
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:55,660
A feeling of pressure, it's a shame

596
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:06,060
So let's relax, nobody will wait

597
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:12,060
It's a shame, it's such a shame

598
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:46,060
It's a shame, it's such a shame

599
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,060
Tonight for the manic Monday and Prompto edition

600
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:08,060
I'm rolling them out from the open source that the source code freestyle box

601
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,060
Now I'm not quite sure I could look at the logs but a lot of this has already been played today

602
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,060
But these are just coming in now

603
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,060
So if you got something drop it in there, if you don't know how to drop it

604
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:24,060
Talk to Gitmo Slaves and chat room will be more than happy to help you

605
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,060
I'm sure

606
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,060
And yeah, we're writing all this stuff up too

607
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:34,060
Make it easy

608
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,060
And the real question I have is whatever happens to these guys

609
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,060
My god, it's so freaking good

610
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:52,060
Particularly this 12 inch version talk talk

611
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,060
Such a shame here on the daily source code

612
00:43:54,060 --> 00:44:00,060
I'd say you might want to crank it up, I don't know

613
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,060
It's just a suggestion

614
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:34,060
It's a shame, it's such a shame

615
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:38,060
It's such a shame

616
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,060
It's such a shame

617
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,060
It's such a shame

618
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,060
It's such a shame

619
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,060

620
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,060

621
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,060
It's such a shame

622
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,060
It's such a shame

623
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,060
It's such a shame

624
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,060
It's such a shame

625
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,060
It's such a shame

626
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,060
Subscribe

627
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:14,060
So I'm thinking about keeping locked away behind my libs

628
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:20,060
I can feel it BLACK in three with each and every chance

629
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,020
I'm turning fair to times

630
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,060
something so on

631
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:30,060
I see that I was certain I've made up with a sound

632
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,060
And I can feel you

633
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,060
I can feel you

634
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,060
And it keeps me

635
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,060
Let me wake

636
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,060
Can you feel it free

637
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:45,060
My heart feels like you're in

638
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,060
I can feel you

639
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,060
I can feel you

640
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,060
And it keeps me

641
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,060
Let me wake

642
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,060
Can you feel it free

643
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:02,060
My heart feels like you're in

644
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:06,060
I can feel you

645
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:37,060
How am I supposed to feel about the things I've done?

646
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:43,060
I don't know if I should stay or turn around and run

647
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:48,060
I know that I heard your things will never be the same

648
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:52,060
The only love I ever knew I'd through it all the way

649
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,060
And I can feel you

650
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,060
And it keeps me

651
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:03,060
Can you feel it free

652
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,060
As dropped in the open source of any source code

653
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,060
Dropbox yellow cards, breathing

654
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,060
And then source code in five weeks

655
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,060
For the 17th of January 2011

656
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,060
The new sound of radio is here

657
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:19,060
It's the future

658
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:22,060
And it's great for DJs like me

659
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,060
We're all in lazy

660
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,060
Get on the do anything

661
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,060
Break the mic, walk in, turn it on

662
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,060
And there's a song

663
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,060
So playlists is ready to go

664
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,060
It's all set

665
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,060
I mean how good does it get

666
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,060
Not much better now

667
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,060
The trick is to automate it

668
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,060
So we don't have to have human resources running

669
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,060
24-7

670
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,060
Just have done through the rest

671
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,060
Okay

672
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,060
Rival screen

673
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,060
Not the Charlie

674
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,060
That is

675
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,060
Rocks

676
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,060
He's keeping him

677
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,060
He's keeping him

678
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,060
He's keeping him

679
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,060
Horses keep the horror

680
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,060
Jump, keep, keep, score

681
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,060
And trade us down and we trap

682
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,060
So just we'll all hunt better

683
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,060
Bitch, she's keeping it

684
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,060
Clash, she's keeping it

685
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,060
She's keeping it

686
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,060
And we'll use the plan

687
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,060
That's the way to stay

688
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,060
Yeah

689
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,060
Jump, hurry, let's go

690
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,060
And the show across

691
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,060
She's got a Dank safe over there

692
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah

693
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,060

Get your mouth out, get your rock song

728
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,760
You know I'm not getting my back to get to my side

729
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,760
Get to my side, get to my side, party

730
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,760
Get to my side, get to my side

731
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,760
Get to my side, party, get to my side

732
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,760
Don't you wonder where the cowbell is

733
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,760
I would love nothing more than do a little bit of cowbell

734
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,760
I'm already yelling so loud into the microphones

735
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,760
I think the neighbors would not appreciate that

736
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,760
if I was clangin' away

737
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,760
Thank you, darling. Oh, that's the first one for the show

738
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,760
Libations are in the house

739
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:44,760
There's a guy in the place that got better sweet place

740
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,760
And he goes by the name of that man, he's a good

741
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,760
His friend's calling him, he's runny, he's a man

742
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,760
He's runny by the place that I know I'm a man

743
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,760
Could he's refined his decline, he makes you feel fine

744
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,760
The very much relying on him, it's understood

745
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

746
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

He's a good guy, he's a good guy

00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

750
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

751
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

752
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

760
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,760
He's a good guy

761
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,760
He's a good guy

762
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,760
He's a good guy

763
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

764
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

765
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

766
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,760
He's that guy, he's that guy

769
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,760
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

770
00:52:46,760 --> 00:53:16,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

771
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:46,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

772
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

773
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,400
So here's an idea for you.

774
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,900
What if we had an app?

775
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,320
Or an iPhone, Android, Blackberry, whatever device should be for all

776
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,400
app phones, essentially, Nokia, what do you think of it?

777
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:06,840
Where you listen to the stream and you can just add something by saying,

778
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:10,280
hey, maybe I should add this one in and the DJ on duty,

779
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,160
which you open as Dropbox, and you just roll it right in,

780
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,200
or if it's an automated show, it would eventually get picked up.

781
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,400
Think about it for a second.

782
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,800
Some amazing shit we can do here, and all the APIs are all available,

783
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,600
everything's there.

784
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,400
The only thing that isn't quite there is the licensing for the music.

785
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,200
I like the fun.

786
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,000
I think as long as you don't have any money flowing through the system,

787
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,800
we'll be okay for a while, the minute it starts to scale, of course,

788
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,400
we'll get into some former trouble, but for now we're having a good time.

789
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,400
And I'm sure that human resources will be happy to fill in the out.

790
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,400
When I'm in county jail.

791
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,000
If that's got to get you out of the bank, you got to see outside,

792
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
can't afford packed, everything's cool and everything's smooth.

793
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,400
Hey, that's a water to the deli.

794
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,400
I give from the letter, she gives me the loot, the pocket of books and a wait,

795
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,400
that I found cute, and I said, baby, baby, baby.

796
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,400
Is this the comment you love thing happening to the baby, what?

797
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,400
Back in time, that's happy with the night that it's time to float,

798
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,400
start to go, go back to the line,

799
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,600
just keep this side in the light, not to try.

800
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,800
See, I'll remember the number one more, you know we never get forward.

801
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,600
Right now, eight-stop, the leaves drop, so we jump to the wall,

802
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,000
and pound in the cat, Steven's driving,

803
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
because I had to talk to my man once.

804
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,400
I don't know anything about any fucking setup.

805
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,800
Can't touch me all you want.

806
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,600
Torture you, that's your good idea.

807
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,400
Let's go.

808
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,400
Runnin' around, runnin' back.

809
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,400
So wait, don't be scared, Steven.

810
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,400
Now I don't even talk about the hell skating,

811
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
fucking a crowd, man, I'm still standing up straight,

812
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,400
so who put these jobs, make a little money,

813
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,400
no one gets hurt, if they don't act funny,

814
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,400
on the way to the yacht, you almost got caught.

815
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,400
That shootin' mail box, throw away the cops is here.

816
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,400
The act is up and throw us adjacent to my phone,

817
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,400
which is mail box, that's that good.

818
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,400
Makes the loaded, they give chase from our man's teams,

819
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,400
and eight family lost case brothers in the eighths,

820
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,400
and we cast it off and along,

821
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,400
we went off and knew the deal,

822
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,400
and how we saw it, we went dead.

823
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,400
Let's go, leave you cool.

824
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,400
Are you cool?

825
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,400
That's right, ready, killer white.

826
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,400
You got it, man.

827
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,400
Runnin' around, runnin' back.

828
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,400
So wait, don't be scared, Steven.

829
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,400
Let's go these next.

830
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,400
Moncento brings them to you.

831
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,400
Runnin' around, runnin' around.

832
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,400
Runnin' around, runnin' back.

833
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,400
So wait, don't be scared.

834
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,400
Runnin' around, runnin' back.

835
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,400
So wait, don't be scared.

836
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,400
Miss Mickey and I watched a food in-class night,

837
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,400
that was pretty frightening.

838
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,400
Runnin' around, runnin' back.

839
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,400
I actually had a stomachache out of that,

840
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,400
and not seen it yet, which was kind of weird.

841
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,400
So yeah, it looks like people are starting to figure out

842
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,400
some of the things that can be done,

843
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,400
if you wanted to,

844
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,400
actually, you know,

845
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,400
if you wanted to extend,

846
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,400
and make this open source ready,

847
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,400
or something, if anybody could get into,

848
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,400
not just someone who's sitting in front of a computer

849
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,400
with a Dropbox.

850
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,400
There's tons of ways you can interact with a Dropbox API,

851
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,400
and, uh,

852
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,400
we'll start figuring it out on our end.

853
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,400
We'll start figuring it out on our end.

854
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,400

We'll start figuring it out on our end.

868
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,400
We'll start figuring it out on our end.

869
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,400
We'll start figuring it out on our end.

870
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,400
We'll start figuring it out on our end.

871
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,400
We'll start figuring it out on our end.

872
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,400
We'll start figuring it out on our end.

873
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,400

We'll start figuring it out on our end.

877
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,400
We'll start finding it out on our end.

878
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,400
We'll start figuring it out on our end.

879
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,400
We'll start figuring it out on our end.

880
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,400
we'll start figuring it out on our end.

881
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,400
Serendent

882
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:02,400
Powered in the such mix you want to keep you under

883
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,400
What you want to spread on you

884
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,400
She's the body's angel

885
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:12,400
She's the body's angel

886
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,400
She's the body's angel

887
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,400
She's the body's angel

888
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,900
She's the people you leave upon her home

889
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,900
She�id star, my face

890
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,500
She's the beauty…

891
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,900
With I'll ot score

892
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:34,500
She's the beauty…

893
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,500
For I'll ot count around

894
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,900
She�id star, my face

895
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,500
She's the beauty…

896
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,900
With I'll scores

897
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,000
She's the Beauty…

898
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,400
Ah, I know, he's nice class of Dad

899
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,700
Here they're thinking, just how they've appreciated it

900
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:54,700
You might think it's hard to be sure for your life

901
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:03,700
You might think it's hard to be sure for your life

902
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,700
If you don't feed or leave my heart alone

903
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:14,700
Tears up to the face, across the day when I was born

904
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:21,700
I was born and I was born and I was born

905
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:26,700
I was born and I was born and I was born

906
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,700
Now as a professional radio pronounced a cater who has made a career out of it

907
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:34,700
I can tell you this is the most exciting thing to sit here in the studio

908
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,700
and just have the music being handed to you by your audience

909
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:41,700
You know we used to have this whole interface in between called it like a telephone

910
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,700
It have to request that it have to fit within the format

911
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,700
The station manager would have to allow you to do it

912
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,700
The music director would have to approve the song that could go on

913
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,700
That is the thing of the class

914
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,700
And now of course with the lineup systems we have

915
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,700
Literally anybody can become a DJ

916
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:02,700
You don't necessarily have to have the awesome voice

917
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,700
You know that was the prerequisite back in the day

918
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,700
That's what's changed

919
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,700
And if you don't want to do that

920
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,700
You just contribute to the shows

921
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:16,700
I can see where individual shows that have their own Dropbox line

922
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,700
I'm sure I'll open those up to friends and have people contribute those as well

923
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,700
We're going to build some really big here before

924
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,700
That I guarantee you

925
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,700
Now for instance I've never heard of Tiki Tane

926
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:30,700
But the track is now this is it fresh music from the Dropbox

927
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,700
Are you ready?

928
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,700
Are you ready?

929
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,700
That sounds like a...

930
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:47,700
Are you ready?

931
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,700
Are you ready?

932
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,700
Are you ready?

933
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,700
No.

934
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,700
My turn to bring a new song

935
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:58,700
I'm talking to Tiki Tane

936
01:01:58,700 --> 01:01:59,700
Show me if you're ready

937
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,700
My turn to bring a new song

938
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:03,700
And to Tiki Tane

939
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:04,700
Show me if you're ready

940
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,700
My turn to bring a new song

941
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:07,700
I'm talking to Tiki Tane

942
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,700
Show me if you're ready

943
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,700
My turn to bring a new song

944
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,700
I've been waiting here for ready to make my move

945
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:17,700
I know what's funny you hate

946
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,700
I said I'm coming through

947
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,700
I've been a new shit ready to K&N

948
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,700
You're my crew and we won't stop

949
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:23,700
To be the kid

950
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,700
And take it turn the rules

951
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:25,700
You know I can't contain it

952
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,700
I gotta tell the truth

953
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,700
It's going as my first refrain

954
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:29,700
I know cool up in the money

955
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,700
But came and hit the credit

956
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:31,700
Forgot that I wrote

957
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,700
And two for the love and hands

958
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:34,700
You can't hear what I got

959
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:35,700
I need a call to school

960
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,700
If it's you can't better than you

961
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:38,700
But be the fool

962
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:39,700
I take my message

963
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:40,700
And I use it out of my mind

964
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,700
The trick is not to let money come in and tear it apart

965
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,700
I am the natural ball killer sound boy

966
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,700
If you want to fuck with that we bring fake

967
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,700
Just like it, don't let out

968
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,700
Who's the law for me somewhere

969
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,700
I'll murder you

970
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,700
My turn to bring a new shit

971
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:55,700

01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:06,700
Show me if you're ready

979
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,700
My turn to bring a new song

980
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,700
You can't hear what I'm saying

981
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,700
Here we go again

982
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,700
Another face to join

983
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:15,700
Right above again

984
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,700
Oh, what you beside point

985
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:17,700
If you go as pop a land

986
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,700
Up in the dress stand

987
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:19,700
If you're here for a good time

988
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,700
Never forget you know

989
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,700
Tiki Tane

990
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,700
Missing your back and with my boys

991
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,700
You're on peace

992
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:25,700
From the mouth won't stay

993
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,700

And to some advice

1012
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,700
Why do you sleep with eyes?

Are you crazy?

1033
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:58,660
After I'm gone, your Earth will be free to live on its miserable state.

1034
