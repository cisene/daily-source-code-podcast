00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Delta Sierra Charlie 860, the SNFU Saturday edition for February 5th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,240
Between the innocence of an engineer and the dignity of a janitor,

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,400
we find a lovable monster called a disc jockey.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,840
This jockey is coming a certain size as weights and colors,

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,640
but all DJs have the same creed to bluff unknowingly as many commercials as possible in an eight-hour

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,920
script.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,640
This jockey is our found everywhere.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,040
Under turn tables, swinging from typewriters, climbing a disowned effects rack,

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,040
or jumping to attention at the approach of a program director.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,240
Their relatives love them, sponsors can't stand them, engineers ignore them,

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,200
but the listeners protect them.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,960
When you want to concentrate, a DJ is an inconsiderate but some intruding jangle of noise.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,160
A clown, when you want some music, he plays something fast,

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,600
and when you're in the mood for something heavy, bright and sparkling,

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,600
he always gives you a slow, serious, sticky, sweet bound.

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,600
A disc jockey is a composite.

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,440
He has the voice of a horse, the courage of a cast-per-milk post,

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,560
the imagination of an insect, the shyness of a politician, the lungs of a barter,

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,720
and all the energy he can get from Dr. Moon-Pinkles' little bipamantil.

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:33,920
He likes bat-mail, a day off, girls, comic books, his wife, his family, doll, fishing, girls,

21
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,440
comic books, phone calls, compliments, girls, comic books, and occasional kind

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,120
word with a light panel in the head. Girls, talent seeks, girls, compliments,

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,640
recognition, girls, comic books, time-off, girls, and comic books.

24
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,560
He's not much for working an expert day, words of more than free syllables, and certain musical units,

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,520
and nobody gets so much fun out of trees and dogs and time signals as he does.

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,400
A DJ is a lovable, wacky, real, cool character.

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,400
You can lock him out of your workshop, but you can't turn him off your neighbor's ready.

28
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,040
You can get him out of your study, but you can't get him off the airway,

29
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,840
so you might just as well give up. He's here to stay in many forms,

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,080
tall and short, thin and fat, neat and sloppy, beautiful, dulce tones and squeaky squealing.

31
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,320
Bonser dance is standing alive and half dead, good and bad.

32
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,080
But when the day is over and you get home with only the shattered pieces of your hopes and

33
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,320
dreams remaining after the day is puzzled. He can lend them all like you with those six magic words.

They say the water is sharing work, and all they've been drunk all the time

60
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:31,080
Sheriff Jackson, we're not the back, and now he's done us, all dressed in blue

61
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Tracing blue

62
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:47,080
Not a man, but a driver, where you are, there's a woman on the hill in a mud room

63
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:58,080
With a shotgun for the form, and a raise a pack for in the pack of a check-ups for a pack

64
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:15,080
I don't think I can hear you, I don't think I can hear you

65
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,080
I don't think I can hear you, I don't think I can hear you

66
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Travelling for me, oh, I'm afraid you'll be for a certain condition, a status quo

67
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Not a man, but a driver, where you are, there's a woman on the hill in a mud room

68
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,080
With a shotgun for the fall

69
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,080
There's a black plastic bag

70
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,080
Like a little bit of a surprise

71
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
CROVED to kick off

72

She said you know I'm gettin' all kinds of tweets for people say maybe he's gonna make some pancakes

Because the guy needs to do another show

169
00:12:43,880 --> 00:13:13,880

Yeah, yeah

170
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:26,160
Great to see commester vlogger in the chat if you're new to the Charlie and I can imagine

171
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,000
after 860 episodes there's still some people who've never heard of the program the way

172
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,400
we do it these days which is a far cry from the early days is with the chat room everyone

173
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,360
comes in live we hang out we drop tracks in the dropbox and we talk a little bit of

174
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,800
bold crap and commester vlogger did the pass on an entry which I'll be playing

175
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,000
free later which of course is another one of his excellent analyses of the

176
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,640
European Union my friends each burns while we're more concerned about the

177
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,680
Super Bowl yes I had a mind about the depression earlier this week more on

178
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,760
that in a bit

179
00:14:41,360 --> 00:15:06,380
a

180
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,380
You know what I mean?

181
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,380
But the world of actress watches

182
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,380
It's the world

183
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,380
I got it

184
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,380
So what's the way?

185
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,380
The life is short

186
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,380
And the hours always

187
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,380
So what?

188
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,380
The world?

189
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,380
I can read the drugs

190
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,380
And read it by the way

191
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,380
With a song

192
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,380
I'll die

193
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,380
And I'll hide the world

194
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,680
And you will anger

195
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,380
But the world of actress watches

196
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,380
It's the world

197
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,420
The world is made of

198
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,380
So what I mean?

199
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,380
I'll become the living

200
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,380
Pythas

201
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,380
Everything is Applause

202
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,380
Ignoreable

203
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,380
From I'll always And Display

204
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,380
The world.......

205
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,380
If the fireworks

206
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,380
And you will walk

207
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,480
And you have more

208
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,380
And the world of actress watches

209
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,380
What about the death tonight?

210
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,380
ament

211
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,380
It's time, life's over, life's over, life's over

212
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,380
Life's over, life's over, life's over

213
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,380
Life's over, life's over, life's over

214
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,380
Life's over, life's over, life's over

215
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,380
Life's over, life's over, life's over

216
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:23,380
Life's over, life's over

217
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:29,380
Life's over, life's over

218
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:35,380
Life's over, life's over

219
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,380
Life's over, life's over

220
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,380
Life's over, life's over

221
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:49,380
Life's over, life's over, life's over

222
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,380
Life's over, vida's over, life's over

223
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,380
Life's over, life's over

224
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,380
The rest of the scene is nothing,

225
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,380
It's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing.

226
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,380
The whole world will break into this world,

227
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,380
It's dust and the whole reality.

228
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,380
And the time will come alive.

229
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,380
The time will come alive.

230
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,380
The time will come alive.

231
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,380
Sisters of Mercy, we're just a top to the hands.

232
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,380
I'm over a house on the Temple of All,

233
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,380
but your daddy's door is going episode 86.

234
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,380
Zero, the snapper side of it, which means we will not be making

235
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,380
your ears bleed all the time.

236
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,380
We gotta bring it down a little bit in time,

237
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,380
I have to say,

238
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,380
the way I've been feeling recently looking at the news.

239
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,380
What's happening with slaves worldwide?

240
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,380
I kind of feel like I'm living at the corner of

241
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,380
dude and catastrophe.

242
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,380
How about you?

243
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,380
Who got by the pool again?

244
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,380
It's the play of the pool again.

245
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,380
What the whiffin' pool again?

246
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380
But on the grill that stinks,

247
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,380
kind of like burnt fur,

248
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,380
and rare to drink,

249
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,380
but an undertone of the acorn

250
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,380
and leather that's laid on,

251
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,380
thick like Liz Clayborn,

252
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,380
step over with thick trepidation,

253
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,380
lift up the top off the meat cooking station.

254
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,380
To discover my home and tie,

255
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,380
that's it, oh my god,

256
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,380
what brim facade,

257
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,380
to give me with them up,

258
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,380
waitfulness, I have too many sellers,

259
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,380
and they always crisp,

260
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,380
unless I rise up in the morning with my squirrel,

261
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,380
the sister from the world,

262
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,380
and sister does I get this instant,

263
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,380
and you're nothing again,

264
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,380
it's pretty mature,

265
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,380
if only we had the teamwork concur,

266
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,380
spoken with the tongs,

267
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,380
do won't wake up,

268
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,380
put them on the lawn,

269
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,380
raise a basket,

270
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,380
a steak up,

271
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,380
and they say,

272
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,380
no kind of miles are leaving,

273
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,380
got to get the high degree on,

274
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,380
toss on them on the pool,

275
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,380
got all but they all used up,

276
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,380
I'm a little sizable link,

277
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,380
nothing left to try,

278
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,380
phone and crystal,

279
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,380
my heart is pistol,

280
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,380
I mean it could break like crystal,

281
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,380
ain't never learned to whistle,

282
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,380
don't break,

283
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,380
it's cadaver up,

284
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,380
what's a matter with your mind?

285
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,380
he ain't a long cliff,

286
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,380
he's been knuckle heads since old times,

287
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
dig out the bat and helm and then the bat,

288
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,380
we're all about to have a funeral,

289
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,380
and that's that,

290
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,380
we'll do it after breakfast,

291
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,380
we'll do it after proper,

292
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,380
we'll drop all his ashes out the air,

293
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,380
we'll cop,

294
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,380
they're rusting in the dirt,

295
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,380
he's all spreading out blossoms,

296
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,380
and it's gonna flip up,

297
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,380
but the beef freaking awesome,

298
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,380
we're all living inside the same,

299
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,380
wasting my time,

300
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,380
to prove,

301
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,380
to prove,

302
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,380
to prove,

303
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,380
to prove,

304
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,380
to prove,

305
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,380
we're all living inside the same,

306
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,380
bout a guy,

307
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,380
we're我们 2 dead,

308
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,380
classroom,

309
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,380
six bomb rips lay the w closed gonna

310
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,380
the hell I bet saint around your再見,

311
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,380
one to wedms tell us that,

312
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,380
these dudes ain't?

313
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,380
II don't send a meant stole,

314
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,380
now I want to say a lil giving me something,

315
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,380
but a bit of laying card,

316
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,380
so the rest I call,

317
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,380
you get frustrated of aggression,

318
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,380
they're like the eagle got to do,

319
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,380
they'll passed out on the barbeque,

320
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,380
charging on the brand for most of my images,

321
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,380
while I can turn around,

322
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,380
the life it's great with a less than envy.

323
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,800
With the less than it, jelly, traffic and black toss

324
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,680
Mac, and psychedelics in that little ass

325
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,200
Man, the his and drunk, doing it

326
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,760
No one with the right thing to do was

327
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,240
But a showing it, hidden soon, pretty probable

328
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,640
Plears are all the bullheads

329
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,160
The duty that's hot, oh, oh, not just in death

330
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,760
But in after that, like the bat

331
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,640
Out the HG double, hurt a cool slack

332
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,320
But in mound, in the case of this road

333
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,840
It's like when he got killed, out on it's loaded

334
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,040
Or in back, when he got shamed in the joint

335
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,680
And the cause we need to wonder if it's easy

336
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,760
To the point, to my shepherd, the tending of his life's ending

337
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,440
Up that he's chilling at friendlies

338
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
And gonna be back in the neighborhood shortly

339
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,060
Discussing how awesome it is to be

340
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,460
Fortly reporting the slant that he just got on with

341
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,120
Listener, drink to his risks, hurt

342
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,500
Going to ghost in your sister

343
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
To the bucket kicks to when he asked me

344
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,540
And this one wasn't like I'm asking

345
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,500
So yes, we're depressed, but not dressed

346
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,140
We leave it in the corner of doing catastrophe

347
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,980
Where I'm living inside the same

348
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,240
Where's the mudtime, I'm not to prove it

349
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:53,180
You know, it may not help a lot

350
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,280
If you want to support the artist that are playing at a daily source code

351
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,080
I believe no agenda entertainment.com is updating the track

352
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,280
Listening in real time

353
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,080
Of course, if you're in the chat room, you can vote on the tracks

354
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,960
Good old Gungus, stupid track of stuff the way Dungu does

355
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,520
You know, Dungu, he's the guy that tracks all of our

356
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,160
Everything in the chat room, no agenda stream.com, no agenda chat.net

357
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,120
Stand by, we'll be breaking things down just a minute

358
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,120
I'm a loser

359
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,640
And I'm not what I appear to be

360
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,000
I've all a love, I have one, or have lost

361
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,280
There is one love I should never have crossed

362
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,640
She was a girl and a million, my friend

363
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,960
I should have known she would win in the end

364
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,680
I'm a loser

365
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,640
And I love someone who needs to meet

366
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,280
I'm a loser

367
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,880
And I'm not what I appear to be

368
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,160
All the way left and I act like a clown

369
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,600
Then eat this mask, I am wearing a crown

370
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,960
Matty is all falling like rain from the sky

371
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,280
Is it for her or myself that I cry

372
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,920
I'm a loser

373
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,800
And I love someone who needs to meet

374
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,520
I'm a loser

375
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,880
And I'm not what I appear to be

376
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:18,240
What have I done to deserve such a bait?

377
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,600
I realize I have left it too late

378
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,960
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall

379
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,200
I'm telling you so that you won't lose

380
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,920
I'm a loser

381
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,960
And I love someone who needs to meet

382
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,520
I'm a loser

383
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,120
And I'm not what I appear to be

384
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,160
For those lesser known tracks from the Beatles

385
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,800
Which you can probably find on iTunes

386
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,720
For free here no agenda stream.com

387
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,080
I'm a loser on your daily source code episode 860

388
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,760
It is the Snapfoo Saturday edition

389
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,840
In the morning to everybody who is listening

390
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,080
And in the morning to everyone in the chat room of course

391
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,120
And I have to say it was weird this week

392
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,080
As of course I've had CNN on for most of the time

393
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,640
Trying to pop back and forth between that and C-SPAN

394
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
As you know John C to work and I

395
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,880
Watch C-SPAN so you don't have to

396
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,320
Which is harder than it sounds actually sometimes

397
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,840
And a suddenly from a metal level I got this oh my god look at what's happening

398
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,160
Because obviously what's going on in Egypt is real

399
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,600
And people are really pissed off and they're really coming out

400
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,840
And of course we know that anything we're seeing here in the media is slanted

401
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
Twisted

402
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,000
It's the Ministry of Truth so and I don't read Egyptian or Arabic for that matter

403
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,640
Or whatever language may be blogged or Facebook

404
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,280
No one is actually pointed out a Facebook page to me that shows the true voice of the people

405
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,640
There's all kinds of

406
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,400
Shills who are running around there so we really don't exactly know what's going on on the ground

407
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,520
One thing for sure it's not Anderson Cooper Vanderbilt bringing you the truth

408
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:14,560
That just doesn't feel right and too bad that Christian Ampour has been co-opted by ABC and CNN

409
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,400
Maybe she just felt like retiring didn't want to do the real stuff anymore

410
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Used to be a big fan of what she did

411
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,680
But at a metal level I was looking at all this stuff and like you know

412
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:31,040
We really don't deserve any better. We let ourselves be treated like slaves and when you are treated like a slave and you and

413
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:37,680
Respond like one then you need some global elites who are going to move you around and point you in the direction that is necessary

414
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,640
And this became really depressing to me because I'm like you know

415
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,200
If we were really truly left to our own means to be human beings

416
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:52,000
With all the love and and beauty that we have in in ourselves inherently the world would be a very different place

417
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,360
I'm convinced of it, but no because we allow this to happen

418
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,080
Because we allow ourselves to be moved and manipulated and

419
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,680
Steered in every direction and we accept it we both Hika they say and get monation east

420
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,800
Bend over here it comes again because we let all that happen

421
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
We deserve to be moved and and

422
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
Control by the elites and

423
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,640
I was thinking what part do I want to play in that moving forward in the future?

424
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,320
I'm gonna turn 47 this year. What am I gonna do? How are we gonna do it? Can we do stuff with

425
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,280
No agenda can we really make a dent?

426
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,280
Well, maybe a little bit does it start one person at a time

427
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,360
Can we do things with the music we play can we start to

428
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,800
Bring our own mind control back into the equation?

429
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,160
I'm really not feeling too good about the direction this has had it for three four years now

430
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,160
I've been saying that this shit is gonna happen and now it's here. I'm getting scared

431
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,800
I've been saying that this shit is gonna happen and now it's here.

432
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:28,640
I miss the steps in which I need to take

433
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:35,640
I realize we'll be free from this violence in the rage

434
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:42,640
You might as well pass it through

435
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Now break it through

436
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,640
And now break it through

437
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:03,640
Now break it through

438
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:13,640
Now break it through

439
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,640
Now break it through

440
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,640
Now break it through

441
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,640
Now break it through

442
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:33,640
Now break it through

443
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,640
Now break it through

444
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,640
Now break it through

445
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:46,640
And we can see

446
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,640
And we can see

447
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,640
Now we're falling

448
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,640
We can see

449
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,640
That's right, slaves, make sure your cheapest firmly implanted

450
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,640
Make sure you're here in the voices in your head

451
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,640
We're all in K.O.T.

452
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
You can save

453
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,640
No, it's true

454
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Here was on the Charlie

455
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,640
Gotta say there was another thing that kind of bothered me

456
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,640
I was spent the day yesterday with a charity

457
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,640
The Mickey and I do work for

458
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,640
And their largest donor by far

459
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,640
Who was a medical venture capitalist of in San Francisco

460
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,640
He actually told them

461
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,640
That he saw the future of the United States

462
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,640
It's a very bleak future

463
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,640
And he's actually going to New Zealand

464
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,640
To look at a house to buy for his escape

465
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,640
I know this guy and I'm like, wow, really?

466
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
That's his plan?

467
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,640
I thought Australia was the place to be

468
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Maybe we need less people and more sheep

469
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
Could be the plan for me

470
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,640
That's where all zombies

471
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:22,640
And the other hand is the only child we know slowly

472
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,640
Take care

473
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
And the violence

474
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,640
Concepts, violence

475
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,640
We are, we must take care

476
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,640
Many you see, it's not me

477
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,640
It's not my family

478
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,640
It's not my family

479
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,640
It's not my family

480
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:55,640
But it's your letter

481
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,640
It's your letter

482
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,640
It's not my family

483
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:33,640
I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here

484
00:32:33,640 --> 00:33:03,640
I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am there, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, here, I am here, here, here, here, I am here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here

485
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:12,120
We must be worth it again, it's the same oldie

486
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:17,880
There's 9, 16, in your head, in your head

487
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,880
There's still fire with their tanks, and their bombs

488
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,320
And their bombs, and their guns in your head

489
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:35,560
There's still fire with their tanks, and their guns in your head

490
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:47,000
There's still fire with their tanks, and their guns in your head

491
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,240
There's still fire with their tanks, and their guns in your head

492
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:07,480
There's still fire with their tanks, and their guns in your head

493
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:27,000
There's still fire with their tanks, and their guns in your head

494
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
There's still fire with their tanks, and their guns in your head

495
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:41,000
There's still fire with their tanks, and their guns in your head

496
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:51,000
There's still fire with their tanks, and their guns in your head

497
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:01,000
