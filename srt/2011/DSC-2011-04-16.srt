Altarcherard Charlie eight six two-snap-whoo

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,820
Saturday

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,720
Will 16 won season ends in chewing 5 9s a time

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,500
Make the 25 cinch will await those thoughts

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,500
I no였 in this drifting

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,540
It's a new theory

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,740
I wanna know you'll drive

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,180
Want the ball on the they sick?

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,180
On the wall, maybe crash my car, I make me feel safety too

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,180
On the dark, on the wall, whatever it is

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:44,180
On the wall, maybe I'm out too dark, I make my eyes too red

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,180
On the wall, maybe nervous, what do you want to do?

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,180
On the next day, feel like I've seen when I was you

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:01,180
When I don't know with you

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,180
On the new adrenaline, on the wall, spill

16
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,180
On the dark, on the wall, maybe crash my car, I make my eyes too red

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,180
On the wall, maybe crash my car, I make my eyes too red

18
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,180
On the wall, maybe I'm out too dark, I make my eyes too red

19
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,180
On the wall, maybe nervous, what do you want to do?

20
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,180
On the next day, feel like I've seen when I was you

21
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:45,180
On the wall, maybe crash my car, I make my eyes too red

22
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:52,180
On the wall, maybe I'm out too dark, I make my eyes too red

23
00:01:52,180 --> 00:02:01,180
On the wall, maybe I'm out too dark, I make my eyes too red

24
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:10,180
On the wall, maybe I'm out too dark, I make my eyes too red

25
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,180
On the wall, maybe I'm out too dark

26
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,180
On the wall, maybe I'm out too dark

27
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:29,180
I feel like I've seen when I was you

28
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,180
Some time it's external options

29
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:50,180
I want a new drive, going all the doubts, when I'm all maybe talk too much, I'm in my face, break down.

30
00:02:50,180 --> 00:03:01,180
What a moment you never saw, what it was to, when that makes me feel like I feel and I can't do.

31
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,180
I'm alone with you.

32
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,180
Actually, it's nothing better than doing a show life, still in your repertoire.

33
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,180
It's, you know what I'm saying?

34
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,180
What passes for progeny?

35
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,180
It's a number of things.

36
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,180
First of all, I had no corporate cock sucking today.

37
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,180
Which is nice.

38
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:28,180
Let's see a little bit of motivation there from Rey, who sent in some art work for the Snap Food Saturday.

39
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,180
And he's been dropping some songs on the Dropbox.

40
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:40,180
But I also have to say it was kind of right-know-the-bearded who, uh, I was listening to a show yesterday as I was doing some errands around Los Angeles with the top-down crews in the round.

41
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,180
Listen to his, uh, fuck you Friday.

42
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,180
And he said, you know how I'm saying?

43
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,180
You don't want to be so angry, you've got to do a show.

44
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,180
Kind of let off steams.

45
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,180
Again, that makes a lot of sense.

46
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,180
Number four hits too high to steal this dude.

47
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,180
A little pretty.

48
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,180
A pretty one.

49
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,180
When you go to give me some time, it's your honor.

50
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,180
We have this fun motor.

51
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,180
A motor.

52
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,180
Cool, a little bit of other.

53
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,180
I ain't your honor.

54
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,180
There's the motor stop.

55
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,180
Give it up.

56
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,180
Set it dirty, my dad always get it up.

57
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,180
Hold it tight.

58
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:19,180
I'll think of the kind, my, my, my, my, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.

59
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,180
Come on, little closer.

60
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,180
All the other.

61
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,180
Close the little, looking my eyes.

62
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,180
You're older.

63
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,180
Keep it in the mystery.

64
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,180
Just to make it run and down.

65
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,180
Like the night's dying.

66
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,180
You're older.

67
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,180
Yeah, but don't this stop.

68
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,180
Give it up.

69
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,180
Touch it dirty, my dad always get it up.

70
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,180
Hold it tight.

71
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,180
Hold it tight, I, the other.

72
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,180
Left hand, my, I, my, I, yeah.

73
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,180
Whoa!

74
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,180
Move it, move it, myamt, yeah.

75
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,180
Move it, myamt, myamt, yeah.

76
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:39,180
When you look into me, it's a me, is it just a matter of time and sugar, is it just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a me, it's just a

78
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:37,340

79
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,260
Tell me, Don't speak on shit

You know it is exactly true. That's all the exercise you need just a little bit of cowbell and the at least my biceps are in tune

111
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,340
And I can't say much for the gut that I'm asked for these days

112
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,340
And of course I have to say now the reason is miss Mickey's out on the road so she needs something to listen to well that's what I'm here for

113
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:05,540
And if I decide, come home and take a free ride

114
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,540
Oh

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:42,540
So leave the night, How got to take us to paradise,

172
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,540
How got to take us to paradise,

173
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,540
How got to take us to paradise,

174
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,540
How got to take us to paradise,

175
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,540
We got a couple of tickets to paradise,

176
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,540
Baby cannot wait for the knowledge and the connection

177
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,540
to our high pockets across America

178
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,540
To total tickets to paradise,

179
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,540
Oh, we don't have wheels yet, but we got the tickets

180
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,540
And I cannot wait, it's going to be a lot of fun.

181
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,540
I have a feeling we'll meet guys like Eddie Money,

182
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,540
So we're on the road, doing some kind of roadhouse gay, you know?

183
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,540
I wonder where those guys all are.

184
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,540
Now, of course, it's not from Saturdays intended,

185
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,540
Not to make your ears bleed,

186
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,540
But just a kind of like getting a little bit of a move,

187
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,540
We'll be switching gears here in just a minute.

188
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,540
Time to open up!

189
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,540
The moon light on my cheeky view,

190
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,540
And I turn the red evil.

191
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,540
Star light on the open road,

192
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,540
And I've made our ever come home.

193
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,540
Now, I don't care just what they're saying,

194
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,540
Because I'm not about to change my ways.

195
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,540
I'm living it up to my day and day.

196
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,540
Star light on the open road,

197
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,540
To total tickets to paradise,

198
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,540
Baby cannot wait,

199
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,540
Oh, we don't have it yet,

200
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,500
Yeah, yeah

201
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,600
Yeah, yeah,

202
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,240
Last totally improved at night.

203
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,240
It it didn't sı me for the light.

204
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,540
It damaged me because I almost tried to hold up

205
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,540
Now I don't care till it's just what they're saying

206
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,540
Because I'm not about to change my ways

207
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:51,540
I'm living it up to you, my dying baby

208
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:57,540
So tell me, tell me, what's wrong with you

209
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,540
Making my baby

210
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,540
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

211
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,460
So tell me, tell me, what's wrong with you

212
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:22,540
Making my baby, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

213
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,980
Muscle cars make me not be between

214
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,580
The line behind me was a 35 foot worthy of all the

215
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,420
He'll imagine the shows are going to be doing from the

216
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,260
road influence by radio stations all across the Great

217
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,420
States of Vietnam Nation. You know someone gave me this fantastic

218
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,140
little device called the Logitech squeeze box and I got to tell you

219
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,860
I've been listening to a lot of country these days and I'm feeling

220
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,660
good about it. I've just came down from Chippewa, had a

221
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,780
station wagon in a hundred dollars, faking about the girl I lost a year

222
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,940
before. I hadn't seen her for some time. Thought I might go on my

223
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,140
when your memory came flooding and you closed that door. Where

224
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,780
she was a free train, baby. Where she was at these

225
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,940
little locomotive. I've come with wisdom down your track.

226
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,940
crashing in your door. Where she was a free train, baby.

227
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,940
Where she didn't have a heart. You need a shovel for the cold.

228
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,940
Just to get me started. Where she was a free train, baby.

229
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,940
Where she was a free train, baby. Where she was a free train.

230
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,940
Will every time I talk to you, I hear your jealous lines.

231
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,940
I feel like I've been left abandoned on some old railway side.

232
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,940
Didn't every time I hear your voice. My water just gets cold.

233
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,940
My stover will not stow. And my water will not always.

234
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,940
It wasn't free train, baby. Where she was at these little locomotive.

235
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,940
I come with wisdom down your track. crashing in your door. Where she

236
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,940
was a free train, baby. Where she didn't have a heart. You need

237
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,940
a shovel for the cold. Just to get me started. Where she

238
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,940
was a free train, baby. Where she was a free train, baby. Where she

239
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,940
was a free train, baby. Where she was a free train, baby.

240
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,940
Will every time I feel behind, I could not get ahead.

241
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,940
I wish someone would hold the lever and give me a little sand.

242
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,940
Didn't every time I slip behind. Even further back,

243
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,940
I wish someone switched man would come out of the fog and change my track.

244
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,940
Where she was a free train, baby. Where she was at these little locomotive.

245
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,940
I come with wisdom down your track. crashing in your door. Where she

246
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,940
was a free train, baby. Where she didn't have a heart.

247
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,940
You need a shovel for the cold. Just to get me started. Where she

248
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,940
was a free train, baby. Where she was a free train, baby. Where she

249
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,940
was a free train, baby. Where she was a free train, baby.

250
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:20,940
Where she was a free train, baby. Where she was at these little locomotive.

251
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,940
I come with wisdom down your track. crashing in your door. Where she

252
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,940
was a free train, baby. Where she didn't have a heart. You need to

253
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,940
shovel for the cold. Just to get me started. Where she

254
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,940
was a free train, baby. Where she was a free train, baby. Where she

255
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,940
was a free train, baby. Where she was a free train, baby. Where she

256
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,940
was a free train, baby. Where she was at this little locomotive. You need to

257
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,940
shovel for the cold. And it's tough for me topaddle. You need to shovel

258
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,940
the camps or the train. You need to shovel for the cold. Surely

259
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:02,940
6 billion dollars,emon brains, and everybody wants to train.

260
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,940
Great train, but if he betrays, after the camp he go, I said.

261
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:56,940
All the board trains good, planes bad.

262
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:03,940
You know the story is for me.

263
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,940
I used to pump my feet and wash it up.

264
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,940
While my jeans do get too heavy and slain here.

265
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,940
While I used to wear around the future.

266
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,940
But then I saw my caution to the wind.

267
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,940
I had no reason to we can't breathe.

268
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,940
I don't know, until I took a trip to the Yellow Sun town.

269
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

270
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,940
You know I heard that book you ran them.

271
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,940
Hey, I have no chance but to give them down down down down down down down down down down down down.

272
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

273
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,940
Another nail fall near to my desk.

274
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,940
All these bad times I'm gone through just this.

275
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

276
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,940

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

278
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,940
I've been a fan of seeing the line name.

279
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,940
I've been as big as heaven soon.

280
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,940
You know I've got to hang out on my head up.

281
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,940
Cause on the belly I feel so hell bad.

282
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,940
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

283
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,940
It's just him, he's the abbreviation that I get.

284
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,940
I know I never ever felt like this before.

285
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,940
I don't know what to do.

286
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,940
I bet they're nuts, nothing new.

287
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,940
Just stop between hell and I want I need that cure.

288
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,940
I make you as a baby.

289
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,940
I'm dancing.

Another nail fall near to my desk.

Of these bad times I'm gone through your stress

309
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,940
Hey, I can't believe in my fears tonight

310
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,940
Baby

311
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,940
F-T-G-R

312
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,940
The music and the top news and baddest

313
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,940
Oh, I love

314
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,940
I wanna left this world

315
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,940
I'm like James, my kids

316
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,940
When the top news and baddest

317
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,940
Oh, I wanna left this world

318
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,940
I wanna left this world

319
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,940
I wanna left this world

320
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,940
I wanna left this world

321
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,940
So I was trying to tell you that

322
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,940
I got an anonymous donation

323
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,940
which is a Logitech squeeze box

324
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,940
Go ahead and Google that you can see exactly what it is

325
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,940
It's basically an internet radio

326
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,940
But it's a tabletop device

327
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,940
And I've been listening to this stream

328
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,940
Pretty much 24-7 in the house

329
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,940
I gotta tell you guys are kicking ass

330
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,940
It's so good

331
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,940
We've got a lot of shows going right now

332
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,940
It's really nice

333
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,940
It sounds like a true open source radio station

334
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,940
It's really, really nice

335
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,940
Of course, we'll keep that going

336
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
As long as we actually can

337
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,940
Because pretty soon you'll need a driver's license

338
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,940
It's actually operate anything on the internet

339
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,940
You saw that tweet, I sent out the other day

340
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,940
YouTube now has a YouTube learning video

341
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,940
We got the message

342
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,940
I heard it on the airways

343
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,940
The politicians

344
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,940
An outdated

345
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,940
And the broadcast was spreading

346
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,940
The station station

347
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,940
That you'll make

348
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,940
Like an action

349
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,940
Because the nation

350
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,940
And the media can't stop

351
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,940
And what if they stop

352
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,940
It's pretty important

353
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,940
Yeah, the way

354
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,940
The politicians are dancing

355
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,940
The politicians are blue

356
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,940
Who will be in good

357
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,940
The politicians are green

358
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,940
The politicians are blue

359
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,940
The distance is not the story

360
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,440
The politics of dance

361
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,940
The politics of blue

362
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,940
Fear could

363
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,940
The politics of millions

364
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,940
중요ously

365
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,940
The distance is not the story

366
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,360
We've gone the crush U.S.,

367
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,240
A history to count our economy,

368
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,140
Who's that a chただ who's the rage

369
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,380

370
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,140

Hey, hey, can't say the name by

372
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,340
My science is even yours

373
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:31,920
Oh, I'll let you have a good one

374
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,940
You can't stop it, hopefully stop the way

375
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,940
You gotta be careful when you

376
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,940
Come on, take some dancing

377
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,940

00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,940
Come on, let's take some women

406
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:01,640
And one of those interesting evenings yesterday.

407
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,340
So Afra was driving around with a top-down blasting out the stream with a rhino.

408
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:12,540
I'm going to pump, actually, to do the show.

409
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:16,940
We're supposed to have a couple of guests over the last night, two people.

410
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,100
And now we're going to do a little barbecue thing, and everything all set up, and all

411
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,860
beautiful, and Miss Mickey had the table set up, and I was all right, and then they

412
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,860
cancelled.

413
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:28,780
And we did one of those things where, you know, we both make some phone calls.

414
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,060
So I called my daughter.

415
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,860
I said, hey, why don't you and Shelby come on over for her friend?

416
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,460
When you guys come on over and hang out, and Mickey was calling some people.

417
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,660
All of a sudden, like, my daughter or girlfriend, three other people show up.

418
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,660
And now I also know I was like cooking for a whole party.

419
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,460
It was like, whoa, a lot of fun though.

420
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,060
And so that also kind of got me into party mood.

421
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:53,460
By the way, I've reset my grow preferences on all of the drop boxes that I'm sharing.

422
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,460
So they stay on screen.

423
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:59,460
So if you drop something in your share in a box with me, it's going to show up on screen.

424
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,460
So I don't have to go hunting around.

425
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:05,460
Because drop box doesn't work very well with a lower level folder.

426
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,260
So it doesn't pop that to the top of the stack in one of those finder windows.

427
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,860
So I just have, uh, just have them all on screen, and I'll select stuff.

428
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,660
So I would love to see what your choices are for today's snafu Saturday.

429
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,260
It is the 16th of April 2011.

430
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,060
This daily source code, 862.

431
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,060
A top of the hour, I'm going to go home.

432
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,060
And then it's got a curry.

433
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,060
And morning.

434
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,260
I'm going to hang my hat.

435
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,460
I'm going to take off my clothes and you're not going to stop me.

436
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,460
I'm off the suit.

437
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,460
My stage.

438
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,460
It's time to rehearse.

439
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,460
I'm going to see all the one who's in the universe.

440
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,260
Pack my bags and now I'm my horse.

441
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,260
And go and ride.

442
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,260
I'm going to the next set of the stars.

443
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,260
But no, no, no, no, no.

444
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,260
Absolutely, nothing, we know man.

445
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,260
But to pay for anything.

446
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,260
We got no shame nobody.

447
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
No, it's my name.

448
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260
I'm going ride.

449
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,260
I'm going to the next set of the next stars.

450
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,260
It goes real good.

451
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,260
And hang my hat.

452
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:36,260
I'm going to the next set of the stars.

453
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,260
It's such a beautiful day.

454
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,260
It's such a beautiful day.

455
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,260
I think I wear my brand new necktie.

456
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,260
I have to take off my arms every time.

457
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,260
Just speak to my ex.

458
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,260
The answer.

459
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,260
I'm going to hop the hood.

460
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,260
I'm going to sit below.

461
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,260
I know where to hide.

462
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,260
Go where to run.

463
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,260
I'm going to loom.

464
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,260
And come to get my dinner wash.

465
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,260
I'm not going to pack my rain.

466
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,260
So now I'm my horse.

467
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
And go and ride.

468
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,260
I'm going to the next set of the stars.

469
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,260
So no, no, no, no.

470
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,260
Absolutely nothing, doesn't ring.

471
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,260
No, it's very cheap in the wind.

472
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,260
And got no shame nobody.

473
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,260
No, it's my name.

474
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,260
And ride.

475
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,260
All over the next set of the stars.

476
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,260
It's found.

477
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,260
And I'm going to the next set of the stars.

478
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:22,260
We will live with a song

479
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,260
I give my life to people

480
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:38,260
I give my life just to people

481
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:43,260
I give my life just to people

482
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,260
I give my life just to people

483
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:53,260
I give my life just to people

484
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,260
Don't use the way I'm gonna break it down

485
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,260
Speak my mind at any time

486
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,260
I got the message playing

487
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,260
Power my soul is strength in my hand

488
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,260
I'm going up north to claim my land

489
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,260
Not to the virus, I might make mistakes

490
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,260
Look out and hide your fans

491
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,260
I'm a woman on top of the huge size

492
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,260
If we as good as any man

00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,260

So no, my money on it

497
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,260
Absolutely, I have to be no man

498
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,260
To pay for anything

499
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,260
We've got no shame about it

500
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,260
Those my name are gonna ride on

501
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,260

00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,260
Oh no

505
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,260
We'll see you in the end

506
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,260
With a song

507
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
Oh yeah

508
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
That's another one of those driving songs

509
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,260
No one's saying

510
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,260
I think who is out on the lawnmower today

511
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,260
Was it right on the bearded?

512
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,260
No one's out there mowing the lawn

513
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,260
You can go for hours listening to shit like this

514
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,260
Man, I love that

515
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,260

Adam Curry

519
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,260
The second best thing you can do by yourself

520
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,260
In the morning

521
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,260
Come on baby

522
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,260
We've been out

523
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,260
We're gonna make you feel

524
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:41,260
Like you were the only one I'm in

525
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,260
Yeah

526
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,260
Soon I'll give you another ever thing

527
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,260
That a woman passed up the king

528
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,260
And I know I did

529
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,260
And each time I tell myself

530
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,260
When I'm just head and on

531
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,260
But I'm gonna show you a baby

532
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,260
That a woman can't return

533
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,260
Was the woman come on

534
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,260
Come on

535
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,260
Come on

536
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,260
Take care

537
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,260
Take her down

538
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,260
Don't let them see

539
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,260
Come on

540
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,260
No baby

541
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,260
Take her down

542
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,260
Don't let them hurt

543
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,260
Not dying yet

544
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,260
Take her down

545
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,260
Don't let them see

546
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,260
Come on

547
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,260
No baby

548
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,260
We all know you got it

549
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,260
If it makes you feel good

550
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,260
Oh we have some deep

551
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:36,260
Oh baby

552
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,260
There's no one I'm in

553
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,260
Straight

554
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,260
Oh no can go on

555
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,260
Honey deep down

556
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,260
Oh I said you know what I'm gonna write

557
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:50,260
Never never never never never hear me

558
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,260
When I cry

559
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,260
I cry

560
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,260
I cry over time

561
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,260
And each time I tell myself

562
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,260
When I can't stand the pain

563
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,260
But when you're made of

564
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,260
I'm staying at once again

565
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,260
I'll see

566
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,260
Come on

567
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,260
Come on

568
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,260
Come on

569
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,260
Take her down

570
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,260
Don't let them see

571
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,260
Come on

572
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,260
Take her down

573
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,260
Take her down

574
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,260
Don't let them hurt

575
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,260
Not dying yet

576
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,260
Oh I have some deep

577
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,260
Oh no baby

We all know you got it

579
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:37,260
If it makes you feel good

580
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,260
Hey

581
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,260
I don't get it

582
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,260
Stop

583
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,260
Yuck

584
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,600

585
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,260

586
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,260
Yuck

587
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,260
Ice

588
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,260
Ice

589
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,260
Who

590
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,260
I don't know

591
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:55,960
Do I

592
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,260
Croquette

593
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,260
Oh

594
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,260
Don't let them see

595
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,260
Come on

596
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,260
Not dying yet

597
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:33,260
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one

598
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:46,640
one, one, two, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one,, one, one, we're not even partial for 100%.

599
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,720
no

600
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,060
I know you've got it to make you feel good

601
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,760
I dragged the Falcon Freedom

602
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,660
all the good guys and Gals are dead aren't they?

603
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,660
happens a lot

604
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,140
NO!

605
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:02,660
NO!

606
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,520
It's new feel, shit baby

607
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:22,020
You know, I'm truly just kind of sufferin' here on the stream really is the only way that music can be saved in today's digital age, you know what I'm saying?

608
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,520
Oh, and then more on its brand new day.

609
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,520
You can't download anything anymore.

610
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,520
You get the three strikes your hour, we'll turn off your red connection.

611
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,520
No, we're just sharing music this way.

612
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,520
See, sure, this is the nicest people to go out and buy stuff.

613
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,520
You know what I'm feeling?

614
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,520
If you're wanna get it, I've been in people coming along with me.

615
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,520
I keep them up, I'm so thankful.

616
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,520
I'm rollin' all boys, they were pleased for me.

617
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,520
I'm gettin' so tired of the cup of tea.

618
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,520
I'm gettin' like a luch from the big white man.

619
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,520
I gotta get away just to cut the knocking.

620
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,520
Tell them I love you, and they live in it so wild and free.

621
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,520
If you wanna get it, I've been in people coming along with me.

622
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,520
I keep them up, I'm so thankful.

623
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,520
I'm close to freedom.

624
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,520
I gotta make a way, gotta make a way, gotta make a way.

625
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

626
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,520
I'm close to freedom.

627
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:45,520
It's another day, it's another day, it's another day.

628
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

629
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,520
I'm close to freedom.

630
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,520
I keep them up, I'm so thankful.

631
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,520
I'm lovin' the world, it's the same I'll be.

632
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,520
I've been in people coming along with me.

633
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,520
I keep them up, I'm so thankful.

634
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,520
I'm lovin' the world, it's the same I'll be.

635
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,520
I keep them up, I'm lovin' the world, it's the same.

636
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,520
Tell them I love you, and they live in it so wild and free.

637
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,520
If you wanna get it, I've been in people coming along with me.

638
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,520
I keep them up, I'm so thankful.

639
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,520
I keep them up, I'm so thankful.

640
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,520
I keep them up, I'm so thankful.

641
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,520
I keep them up, I'm so thankful.

642
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
I keep them up, I'm so thankful.

643
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,520
Gotta tell you though, my fellow chuckle is, I have failed once again.

644
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,520
Last night, excluding my daughter and her friend,

645
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,520
I had to go through hot shakes over at the top watch tower, pack pot commands in it.

646
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,520
I kept them up, I'm so thankful.

647
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,520
Just didn't work.

648
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,520
Hop in.

649
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,520
Of course, the wind and picked up a little bit.

650
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
You know, I got my iPhone always handy, ready to treat that,

651
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,520
because it will have to lie this way.

652
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,520
I have a whole bevy full of babies, filmin' as hot dumplings and ring it out.

653
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,520
Hey, drop me some tunes, everybody. The drop box.

654
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,520
I'll catch her and play them for y'all.

655
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,520
Hey, group, everything's different.

656
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,520
You can fight the sleep, but not the dream.

657
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,520
Things ain't cooking, my kitchen.

658
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,520
Stage friction, wash your knee.

659
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,520
To a season, a moment and fire.

660
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:09,520
Couldn't conquer the blue sky.

661
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,520
There's a small boat made of China.

662
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,520
It's going nowhere on a mental peace.

663
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,520
We'll do a lie like a lounge room, listen.

664
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,520
We'll do a saying like a bug release.

665
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,520
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you.

666
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,520
Everywhere you go, always take the weather.

667
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,520
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you.

668
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:00,520
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you.

669
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:19,520
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you.

670
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,520
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you.

671
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,520
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you.

672
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,520
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you.

673
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,520
Everywhere you go, always take the weather.

674
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:45,520
You take the weather with you.

675
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:12,520
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you.

676
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,520
Everywhere you go, always take the weather.

677
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,520
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you.

678
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,520
Everywhere you go, always take the weather.

679
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,520
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you.

680
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,520
You always like those guys, crowded house.

681
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,520
Everywhere you go, always take the weather.

682
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,520
Don't you know that's the truth.

683
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,520
This is a daily source code episode 862.

684
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,520
I need your arms around me. I need to fill your touch.

685
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,520
I need your understanding, I need your love, love, love, love, love

686
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,520
So much

687
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:11,520
You tell me that you love me so, you tell me that you care about when I need you

688
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,520
Baby, baby, you're never there

689
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,520
On the phone, long, long distance

690
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,520
Always through such strong resistance

691
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,520
On the first you say, you're too busy

692
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:32,520
I wonder if you even miss me never there

693
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,520
Be your never there

694
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:41,520
Be your never ever ever ever there

695
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:01,520
A golden bird that flies away

696
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,520
A candle's fickle flame

697
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,520
To think I held you yesterday

698
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,520
Your love was just a game

699
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,520
A golden bird that flies away

700
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,520
A candle's fickle flame

701
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,520
To think I held you yesterday

702
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,520
Your love was just a game

703
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,520
You tell me that you love me so

704
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,520
You tell me that you care about when I need you

705
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,520
Baby, baby

706
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:26,520
You take the time to get to know me

707
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,520
If you want me why I can't you just show me where

708
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,520
Always on this roller coaster

709
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,520
If you want me why I can't you get closer

710
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,520
Never there

711
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:50,520
Be your never ever ever ever ever never ever

712
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:55,520
Never there

713
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,520
Be your never ever ever ever ever

714
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,520
You know one of the best things about doing radio

715
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,520
We do it these days with our chat room

716
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,520
And no agenda chat.net, no agenda stream.com

717
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,520
We've got this rating system where you can like a song

718
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,520
With a plus five or minus five to scale essentially

719
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,520
Marcus couch in the morning to you just checked in

720
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,520
And rated cake here with a minus five

721
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,520
Yeah, okay. Well, you know what?

722
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,520
You got to drop something in your box Marcus

723
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,520
I mean, you know, it'll show up automatically on the screen

724
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,520
We can drop it in

725
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,520
Silicon spin has the right idea

726
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,520
You're kind of bad pulling stuff out of the show folder

727
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,520
But this is a good one

728
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,520
Do you hear me?

729
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,520
Do you care?

730
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,520
Do you hear me?

731
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,520
Do you care?

732
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,520
Do you care?

733
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,520
Do you hear me?

734
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,520
Do you hear me?

735
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,520
Do you hear me?

736
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,520
Do you hear me?

737
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,520
Do you hear me?

738
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,520
Do you hear me?

739
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,520
Do you hear me?

740
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,520
Do you hear me?

741
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,520
Or do I...

742
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:22,840
When no one listens anymore, when no one listens

743
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,340
What a world's world, when no one listens

744
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,520
I have the snow, you don't need a load

745
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,520
I might as well go up and down to war

746
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,520
Who's all the world's I have, I know I'm back and home

747
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,520
The one thing, am I all alone?

748
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:49,520
The one thing, I don't need a load

749
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,520
You're looking at the path that's been changed

750
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,520
The direction of the world, you're looking at the wrong, it's me

751
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,520
I think you're my president

752
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,520
What a world's world, when no one listens anymore

753
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,520
When no one listens anymore, when no one listens

754
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,520
What a world's world, when no one listens

755
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,520
It's like you stop me at home

756
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,520
Don't you hear me?

757
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,520
Do you care?

758
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,520
Do you hear me?

759
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,520
Do you care?

760
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,520
Don't you hear me?

761
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,520
Don't you hear me?

762
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,520
Don't you hear me?

763
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,520
Just what are you doing?

764
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,520
Do you see me?

765
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,520
Do you see me?

766
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,520
Do you hear me?

767
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,520
Do you hear me?

768
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,360
Do you hear me?

769
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,600
Come, baby!

770
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:40,520
The apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple,

771
00:51:40,520 --> 00:52:10,520
apples, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple

772
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:17,520
I really wish some of my own radio buddies from back in the air.

773
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,520
It was a little mainstream day, it could see my panel right now.

774
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,520
They would freak out if they saw how cool this was.

775
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:30,520
I mean, we used to have like a phone-up sitting in the back, taking requests and then bringing in pieces of paper.

776
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:35,520
And of course, that eventually became a computerized, but it's nothing like this, man.

777
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:41,520
It shows up on my screen, I don't only does the song show up on the screen, but actually it's right there in my draw box.

778
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,520
And I can play it right off the bat as fantastic.

779
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,520
And you guys are in a funky mood today, that's for sure.

780
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:50,520
I had forgotten all about this next song.

781
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:54,520
Probably because, with the first time I heard that I was really fucking drunk.

782
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,520
Oh!

783
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,520
Oh!

784
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,520
I know I've drunk.

785
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:05,520
Ladies and gentlemen, I've forgotten about favorite commands over that.

786
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,520
Is that miss?

787
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,520
Mr. Davoelaena, Mr. Bob Davoelaena.

788
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,520
Mr. Davoelaena, Mr. Bob Davoelaena.

789
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,520
Mr. Davoelaena, Mr. Bob Davoena.

790
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,600
Mr. Davoelaena, Mr.

791
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,520
Oh!

792
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,560
Mr. Davoelaena.

793
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,520
Mr. Davoelaena, Mr. Bob Davoelaena.

794
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,520
Mr. Bob Davoelaena, Mr. Bob Davoelaena.

795
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,520
You really make me sing with your fraudulent behavior

796
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,520
You wanna make me living in a homie good to save you

797
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,520
I don't know to the hand your little rug rat

798
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,520
Take a little tip from the tabloid

799
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,520
Because I know I'm not paranoid

800
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,520
When I say I thought you're trying to mock me

801
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,520
And you and your cool on a mission trying to huff me

802
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,520
But it isn't happening your fraudulent clothes

803
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,520
He used to front big time now I suppose

804
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,520
Then everything's good since the sky level fair

805
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,520
You adapt it to use to make fun of

806
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,520
But now you wanna rock it

807
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,520
Don't you gotta keep it with the homie

808
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,520
But the yellow is already hit to your crown

809
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,520
You can't see your feet, it's not a toughness

810
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,520
Then never have you seen a mother who was someone like

811
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,520
This is the Mr. Dablin' man

812
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,520
Oh my god, you can't get it

813
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,520

00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,520
Oh my god, you can't get it

Teach where to put me on a stop with any smooth

827
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,520
Where's gonna be fraudulent just to wait and see

828
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,520
Where's he with my money grit and then he stole my honey

829
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,520
Mr. Dablin' man

830
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,520
Oh my god, you can't get it

00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,520

00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,520

00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,520
Oh my god, you can't get it

868
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,520
Oh my god, you can't get it

869
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,520
Oh my god, you can't get shit

870
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,520
Oh my god, you can't get it

871
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,520
Oh my god, you can't get it

872

Oh my god, you can't get it

878
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,520
Oh my god, you can't get it

879
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,520
Oh my god, you can't get it

880
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,520
Oh my god, you can't get it

881
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,520
Oh my god, you can't get it

882
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,520
Oh my god, you can't getivity

883
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,520
Oh my god, you can't get shit

884
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,520
Oh my god, you can't get it

885
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,520
Oh my god, you can't get it

886
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,520
Oh my god, you can't get it

887
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,520
Oh my god, you can't get it

888
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:39,520
So I'm thinking we're probably half in there is right now probably drop that track into a show folder and show it up on my panel here. I'm like, oh, that's a cool song. I didn't even realize so I'm on there right?

889
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:47,520
I will be careful not to close stuff out of your drop box. Otherwise before you know it, the whole show would be over.

890
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,520
Just a double eat and miss the bottom double eat up.

891
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:58,520
In fact, right now, play that again this afternoon, man. That song kicks ass and I love that.

892
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,520
Oh, totally awesome, man.

893
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,520
As I said, you guys are in kind of like a real funky movie.

894
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,520
So we'll just play as it comes in.

895
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:17,520
It's probably the only song that Real Smith did that I actually thought was really, really, really, really good.

896
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,520
By the way, the place to drop stuff is the open source daily source code free style box.

897
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,520
I'll find that if you drop it in there, you can always get an invite from someone in the chat room.

898
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:32,520
Here it is. It's a cool, slightly transformed. Just a bit of a break from a norm.

899
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:38,520
Just a little slot in the break of a not neat of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be a little bit out of control.

900
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:42,520
It's cool to dance, but what about a cool, the suits and moves romance.

901
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:47,520
Give me your soft subtle mix. Then if it ain't broken, don't try to fix it.

902
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,520
And think of the summer's other past, adjust the face and let the alpine blast.

903
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:58,520
Poppin my CD and let me run around and put your car on truth and lay back, because it's summer time.

948
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:40,520
There's an air of love and happiness and this is the fresh branches new definition of some of that.

949
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,520
So madness.

950
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:50,520
So I'm just following along with a chat room and no dinner chat doesn't have no agenda streamed.com.

951
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,520
It's all one and the same.

952
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:57,520
People asking me for tips on how to do their shows or future shows as it were.

953
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,520
Of course, anyone can do a show on another screen.

954
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:06,520
I got to set Silicon spin up. He hasn't. I don't think maybe I haven't seen an email from me as a good back to me with it.

955
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,520
Were they regular slot for a show?

956
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,520
You know, that's the beauty of this thing. Just be yourself.

957
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:18,520
Now, I know it sounds easy, but just and don't worry about being professional and making mistakes and stuff like that.

958
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:22,520
It doesn't matter. Really, the stream sounds so good.

959
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:29,520
You know, the other night, let's see, we had Rhino, then we had Yellow, then we had Dedenman.

960
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:39,520
I love that guy's show. He's just like, I don't know, he's, I think he inserts the microphone and his butt hole or something, but it's just a Dedenman.

961
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,520
But it sounds incredibly cool.

962
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,520
And then the system kind of mixes all the songs together.

963
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,520
They still need a whole lot of skills.

964
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:50,520
You basically just talk about whatever you want to talk about and drop it in there.

965
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,520
And you know what, it actually is fucking cool people really do like it.

966
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,520
And we can do with more shows.

967
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,520
So, give me a, let me know.

968
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,520
And remember the slogan for Gitmo Nation, everybody?

969
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:06,520
If you see something, say something.

970
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,520
Back by hand.

971
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:54,520
The struggle with your lawyers keeps me alive.

01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,520
I've got the window wide open.

1051
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,520
Because, well, quite honestly,

1052
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:10,520
running the air condition is just way too expensive.

1053
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,520
It's going to be in the 90s today.

1054
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,520
So I'm going to keep the show going, as long as I can still kind of

1055
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:22,540
Hold on to my seat here without sliding off because it's gonna get really really hot today

1056
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:25,940
It's gonna be an outside day trying to keep cool by the pool

1057
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:34,320
Which is also not heated for obvious reasons fucking state of California man. It's just way way way too expensive

1105
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:58,080
doing the earthquake machine. The folder emptied out. I'm not quite sure. So,

This is one song that's been haunting me.

1138
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,000
I've been looking for and I just downwarded off of iTunes.

1139
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,680
Of course, I paid for it obviously. It's still crossing over into the dropbox here.

1140
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,680
So, I'm here to play that hopefully the next two.

1145
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:43,680
Maybe he got us to get to know the birds along the way.

1146
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:52,680
What if the artist ran the TV?

1147
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:56,680
All he had to meet with friends got to risk care.

1148
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:06,680
Once that it can't have that, the whole symbol of the way.

1149
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:31,680
All he had to meet with friends got to risk care.

1161
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:31,680
I could've made it, I could've made it, I could've made the artist get to know a person all the way

1162
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:41,680
And Bury, fuck all of you, we're here to rock

1175
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:00,680
Just give it up, go on and take it out

1176
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:04,680
You gotta shake it out, baby, to me, yeah

1177
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:06,680
Come on, baby, now

1178
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:11,680
Gonna get what I wanted, let's what I think

1179
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:15,680
Yeah

1180
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:31,680
Going to have a kiss

1181
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:37,680
Going to rock out, for the test

1182
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:42,680
And let me take you on vacation

1183
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,680
Just do it, you'll have that

1184
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,680
Don't take me on

1185
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:55,680
You gotta shake me off baby for me

1186
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,680
Come on and bring me on

1187
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:02,680
Gonna get a what I want and I want to see

1188
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,680
Take it off, take it off

1189
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,680
Take it off baby for me

1190
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:11,680
Take it off baby for me

1191
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:13,680
Take it off baby for me

1192
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:15,680
Woohoo

1193
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,680
Yeah, the Donna's alright

1194
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,680
Marcus couches Dropbox reactivated

1195
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,680
I like it, that's the kind of sound

1196
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:23,680
I like my ears to bleed too

1197
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,680
Okay, what you gotta do now is you gotta

1198
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,680
You gotta turn up your speakers here

1199
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,680
This is really important otherwise you're on here

1200
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:30,680
It's a really soft piece here

1201
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,680
Like really, really crank it up right now

1202
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:33,680
Right now

1203
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,680
Now come on down

1204
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:37,680
Woohoo

1205
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:41,680
Hold down your speakers

1206
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:54,680
Watch the colors wrong with you work

1207
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,680
You lost your mind

1208
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,680
You know we never go out this lane

1209
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,680
You're making me look stupid

1210
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:05,680
Now I'm feeling mad

1211
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,680
It must have been something you ate

1212
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,680
I used to love you

1213
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,680
But now I'm not so sure

1214
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:18,680
There's something about your whole light at two

1215
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:21,680
I've got this feeling

1216
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,680
It has straight through my brain

1217
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:27,680
All you ever think about is food

1218
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:33,680
But you're still my best

1219
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,680
You're still my best

1220
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:55,680
Every time we go out for walking the park

1221
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:59,680
You're always barking up the wrong tree

1222
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,680
Now you just want attention

1223
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:04,680
From the opposite sex

1224
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:08,680
I know the Georgia's using me

1225
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:11,680
Using me sometimes when you get angry

1226
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,680
You show me your teeth

1227
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:17,680
But I know your bark is worse than your bite

1228
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:21,680
When then when you get hungry

1229
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,680
It's a whole different deal

1230
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,680
You act like everything is alright

1231
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:30,680
But you're still my best

1232
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,680
You're still my best

1233
01:24:53,680 --> 01:25:07,680
Every time you try to make me lose in your leash

1234
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,680
You know I'll have to punish

1235
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:14,680
But I know a trick or two

1236
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:20,680
For every time you try to make me lose in your leash

1237
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:24,680
You know I'll have to punish you

1238
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:30,680
You look at me and prove yourself from my feet

1239
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:34,680
Hoping I'm a patchy on the back

1240
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,680
But I'm not gonna go there

1241
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,680
I won't fall for that

1242
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:43,680
Not until you cut me some slack

1243
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,680
But you're still my best

1244
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,680
But you're still my best

1245
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:57,680
You'll feel my feet

1246
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,680
Yeah, that works for me

1247
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:07,680
But you're still my dog

1248
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,680
Nothing like a little bit of cloth

1249
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,680
finger on the daily source code

1250
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:13,680
Bitch here on episode 862

1251
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:16,680
H-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h

1252
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,680
What say ye?

1253
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:22,680
Shall we keep it loud just for a little bit longer?

1254
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,680
I think we got too bad

1255
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,680
Because there's a pandemic on around the abomination

1256
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:32,680
NCT!

1257
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:46,680
When the forest isn't burning right

1258
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,680
Here it's what I like to amen

1259
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:52,680
Last the plains bursting at the midnight

1260
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:57,180
We burn in your bloodstained

1261
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,680
Like a blazing

1262
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:07,680
Underneath the street lights

1263
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:10,680
Everything is live in life

1264
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,680
Then you'll see it

1265
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,680
Dreaming like the egg dust

1266
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,680
Was made of ice

1267
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:20,680
But we'll find a option

1268
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:23,680
And then it just came

1269
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,680
We'll find a option

1270
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:29,680
So let's take a break

1271
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,680
Yeah, it's a back of it

1272
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,680
It's a never-decease

1273
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,680
We'll find a option

1274
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,680
We'll find a option

1275
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,680
We'll find a option

1276
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,680
A never-decease

1277
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,680
A never-decease

1278
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,680
We'll find a option

1279
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,680
We'll find a option

1280
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:59,680
We'll find a option

1281
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,680
Dreaming like the egg, just like the egg

1282
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,680
D fill the glass

1283
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:15,680
Your body is like water

1284
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:17,680
And your body is alive

1285
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:18,680
We'll find a option

1286
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:19,680
I'll show more of the way

1287
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:21,680
I'll show more of the way

1288
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,680
I'll show more of it

1289
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,680
Climbing like trash

1290
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:28,680
That's the end

1291
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:37,680
All in the crossbar

1292
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:40,680
All around the world

1293
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:44,680
There's no way to stop it now

1294
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:48,680
All in the pain damage

1295
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:52,680
It's a never disease

1296
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:56,680
And you're the fact that you're a tribe

1297
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:59,680
Spoken up to your head when you're alive

1298
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:01,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1299
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,680
And you're the...

1300
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1301
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:13,680
No, no, no, no, no

1302
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:18,680
And you're the...

1303
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:21,680
And you're the...

1304
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:29,680
Yeah, yeah...

1305
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:34,680
You're...

1306
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:07,680
Don't get your speakers!

1307
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,680
And you bullshit!

1308
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:31,680
No service for you!

1309
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:40,680
No service for you!

1310
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:44,680
And you bullshit!

1311
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:48,680
But now it's a never disease!

1312
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:54,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1313
01:30:54,680 --> 01:31:00,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1314
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:00,860
I

1315
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:14,640
Bring it into this move, you can take that to the back

1316
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:29,520
Marcas

1317
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:33,820
except hand them in here on the stream nor gym stream.com.

1318
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:37,960
No, you're the chat thought and that daily source code, eight, six, two.

1319
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,960
Playing all the tunes from all around Gitmonation.

1320
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:44,120
I just realized something and that's so good, actually.

1321
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:47,720
And I have to apologize profusely to Gitmoslave.

1322
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:51,520
We have so many shows now on the stream that I just like hop on.

1323
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,120
Like, oh, I'll just do a show right now.

1324
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,280
You know, I just turn out the automation.

1325
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:58,440
Gitmoslave show normally scheduled to start at 10 a.m.

1326
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:02,680
Gitmonation, Westtime, I'm so sorry, man.

1327
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:07,080
The snap-oos Saturday pre-empted your show.

1328
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:14,480
So I will end on time and I will allow for plenty of time for your show, probably around

1329
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:15,480
noon.

1330
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:19,720
When we did that, when we start Gitmoslave show, 12 o'clock, so two hours later than normal.

1331
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,320
And let me just hold on a second.

1332
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:25,800
I need to grab this.

1333
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,800
I need to grab this.

1334
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:52,800
I need to grab this.

1335
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,800
I need to grab this.

1336
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:54,800
I need to grab this.

1337
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:55,800
I need to grab this.

1338
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:56,800
I need to grab this.

1339
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:57,800
I need to grab this.

1340
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:58,800
I need to grab this.

1341
01:32:58,800 --> 01:32:59,800
I need to grab this.

1342
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:00,800
I need to grab this.

1343
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,800
I need to grab this.

1344
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:02,800
I need to grab this.

1345
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,800
I need to grab this.

1346
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:05,800
I need to grab this.

1347
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:06,800
I need to grab this.

1348
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:07,800
I need to grab this.

1349
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:08,800
I need to grab this.

1350
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:09,800
I need to grab this.

1351
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:10,800
I need to grab this.

1352
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:11,800
I need to grab this.

1353
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:12,800

I can't see, the best part of my whole adventure

1373
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,600

1375
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:11,600

01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,600
And I don't miss anything

1377
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:18,600
And I don't miss anything

1378
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:49,600
And I don't miss anything

1379
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,600

Oh yeah.

1386
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:30,600
We're going to drop this.

1387
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:31,600
Thank you.

1388
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,600
That's awesome.

1389
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,600
What the heck is that?

1390
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,600
Trying to start.

1391
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:37,600
Come on, come on.

1392
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:38,600
Come on.

1393
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:39,600
Come on.

1394
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,600
Come on.

1395
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:41,600

01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:43,600
Come on.

1398
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,600
Come on.

1399
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:45,600
Come on.

1400
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,600
Come on.

1401
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:54,600
Come on.

1402
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:55,600
Come on.

1403
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,600
Run, run.

1404
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,600
Run.

1405
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,600
Run.

1406
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:01,600
Run.

1407
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:02,600
Run.

1408
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,600
Run, run, run.

1409
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,600
Come on.

1410
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:05,600
Run.

1411
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:06,600
We're going to drop this.

1412
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:08,600
Come on.

1413
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:09,600
Run.

1414
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:10,600
Run.

1415
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:11,600
We can't do anything.

1416
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,600
We can't do anything.

1417
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:13,600
We can't do anything.

1418
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:14,600
We can't do anything.

1419
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,600
We can't do anything.

1420
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:17,600
Oh, don't you run.

1421
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,600
I didn't supposed to be my taxes back on your Dettysore scodo.

1422
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,600
No.

1423
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:21,600
What is it?

1424
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,600
Eight, six, two.

1425
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:24,600
Here on the Charlie Hillel Chuckle Hands are on Get my Nation.

1426
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,600
Are you all happy and distract the slaves?

1427
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,600
That's good.

1428
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:33,560
As we got the music for here, John Parker from Down that's not your naughty outfit for today.

1429
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:39,360
Oh, you stuck in, and I was moving,

1430
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:45,760
Nets and so, and I couldn't even do it all again,

1431
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:51,160
and it's far gone, down till there,

1432
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:54,560
I don't wanna be again like that,

1433
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:59,560
You want to see a woman cry,

1434
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,560
If you don't wanna be again like that,

1435
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:06,760
if it's getting with me the first time that you threw it.

1436
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:10,460
Oh, you ain't to blend,

1437
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:13,460
know it what I've been wanting to know,

1438
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:16,560
Let's just see us, though,

1439
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:20,660
Take it easy,

1440
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:23,960
I'm squeezing, oh, and know it's not it,

1441
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:27,560
I'm wanting to know it what I've been wanting to get,

1442
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:33,560
Baby life, baby I miss me

1443
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:37,560
Take me to the bone

1444
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:39,560
Life is saddened

1445
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:41,560
Breathe against me

1446
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:43,560
Should we come?

1447
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:45,560
Should we grow?

1448
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:47,560
Just tell me

1449
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:51,560
What the world are you gonna lie about?

1450
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:53,560
You want to see a grown man cry?

1451
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:57,560
You don't want to be a girl

1452
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:59,560
You'll be a girl like that

1453
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:02,560
If this could be the first time

1454
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:09,560
No, it's not it

1455
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,560
You don't hold it

1456
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:13,560
Except, except, except, except, it's me

1457
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:17,560
Take it easy

1458
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:19,560
For them, squeeze me

1459
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,560
No, they'll lie

1460
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:25,560
If you let them, they'll lie

1461
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:27,560
If they do not, they'll lie

1462
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:29,560
If you let them, they'll lie

1463
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,560
Just tell me

1464
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:35,560
What the world are you gonna lie

1465
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:39,560
It's all the night, night and night, it's got a...

1466
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:58,560
You don't wanna be a girl like that

1467
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:01,560
Maybe this is the first time

1468
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:04,560
The first time

1469
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,560
Not in our way, you know it

1470
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:15,560
Just a piece of it

1471
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:20,560
I've been easy, I've been seasoned

1472
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:24,560
Not in our way, not in our way

1473
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:28,560
Not in our way, you know it

1474
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,560
I am in the same car for him.

1475
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,560
I'm not into your baby.

1476
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:35,560
I'm just thinking about notting on it.

1477
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:38,560
I'm running out of the car.

1478
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:39,560
I'm notting on it.

1479
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:41,560
God's words, notting on it.

1480
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:44,560
I think it was John Puy.

1481
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,560
I think he was on a show at the same time as this next guy.

1482
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:50,560
It's kind of like a serendipity here on the street.

1483
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,560
Yeah, it was a rough line.

1484
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,560
Here's the black helicopter's coming over.

1485
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:57,560
I haven't heard this song in 25 years.

1486
01:40:57,560 --> 01:41:04,560
One of the guy was still like guy and not some douchebag on celebrity apprentice.

1487
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,560
Really douchebag.

1488
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:07,560
Hey, hello.

1489
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,560
If it ain't broke, break it.

1490
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,560
You know you can.

1491
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:32,560
Oh, I don't know where I am, but I'll slow.

1492
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:33,560
Oh, where did I go?

1493
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:37,560
There's nothing I've ever dreamed of.

1494
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:40,560
As if going up a hill to black.

1495
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:44,560
Oh, I don't know where I am, but I'll slow.

1496
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,560
Oh, where did I go?

1497
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:48,560
I'll get it back.

1498
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:53,560
I'm a just and lonely child, and I don't ever know.

1499
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:58,560
Oh, where did I go?

1500
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:03,560
I'm a just and lonely child, and I don't ever know.

1501
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:06,560
Oh, where did I go?

1502
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:09,560
I don't know where I am, but I'll slow.

1503
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:10,560
Oh, where did I go?

1504
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:16,560
I don't know where I am, but I'll slow.

1505
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,560
Oh, where did I go?

1506
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:22,560
We get it in it broke, break it!

1507
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:34,560
Give my soul a back in the air, man

1508
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:36,560
Give my soul a back in the air, man

1509
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:37,560
Give my soul a back in the air, man

1510
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:40,560
Give my soul a back in the air, man

1511
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,560
Give my soul a back in the air, man

1512
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:43,560
Give my soul a back in the air, man

1513
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:44,560
Give my soul a back in the air, man

1514
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,560
Give my soul a back in the air, man

1515
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:47,560
Give my soul a back in the air, man

1516
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:48,560
Give my soul a back in the air, man

1517
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:49,560
Give a soul a back in the air, man

1518
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:53,560
Give my soul a back in the air, man

01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:09,560
Where's that needle all wrong?

1547
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:12,560
I'm not talking about the needle open that stupid insurance commercial

1548
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,560
or the needle open celebrity apprentice.

1549
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,560
I'm talking about this one of them.

1550
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,560
That was the shit, man.

01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,560
That's kicks in major ass.

1555
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:28,560
If I ain't hurt by it, I'm breakin' you know you can.

1556
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:30,560
You know I am such a douche.

1557
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:31,560
I'm so stupid.

1558
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:33,560
Bobby Eaton's in town today.

1559
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:35,560
We've been a perfect day to have her come by and hang out

1560
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:37,560
of the pool and get them to show them.

1561
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:38,560

I know, rock the road

1610

Rock the cradle

1613
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:05,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:15,560

1621
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:46,060
Oh my gosh, I'm so rude and trained

1622

1624

Shake it up, never at your mouth

1625
01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:00,560
But if I'm alive, I'm all wrong by

1626

And, Gary, fuck all of you, we're here to rock

1645

To wake up like this school

1646

Man, you don't want to go

1647
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:31,560
And give up, please, but you still said no

1648
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:38,560
You missed two classes and no homework

1649
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,560
But you take your breakfast glass

1650
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,560
Life is so kind and jerk

Your heart's going to smoke in many seconds

1654
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:04,560
No way

1656
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:16,560
Man, you live in that home

1657
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,560
It's such an entrance

1658
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:23,560
Now you're my doorway

1659
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:25,560

You should, because you're the only one

1663
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:49,560
You gotta fight

1664
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:52,560
Oh my god, I'm a three

1665
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:55,560
And it's half a monastery

1666
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:02,560
And it's half a monastery

1667
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,560
To fight for your right

1668
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:06,560
To fight for the rest

1669
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:13,560
I can't get out of my home if you don't cut that hair

1670
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:21,560
You're mama sitting in a tent, what's that noise?

1671
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:28,560
Oh mommy, just chill, I sit's good, please stay boys

You gotta fight for you right

1675
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:59,560
You gotta fight for you right

1676
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:25,560
Don't you want to be a person,ality

1677
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:29,560
An ocean in the sea, but you'll never make it

1678
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:32,560
You can't extinguish your domestic interest

1679
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:37,560
I make it and I want you to know you don't have a bar to go

1680
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:41,560
So we'll use all your dough, type a new floor

1681
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:44,060
To see what flows and mighty unnoticed

1682
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:47,560
But those folks tell you how most not your way

1683
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:49,560
To popularity

1684
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,560
And we'll teach you to play

1685
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:54,560
When I see spirit from rock here

1686
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,560
It'd be nicked fables

1687
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:59,560
Take you there, there's nobody else

1688
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:01,560
Like you and they sure can

1689
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:03,560
As much I do, but I don't know

1690
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:06,560
We've got to sacrifice

1691
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:10,560
Hey, yeah, yeah

1692
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:15,560
So don't you wanna be a big time entity

1693
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:17,560
Your place in history

1694
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:20,560
But don't be scared of what we say

1695
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:23,560
Because there's no fear for being your friend

1696
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:25,560
But wait until it's in the hall

1697
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:27,560
We just tracing the call

1698
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:29,560
We'll have to dump you all

1699
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:32,560
But don't you try to pass us back

1700
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:35,560
Because we own you until we're through

1701
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:37,560
And there's no man

1702
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:39,560
Even like you and me

1703
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:40,560
Don't care as much

1704
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,560
I feel like there's no way

1705
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,560
You got ourselves prepared

1706
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:47,560
But hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

1707
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:50,560
Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey

1708
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:53,560
Oh, yeah, why me a pony, bitch

1709
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:55,560
Honey is me a pony

1710
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:56,560
That spider bait

1711
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:57,560
On a daily source code

1712
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:58,560
Oh, chuckleheads

1713
01:54:58,560 --> 01:54:59,560
I'm having such a good time

1714
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:02,560
So nice of you to be dropping all these awesome tracks

1715
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:04,560
Coming through the Dropboxes

1716
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:06,560
Oh, wow, oh, man

1717
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:09,560
Oh, I think I need to get to

1718
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:10,560
I need to get agonated

1719
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:12,560
I need some more water here in a moment

1720
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:15,560
Okay, so let's change the mood just a little bit

1721
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:17,560
That was that was quite a spurt

1722
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:19,560
We made there all of us

1723
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:22,560
Okay, so yeah, I told you about this

1724
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:24,560
Squeeze box thing that I've been playing around with

1725
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:25,560
And listening to

1726
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:28,560
Radio stations from all around get monation

1727
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:31,560
And I think it's not a secret that I am

1728
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:34,560
And undercover country

1729
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:36,560
Not at loves me the country and western

1730
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,560
And the weather reasons is

1731
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:40,560
Because I know a lot of the guys who were playing on the songs these days

1732
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:46,560
Because it seems like all the 80s rock guys are now playing in the country and western bands

1733
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,560
Just kind of freely

1734
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:52,560
If I've out watching the country music awards a couple weeks back

1735
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,560
And little is like, oh, there's that guy

1736
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:57,560
Oh, wow, what do we do. I always want to

1737
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:04,000
ahead. And sometimes it's, it's really the track that does it for me. Sometimes it's,

1738
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,800
well, I have to say it's often the lyrics. So I'm going to take you on a completely

1739
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:11,960
different turn here in the daily source code as we often do. This one's a little bit

1740
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:15,400
abrupt though, because we're going from that earbleed and shit to this. And by the

1741
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:22,240
way, it's not shit. That wasn't this, isn't. But the lyrics are so good to this song.

1742
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:29,040
I can't get it out of my head. It's a big hit right now on Country Radio. No, it's

1743
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:34,840
not Taylor Swift nudeling around. That she actually ruins Country Radio. But it's

1744
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:40,000
martinamic bride. And you listen to the lyrics of this song, you think, if you know,

1745
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:46,680
if you got kids, it's right on. It's right on top. So I'm just saying what I think is my

1746
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:52,200
favorite lyric coming up right in the beginning. And if we're being honest, then honestly,

1747
01:56:52,440 --> 01:57:03,960
I think I need a drink. My baby's grown up. She thinks she's falling all in love and

1748
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:05,960
that hate.

1749
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:13,200
It's 17. She just slapped me when I was 17. So I don't blame her.

1750
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:23,200
We're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do

1751
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:53,200
it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna

1752
01:57:53,200 --> 01:58:23,200
do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, oh we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do that, we're gonna do that, we're gonna do that, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna, we're gonna, we won't do that, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do that, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, let, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're' gonna do it, we're gonna do

1753

We did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it,

1755
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:37,640
And never when we used to be, everything made ever need.

1756
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:41,640
We had them believe and we were cool.

1757
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:48,040
It's longer than half an overnight, we're always home now, always right.

1758
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:52,160
We used to be the ones breaking the rules.

1759
01:59:52,240 --> 02:00:00,960
Now we're just lovers, we're just fathers, a teamage star.

1760
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:02,960
Watch both foxes, that's who we are.

1761
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:05,960
Yeah, teamage stars.

1762
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:09,760
I told you that this is some kick-off.

1763
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:10,560
I'm happy.

1764
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:15,360
I'm feeling better, I'm tired, so I'm just saying what I think.

1765
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,160
Oh, yeah, sight marketing.

1766
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:20,400
If we're being honest and honest,

1767
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:23,400
I think I made a dream.

1768
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:28,400
Oh yeah, we're just mothers and fathers of teenage daughters.

1769
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:31,400
Some of us are at least.

1770
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:36,400
Now, if I'm honest, I need a dream.

1771
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:38,400
See you right back.

1772
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:40,400
Don't go anywhere.

1773
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:43,400
More snap food on the way.

1774
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:54,400
Oh, baby's together.

1775
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:57,400
Everyone I see.

1776
02:00:57,400 --> 02:01:01,400
Half of us are satisfied.

1777
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:04,400
Half of us need.

1778
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:08,400
And that's found a fool in us.

1779
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:11,400
Turn it's behind me.

1780
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:18,400
Oh, when will that be a harvest for the world?

1781
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:31,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1782
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:38,400
A nation planted, so concerned with them.

1783
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:45,400
As the seasons come and go, greater grows the pain.

1784
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:52,400
And fall too many, feeling the strain.

1785
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:59,400
Oh, when will that be a harvest for the world?

1786
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:11,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1787
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:41,400
