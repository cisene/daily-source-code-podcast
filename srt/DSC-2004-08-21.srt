The Power of Source Code

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:19,540
Yeah, hi everybody, it's Source Code. It is Saturday, August 21st, 2004. I'm Adam Curry.

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:27,240
Saturday afternoon in Curry Castle in Belgium. It's about 3.36. How's that for an approximate time for you?

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:35,360
Sorry about yesterday. No postings on the blog and no source code. It was just way too crazy.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,760
During the radio show in the morning, as you know, we're winding down.

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,500
One more week to go and then two more days to finish up the month and that'll be all over.

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,920
We had the Chanuk crew who flew us in Iraq.

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:01:03,020
They flew us from Camp Smitty to Basra.

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,620
a final two or three hour drive from there to Kuwait on our way home.

10
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,080
And we also did some night goggle vision reconnaissance flights.

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,300
So anyway, they came by.

12
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,400
They wanted to see where we worked since we'd already seen their area of responsibility.

13
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,300
It was a good time, but tiring nonetheless.

14
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,700
From there, I went straight home.

15
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:29,940
There was someone who almost arrived immediately for an interview, which was, of course, all

16
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,300
set up.

17
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,100
But I keep forgetting I really don't like doing stuff on Friday afternoons.

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,120
And then on top of that, some folks who had seen the house earlier in the week came back,

19
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,920
wanted to see it again.

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,520
This time they brought the entire family.

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,420
And I got a call earlier this morning that they are coming back again on Monday.

22
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,680
So that looks good.

23
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:03,780
I don't know if you remember, two days ago I mentioned that Crystal, my assistant, had...

24
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,760
I'm not quite sure where she got it from.

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:16,460
She got one of these Pinnacle Systems Show Center, which is essentially a video device that you hook up to your television.

26
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,840
I have it hooked up to our big Grandmaster View screen here.

27
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,980
It has a Wi-Fi card, so it talks to your Wi-Fi environment.

28
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:32,860
And it sits there basically listening for a show center server, which I'm not quite sure what protocol it speaks.

29
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,500
It may be Windows Media Server, I'm not sure.

30
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:42,100
But that has to run on a Windows machine, so I still have an old Sony VAIO laptop with Windows 2000.

31
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,840
Loaded it up, and lo and behold, it's working.

32
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,500
First of all, regarding the...

33
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,040
the setup

34
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,420
the wifi setup

35
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,000
is stupid

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,060
you have to fill in

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,420
name, a network name, and it comes with a show center as the network name installed

38
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,280
standard, which makes no sense because, of course, that means everyone's going to have

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,960
to change that.

40
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,760
Either you have to change your Wi-Fi network name or you have to figure out how to change

41
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,280
it on the show center device, which means you've got to reboot, hold down the B key.

42
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,940
I mean, this is all stuff that is just not easy for people.

43
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,740
I think it should work like my laptop does.

44
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,640
When I walk in range of a new Wi-Fi network, it says, hey, should I add this?

45
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,720
Do you want to connect to it now?

46
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,140
That, of course, is the way this should work as well.

47
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,840
So basically, you create a database in the show center software on the PC.

48
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:41,680
Of course, just like a share program, like a peer-to-peer program, if you want, it'll

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,960
go through your entire disk and pull up all kinds of media files.

50
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,360
So that works pretty straightforward.

51
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
And it's basically...

52
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,240
Basically, you have three bins, music, movies, photos.

53
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,960
You can create playlists from them.

54
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,160
is the files that it will accept.

55
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,800
Let me see.

56
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
I think I have...

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,980
Here, it does tell me which files it'll accept.

58
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,760
Hold on.

59
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:23,840
mp3 windows media audio wave file jpeg png gif mpeg1 mpeg2 divx avi version 5 plus 4 plus 5

60
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:33,540
simple profile remember that is x video avi simple profile dv avi windows media video video files

61
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:39,080
also must all contain audio data well so apparently there's a quite a difference between

62
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:46,860
avis and avis because some really i had this huge bucket of bit torrent downloads which

63
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:53,740
are either mpegs or avis and some of the avis do work on the show center if you put it in a

64
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:03,160
windows media video it converts it to a vcd file you know so it's a little bit disappointing that

65
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,700
you just don't know exactly what is going to work or not and if you should convert prior to

66
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,260
putting it into this database

67
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,000
or if it

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,720
will do it by itself. It's very unclear.

69
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,960
Something it does have that's pretty cool is you can

70
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,820
set up a folder to be watched

71
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,860
and the minute you drop

72
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,840
anything into that folder, automatically

73
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,080
it will be added to the database and then

74
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,900
from the control center, the show center

75
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,740
in the living room, which has a remote control,

76
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,920
makes it nice, you can already

77
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,100
a little light pops on saying new media

78
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,820
and you go to the new media menu

79
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,540
it will show up and it will play.

80
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,900
Essentially when you select new media to be played

81
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,560
it's being streamed across

82
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,020
my Wi-Fi network.

83
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,140
So I'm going to play with it a little bit more

84
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,740
and I'm interested to see how

85
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,060
Tricia, my wife, and Christina, our daughter

86
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,060
how they pick it up

87
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,020
and how they use it and I'm putting mounted

88
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,940
volumes on their

89
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,840
computer desktops so they can just

90
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,500
drag and drop stuff in there as well.

91
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,580
So we'll see what happens. It'll be cool.

92
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,880
Right.

93
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,860
I told you that I've been reading

94
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,120
...

95
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,500
That would be big quotation marks.

96
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,740
Michael Crichton's Timeline.

97
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,880
The reason why I say reading

98
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,740
is because I've been listening to it on audiobook.

99
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,260
I actually just finished it yesterday afternoon

100
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,260
on my drive home, sitting in some extra traffic.

101
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,020
So I even was able to finish up

102
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,440
the last 25 minutes I thought

103
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,760
I wouldn't be able to listen to during my drive home.

104
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,060
Great book.

105
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,000
Really enjoyed it.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,260
14 hours worth of audio.

107
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,020
And I got an email from Dave Weiner.

108
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,420
Let me just pick that up here.

109
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,440
FYI, I've become a member of audible.com

110
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,780
and am reading

111
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,520
Timeline now as I drive.

112
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,620
He's driving across country.

113
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,480
It's a very nice, if somewhat paranoid, service.

114
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,880
I guess he's referring to...

115
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,380
He could be referring to the book or to audible.com.

116
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,200
Thanks for the tip in your audio blog post.

117
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,220
Next stop, St. Augustine.

118
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:02,780
Dave.

119
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,220
Okay.

120
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,460
So there's something interesting.

121
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,560
I was talking about the audiobook.

122
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,400
I think what I even said is...

123
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,000
Gee, wouldn't it be cool if I could attach one of those DRM

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,860
protected audio files, because Audible.com uses the AAC, Apple, DRM, can't copy me stuff.

125
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,160
And if you tried to open it in iTunes just by double clicking it, it would then say, hey,

126
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,240
you know, you want to buy this book? Looks like Adam referred it to you. Of course, they have a

127
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:38,340
number, it's DRM, so they know that I bought it. And maybe they could give me two bucks for selling

128
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:44,040
another copy, because I think it goes for, I don't know, it goes for at least $10. What I want to do

129
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,880
today, though, is share with you a little piece from that book, a monologue, which I found very

130
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:59,840
interesting and very applicable to perhaps the reason why we have weblogs today. Now, if you're

131
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,420
reading this book still and don't want to hear any parts of it, then you should probably not listen

132
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:11,900
to this. It's definitely not a spoiler, doesn't mess you up at all about the plot or the outcome

133
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,020
of the book. But it's a monologue by one of my friends, and I'm going to share with you a little

134
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,500
one of the characters and he's basically doing

135
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:24,860
a pitch for this vision that he has, which is irrelevant, but listen to the theory behind

136
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,300
the pitch.

137
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,380
Now, of course, since this is an AAC file, I can't open it in any other application but

138
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:30,840
iTunes.

139
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,080
I tried to open it in QuickTime, didn't work either.

140
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,260
So I can't open it into my recording application, so I'm going to have to put the mic down on

141
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,760
the speaker so that I can start up iTunes and you can listen to this.

142
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,540
This is about three minutes, but it's a very interesting thing.

143
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,040
Hi.

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,560
He walked back and forth across the stage.

145
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,640
Today, everybody expects to be entertained, and they expect to be entertained all the time.

146
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,140
Business meetings must be snappy, with bullet lists and animated graphics, so executives aren't bored.

147
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,240
Malls and stores must be engaging, so they amuse as well as sell us.

148
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,680
Politicians must have pleasing video personalities and tell us only what we want to hear.

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,580
Schools must be careful not to bore young minds that expect the speed and complexity of television.

150
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,320
Students must be amused, everyone must be amused, or they will switch.

151
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,780
Switch brands, switch channels, switch parties, switch loyalties.

152
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:38,360
This is the intellectual reality of Western society at the end of the century.

153
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,960
In other centuries, human beings wanted to be saved, or improved, or freed, or educated.

154
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,560
But in our century, they want to be entertained.

155
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,680
The great fear is not of disease or death, but of boredom.

156
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,440
A sense of time on our hands.

157
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,000
a sense of nothing to do, a sense that we are not amused.

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,800
But where will this mania for entertainment end?

159
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,240
What will people do when they get tired of television, when they get tired of movies?

160
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,180
We already know the answer.

161
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:17,700
They go into participatory activities, sports, theme parks, amusement rides, roller coasters,

162
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,660
structured fun, planned thrills.

163
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,280
And what will they do when they tire of theme parks and planned thrills?

164
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,380
Sooner or later, the artifice becomes too noticeable.

165
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:37,880
They begin to realize that an amusement park is really a kind of jail in which you pay to be an inmate.

166
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,860
This artifice will drive them to seek authenticity.

167
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:47,580
Authenticity will be the buzzword of the 21st century.

168
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,120
And what is authentic?

169
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,600
Anything.

170
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,520
Anything that is not devised and structured to make a profit.

171
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,000
Anything that is not controlled by control.

172
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,760
corporations, anything that exists for its own sake, that assumes its own shape. But of course,

173
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,820
nothing in the modern world is allowed to assume its own shape. The modern world is the corporate

174
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:17,740
equivalent of a formal garden, where everything is planted and arranged for effect, where nothing is

175
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:27,440
untouched, where nothing is authentic. Where, then, will people turn for the rare and desirable

176
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:38,460
experience of authenticity? They will turn to the past. The past is unarguably authentic.

177
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:47,500
The past is a world that already existed before Disney and Murdoch and Nissan and Sony and IBM

178
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:47,720
and Amazon.

179
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:55,000
All the other shapers of the present day. The past was here before they were. The past rose

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,500
and fell without their intrusion and molding and

181
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,640
selling. The past is

182
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,980
real. It's authentic.

183
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,560
And this will

184
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
make the past unbelievably

185
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,180
attractive.

186
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,280
Well, that's

187
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,820
probably about enough of that.

188
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,840
And hopefully it sounded okay through my

189
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,660
air-based audio bridge.

190
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,540
So I thought that was just an

191
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,040
interesting bit of monologue.

192
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,560
One about how people were going to look for

193
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,860
reality. And maybe that's what weblogs

194
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,640
bring if you subscribe to that

195
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,840
type of vision. That weblogs

196
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,520
bring a sense of reality. Or

197
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,720
multiple weblogs can triangulate

198
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,600
reality. And the whole

199
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,160
bit about the past, who knows?

200
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,380
Maybe that's what archives are all about.

201
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,560
So what else?

202
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,680
um...

203
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,040
iPodder update, the application that turns your iPod into an audio MP3 aggregator.

204
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,380
So the current status is you fire it up manually.

205
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,400
It sucks in about six different feeds and updates your iTunes.

206
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,000
And if you have it, an iPod automatically.

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:13,440
I'm going to be working on the next release where there will be a separate text file sitting in the iPodder folder.

208
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,160
And that's going to be your subscription file.

209
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:22,660
So all you do is basically just add a new line with a URL to it to any MP3 enclosure feed with MP3 files.

210
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,320
And it'll automatically run through that file as well.

211
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,320
It'll parse it and download the enclosures when you run the iPodder application.

212
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,840
After that, so that'll probably be about release beta 06,

213
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:45,180
I hope to just have some form of installer that sets it all up for you and runs the program at a set interval.

214
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,100
with one configuration file

215
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,560
And you never hear from it again.

216
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,640
It just keeps running automatically at the intervals that you set.

217
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,740
And I think I mentioned in the previous show

218
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,420
that it looks like some developers out there

219
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,840
are working on their own versions.

220
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,940
Some Python stuff.

221
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,260
I'm looking forward to that coming out.

222
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,100
Please, make this better than I did.

223
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,680
Let's see.

224
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,000
That's about it.

225
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,340
Let me see.

226
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,380
I've been at this for...

227
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:11,940
How long are we going to talk?

228
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,580
14 minutes?

229
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,680
Okay, no song of the day.

230
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,640
Besides, enough copyright violation with that bit from the timeline audiobook.

231
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,880
But I'm going to go fill up the server with some more content.

232
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,320
See if I can now connect the bridge on that

233
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,100
so that if a new video comes in as a torrent,

234
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,080
bit torrent file,

235
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,920
it's downloaded and then automatically dropped into this watch folder

236
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,200
on the Windows PC server

237
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,900
so that we can then watch it in the living room.

238
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,140
Wow.

239
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,900
It's kind of like when I was a kid.

240
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,700
The RadioShack 101 projects.

241
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
Just need to have a red wire, a blue wire,

242
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,620
and a nice long yellow.

243
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,500
one and it'll all work.

244
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,800
Okay, everybody, that's it.

245
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,640
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

246
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:52,960
Bye.

247
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,000
Bye.
