1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:17,820
Hey everybody it's source code for August 19th 2004 I'm out of

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:28,620
today from Korea Castle in Belgium and it's a little bit later than usual. I guess maybe

3
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,720
it's starting to become the norm now. I was late last night as well. It's 10 o'clock

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,280
in the evening and I'm telling you until I get to the end of these radio shows, I'm

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,960
not going to be able to get this source code up on a daily basis before 8 o'clock in the

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,480
morning east coast to US time. Hopefully after that though, we'll be, we'll

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,760
be better on the timing. Okay, just switch a few things around here on my screen. A couple

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:04,880
of things I want to talk about today. First of all, you know I've been winding down my

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,000
year long 10 year of doing the morning show for Radio Veronica here in the Netherlands.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,440
And so, you know, near the end and last week, well, next week we'll have, it'll be our last

11
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,000
week and then there's Monday and Tuesday because actually my last show is on the 31st.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So we've got all kinds of great guest book and today we have

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,180
had the Leofond de Chote, famous disc jockey from Tholm,

14
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,300
30 years ago, he was on the pirate ships,

15
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,980
which were operating on the North Sea.

16
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,860
He ever heard the story behind that, it's great.

17
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,620
Now, I have to look up the history

18
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,780
of the pirate radio broadcast ships,

19
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,100
radio caroline, radio Veronica, radio and what sea

20
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,700
international, it was a crazy time.

21
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,620
And he was one of the pirate disc jockeys

22
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,540
on one of those ships on the international waters

23
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,780
in the North Sea.

24
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,360
And now he is the program director,

25
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,500
or the, yeah, he's the guy that's responsible

26
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,940
for the entire programming on three

27
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,180
of the top commercial television stations.

28
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,180
And it was really, you know, it was very intense

29
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,220
to do a show with, so I've also worked with him.

30
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,780
He directed a live show that I did called Countdown,

31
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,660
which was a new bass show.

32
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,980
We had live guests and we had people performing

33
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,980
and videos and we did that for, you know,

34
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,500
the whole season.

35
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,380
So we worked very intently together

36
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,980
and we've had our ups and downs.

37
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,020
But it's always a really intense,

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,160
concentrate when you're doing it to you with someone like that, maybe a little bit more

39
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,160
than normal.

40
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,740
And I wasn't feeling too hot today.

41
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,340
So I was pretty wiped out after the show.

42
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,180
Had to go up to the flat screen factory that I have a stake in called GrandmasterView.

43
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,500
If you, you know, you should look it up, www.GrandmasterView.com.

44
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,940
It's pretty cool that we have humongous flat screens at unbelievably low prices.

45
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:56,540
So in the, I got home and just slept until like six or six, thirty and had dinner and

46
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,940
now we're just kind of hanging out and about ready to go back to bed.

47
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,380
Such is the life of the morning.

48
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,380
This kajake.

49
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,860
And you can tell I'm a disc jockey because I have all the lore as well.

50
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:14,860
Now about audio blogging, I picked up a pretty cool post yesterday from Harold Gilchrist.

51
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:20,140
And once in a second, let me see what the URL of his website is.

52
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,020
I have to find that and put a link to it.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,120
it because radio.weblogs.com website. But if you just Google it Harold Gilchrist, that's

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:42,800
a G-I-L-C-H-R-I-S-T. And he posted some interesting thoughts in his own audio blog about, well,

55
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,520
what he calls the rise of audio enclosure blogging. Of course, that tickled me and I

56
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,200
can just bring my mixer back to the front here. I'm going to play a little bit, a snippet.

57
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,080
Listen to what he's saying. There's a couple of things in there that I like that he said.

58
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:08,960
Check it out. This is Harold Gilchrist and whereas I call this source code, the daily source code,

59
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:16,160
if you will. Another audio blogging example, which actually I took example who is Dave Weiner's

60
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,200
morning coffee notes. And Harold calls his audio blogs poolside.

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,440
Anyway, but there's a lot of new audio ging.

62
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,900
big out there in a blog as fair. I usually call the blog oddspare. And that's good. That's

63
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,700
good news. So let's back up a second. I said it's the rise of the RSS enclosure audio

64
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:44,660
blogger. And again, this is just something I'll remember, but it seems that if you look

65
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:51,300
at the RSS feeds of Adam and Dave, and I believe now Doug Kay is doing it for Callie,

66
00:04:51,300 --> 00:05:02,780
let these audio posts are accompanied by MP3s in the feeds. And developers like Adam Perry

67
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:09,620
or writing scripts to take advantage of that being there. So follow this as good news. As

68
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:17,140
an observer of audio blogging, this is very healthy. And I look forward to the, did the

69
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:24,740
lip in the audio blogging attention, get greater. And I've been seeing it happen now.

70
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,740
Okay.

71
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,740
That's

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Some nice words there from Harold

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,200
About audio blogging

74
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,280
I don't know what Harold does. I gather from his post maybe he's a consultant or

75
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,840
He said it's his job to pay attention to what's going on in the blogosphere, so

76
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:49,000
Something that one part that I really like there is that he said that developers like Adam Curry. I'm like oh, yes

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,080
Finally I'm starting to graduate into the developer sphere

78
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,920
And I wanted to stop and talk about that for just a second because I've created this thing called iPod

79
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,080
Which more people are using than I then I anticipated

80
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,440
Because now of course I'm getting support questions and all kinds of stuff that comes along with developing something

81
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:17,040
My intention with iPod was to create something that unfortunately I can only do it for the Mac because that's all I have and that's the only thing I know how to

82
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,120
program or develop on or

83
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,560
integrate systems on

84
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,880
Is

85
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,480
That if you subscribe to an RSS feed that has mp3

86
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,220
closures like Harold explained that it will automatically show up on your iPod, really

87
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,540
making your iPod an aggregate.

88
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,500
And the intent behind it was just to prove the concept, show it says what I want it to

89
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:49,620
be, this is how I want it to work and hopefully other people will catch on to it and with a

90
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,820
little bit of luck developers will start to make the same functionality hopefully better

91
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:00,700
in cross-platform development environments.

92
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:08,620
Steve Garfield who is a video blogger, well he caught me on one of the, probably the Achilles

93
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,100
heel of the iPod or application.

94
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,660
Steve said, hey it's funny, I removed all this content, didn't want from the iPod or

95
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,220
folder and it came back magically.

96
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,180
So there it is, I built an application that doesn't really have a database.

97
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,140
So it dollars I guess it parks the file system and uses that as a database.

98
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,080
enclosures are still in the active RSS feed, it's going to want to suck those in.

99
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,200
So if you have something like, see if you have a feed that doesn't update very often,

100
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,960
take IT conversations for instance.

101
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,040
There's probably 15 shows in their feed and one is added every other day or every three

102
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
days.

103
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,720
So if you remove five or six of those files, only one of them or two of them won't come

104
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
back.

105
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,760
On the contrary, this is another observation I had.

106
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,920
If you have something like scripting news and Dave posts an MP3 in his enclosure, if

107
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,480
you don't, if your script isn't running often enough, Dave will out post your aggregator

108
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,640
and that posting will actually drop off the edge of the RSS file and you'll miss it.

109
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,040
So all kinds of things to be considered there when it comes to updating.

110
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:27,160
Of course this is because we're not, we're, we're not using or it's difficult to use

111
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,320
uh, pings effectively because of course

112
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:37,500
what you want is you want to be notified that something's updated and updated accordingly

113
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,940
and not necessarily pull the whole time.

114
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,460
But that's a whole other discussion.

115
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,020
So anyway, check out SteveBarfield.com.

116
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,020
He blogged the Democratic National Convention.

117
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,020
He's really funny.

118
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,740
I like the way he did it and I can see he's learning his video skills very, very quickly.

119
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,980
I think guess he's doing most of it on Final Cut Pro and the iMovie, but it's good stuff.

120
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,980
And once we figure out how we use enclosures with audio, which I think is a lot easier

121
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:09,700
to do, I know is a lot easier to develop for just because of the sheer size of the files,

122
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:16,020
I think we'll be able to apply a lot of this to the video blogging.

123
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,500
Which really, in my mind, if we say blogging in the context of audio or video blogging,

124
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,340
it's audio and video distribution.

125
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:29,800
And BitTorrent is a major part of that and I hope to start testing with that in the audio

126
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,060
realm pretty soon.

127
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,060
Um

128
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,600
Okay, hope you can still stand this sound of the crappy microphone.

129
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:44,280
Luckily, when I turn the mic off, it doesn't crap out, and I'm going to do so with a song.

130
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:52,360
And I've been thinking, I don't really have a theme for what I played the song of the day sounds, you know, it's like so typical.

131
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,720
But maybe today, I'll just be honest about it.

132
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,160
I'm really in the mood for something really hokey, you know, a 70s hokey song of the day,

133
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,480
Because we're For Shout-O-Pro Nelly for Tahoe, Jewel, or...

134
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,500
The 70s. This is Ricky Lee Jones. It's Chuck and Ben Love.

Yeah, yeah

144
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,160
Later, roll up the line, and then I'll just let me tell

145
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,720
You don't understand what it talks, it's true, it's true

146
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,000
You show it's a quiet, it's gotta be cool

147
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,120
Let's buy some jam, let it go

148
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,200
Well, then you can't get it, look too cute

149
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,400
Hey, you look the way

150
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,200
This is healthy, it's so kinda pinky

151
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Love

152
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,940
Chucky in the love

153
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,540
Chucky in the love

154
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,540
Chucky in the love

155
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,820
I don't believe what you say to me

156
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,420
This is solid

157
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,480
I've got that

158
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I look in the pool, how is it here?

159
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I look in the blood stall, what is it here?

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
No, don't come here no more

161
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No.
