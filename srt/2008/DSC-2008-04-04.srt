1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,200
It was $16 million worth of airplane scrapped to my ass, and the next generation radio

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,560
content in my ears.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,720
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You know, back in my day, full-barred mid-really, really bad things.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Then this Adam Curry comes along and he makes a good thing.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Everything's happy, lots of music people have in fun.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's on the DSC 743.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I hope you have fun with your full bar Friday.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm gonna sit here and eat my oatmeal.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Wait for Jeopardy to come on.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
From the 25th anniversary edition

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
of Michael Jackson's Thrill.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I was just dropped to my mailbox the other day.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
participation at the michaeljax.com slash podcast project.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,220
The 2008 remix of Beat It featuring Fergi and it sounded like a whole new

85
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:27,700
Eddie Van Halen. Super power solo on guitar and it's even cooler when artists

86
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,500
do their own mashups. I'm saying this is the Fubar Friday maximum music big

87
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,700
time hangover edition of the Charlie episode number 743 man. I am hurting today.

88
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,680
I'll tell you all about it when I'm late with the boys and you know me is a

89
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,920
non drinker. I should have stuck to my guns and not drunk. Well I did drink

90
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,200
drunk and I'm feeling the pain today my friends. Sorry.

91
00:04:51,200 --> 00:05:00,200
When I wake up in the morning I pull on my jeans and I'm feeling alright.

92
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:09,200
I pull my boots on. I pull my boots on. I pull my boots on. I pull my boots on.

93
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,200
I pull my boots on.

94
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,200
I pull my boots on. I pull my boots on. I pull my boots. I pull my boots...

95
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,200
All of these are all of these. I fell down at the airport. I knew they armed it here in eternity so

96
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:31,200
she'd keeprayed. I settled down like UT is a snack for a half a year. I would walk all day

97
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,200
I would be around the middle for three months. I just did get the idea and now this is just

98
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,200
a day with nothing了解 with these three backing sounds. I only need you to switch up and

99
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,200
And in the summer, the wind and the rain

100
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,200
And in the summer, the wind and the rain

101
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,200
And in the summer, the wind and the rain

102
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,200
And in the summer, the wind and the rain

103
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
And in the summer, the wind and the rain

104
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
And in the summer, the wind and the rain

105
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
And in the summer, the wind and the rain

106
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,200
And in the summer, the wind and the rain

107
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
And in the summer, the wind and the rain

108
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,200
And in the summer, the wind and the rain

109
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,200
And in the summer, the wind and the rain

110
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,200
And in the summer, the wind and the rain

111
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
And in the summer, the wind and the rain

112
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,200
And in the summer, the wind and the rain

113
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,200
And in the summer, the wind and rain

114
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,200
But in the summer, the wind and the rain

115
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
And in the summer, the wind and the rain

116
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,700
I'm gonna roll again

117
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,700
When I wake up in the morning light

118
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,200
I pull on my jeans and I'm feeling alright

119
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,200
I roll my boots on, I roll my boots on

120
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,200
I roll my boots on, I roll my boots on

121
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,200
I roll my boots on, I roll my boots on

122
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,200
I roll my boots on, I roll my boots on

123
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,200
When I wake up in the morning light

124
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,200
I pull on my jeans and I'm feeling alright

125
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I roll my boots on, I roll my boots on

126
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,200
David Dunn has guessed it's ready for the weekend

127
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Working his old blue jeans on

128
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,200
All the songs that are not from the concert music that work for this

129
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,200
For this footballer Friday are at least 30 years old

130
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
So just bear that in mind when you're saying, well man

131
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
I don't think I've ever heard that song before

132
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Besides the usual for a footballer Friday

133
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Which includes a young police hate test

134
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,200
And of course Sir Jersey Todd will be stopping by with his pick of the week

135
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
We've also got some financial talk today

136
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Lots of people interested in what's going on with the credit crunch

137
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
With financial markets and all

138
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
We're going to that a little bit later on

139
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Just kick back relax and get ready

140
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Now do you remember this song?

141
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Also 30 years old

142
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Fox

143
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Look at the phone

144
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,200
And come and sound

145
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,200
What they expected

146
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
You know tonight

147
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Just choose

148
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Shake them off

149
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,200
And while I go and turn

150
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,200
But there's a downside

151
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,200
I've got a lot to say

152
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Don't think

153
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
I ain't no one

154
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
I ain't no one

155
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
My way you're shaking

156
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
The mist of last train

157
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Cause I've got a lot to say

158
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
Don't think

159
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Shake them off

160
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
And they don't say

161
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Shake them off

162
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
And they don't know

163
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
I can't sleep here

164
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Shake them off

165
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Shake them off

166
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
And they don't say

167
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
I don't think

168
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,200
But they don't want such a tear

169
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Wanna solve such a whole thing

170
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Ooh

171
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Don't worry

172
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I don't worry

173
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
But we're going to explore

174
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Each of those minds

175
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,200
It's my turn to time, to hit flying

176
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:37,200
All the pleasures of life, all the choice of life

177
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,200
All the all I got is a single day

178
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Ain't no hope, you're sleeping, wow ain't no shame

179
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,200
All the all I got is a single day

180
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Ain't no hope, you're sleeping, wow ain't no shame

181
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Ain't no hope, you're sleeping, wow ain't no shame

182
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Ain't no hope, you're sleeping, wow ain't no shame

183
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,200
All the all I got is a single day

184
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Ain't no hope, you're sleeping, wow ain't no shame

185
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Ain't no hope, you're sleeping, wow ain't no shame

186
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Ain't no hope, you're sleeping, wow ain't no shame

187
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,200
All I got is a single day

188
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Ain't no hope, you're sleeping, wow ain't no shame

189
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Ain't no hope, you're sleeping, wow ain't no shame

190
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Ain't no hope, you're sleeping, wow ain't no shame

191
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Ain't no hope, you're sleeping, wow ain't no shame

192
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
I could use some cowbells.

193
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Probably the second most functional stuttering song I've ever heard of, of course,

194
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:43,200
there was my generation and when I was a small wee lad, it was fox and single bed.

195
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Hey everybody, how are you doing? Coming to you from the Courier Manor on the west side of

196
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
G-town, it is the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Ge offered.

197
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,200
It's daily source code episode number 7, 4, 3, it's the Fubar Friday maximum music

198
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,200
edition. Really we want the sponsors today. Today is in part brought to you by

201
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,200

202
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,200
of people are using e-music, a lot of pod save artists are using e-music these days.

203
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:24,200
So have a look at e-music.com slash daily source code e-music.com slash daily source code

204
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,200
35 free songs can be yours.

205
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,200
So yesterday I actually tweeted this, believe it or not.

206
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,200
I had a dinner lined up with super agent Keith.

207
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,200
There's a lot of business for BT Pod Show here in the UK.

208
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:47,200
And the meeting with the Rod Taylor, a couple guys actually from a two-way traffic

209
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,200
company that I think actually was just acquired by Sony Entertainment.

210
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,200
And they distribute who wants to be a millionaire.

211
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,200
So they're a pretty big in the television world.

212
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,200
And we've been working on a couple ideas and talking about some things.

213
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,200
And so we went to this club and super agent Keith.

214
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
I think it does the PR for this club as well.

215
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,200
It's called the five Cavendish Square.

216
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,200
It's obviously a very posh address if you know London at all.

217
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
And it's not a gentleman's club. It's a private club.

218
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
There's all kinds of benefits if you remember.

219
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,200
You can pretty much book a table in the restaurant or room for a function if you have.

220
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,200
I think they have a nightclub and maybe 15 hotel rooms.

221
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
It's all real.

222
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
I mean, it's done up well.

223
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
It's really, really classy.

224
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,200
And the owner is this lovely guy, Jay, who's Sicilian.

225
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,200
But I think he's been in the UK for 20 years or so.

226
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,200
But boy is he Sicilian.

227
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Italian from Sicily. Let me put it that way.

228
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
And we had a great time.

229
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
He said, man, these guys were hitting the bottles.

230
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,200
You know, and I'd love to drink a little bit of wine if I'm out and you know, have something with dinner.

231
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
You all know that.

232
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,200
And they had some excellent, excellent wine that was coming up from the dark depths of the dungeon there.

233
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:08,200
And then after dinner it was time for a smoke, a coheba cigar, which I haven't smoked the cigar.

234
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
And man, I'm going to say,

235
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,200
at least nine years, maybe ten years, certainly not a Cuban cigar like a coheba.

236
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,200
But of course, that kind of added, you know, to the whole mix of the great wine.

237
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
But then the mojitos came out.

238
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,200
And all I know is I was home at two o'clock this morning.

239
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,200
And when I woke up this morning, I felt like utter, utter shite.

240
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,200
I haven't felt this bad in a long time.

241
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Because as you know, I literally, I just don't drink.

242
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
I just, you know, as I said, a glass of wine, maybe.

243
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
And now I remember why.

244
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,200
Holy moly, and these guys were packing it away, just unbelievable.

245
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,200
So the good news made some good friends.

246
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Bad news.

247
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Feel like shite.

248
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Great news.

249
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,200
The foobars inform a thick foyer, everybody.

250
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Hi, it's Matt from Games Weasel here on this week's show.

251
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,200
We play around with probably about 2000 and eight on the Wii.

252
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Kick people in the face with condemned to on the 360.

253
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Nice.

254
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
I visit theplay.com live event at when we stay.

255
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
You can let you know how that went.

256
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,200
And you can win the new game of worms for the Wii.

257
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
That's all at Gamesweasel.com.

258
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:43,200
And I break all the holidays.

259
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Time to put the sign out.

260
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Don't make a fool.

261
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,200
And we'll want it so far.

262
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,200
They can say so but not.

263
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,200
That began with a rush.

264
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Look how far we have come.

265
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,200
You embrace.

266
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Bring in the game name.

267
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Show them that you slow her.

268
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Why you haunt my love.

269
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:31,200
So I can't let it on my breath.

270
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,200
That's why you told me you made.

271
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
This is our home.

272
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,200
And tomorrow's home.

273
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,200
I'm taking such a lot of watch.

274
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,200
That began with a rush.

275
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Look how far we have come.

276
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
You embrace.

277
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Look how far we have come.

278
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Look how far we have come.

279
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Look how far we have come.

280
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Come from my red lips, who are you talking to me?

281
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:51,160
This is our home, This is our home, This is our home

282
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:59,160
This is our home, This is our home

283
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,280
Grandpa

284
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,960
Grandpa

285
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,240
Grandpa

286
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,680
decided

287
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,040
Grandpa

288
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,740
Santa

289
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,740
Grandpa

290
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,700
Recommended by the

291
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,560
Incredibly desirable yet parlar

292
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,220
Unreachable

293
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,700
reachable, and G.B. Beth Hersh from the Potset Music Network and our song.

294
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,180
We routed that request by the way through Sir Jersey Todd, it can be crazy the way things work.

295
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:44,100
You know, I was speaking of which that article about the Potset Music Revolution is apparently

296
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,100
showing up in Billboard.

297
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,380
I think either this week or this coming week or the week after.

298
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:55,740
I have not read it, but I hope just considering the amount of people that the journalist

299
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,780
even interviewed, I hope it's going to be a great story because man, this stuff really

300
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,780
is just a great story.

301
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,580
By the way, you hear the birds tweeting in the background there, it's because it's another

302
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:09,660
beautiful day, the sun is out, it's nice and warm, and still they expect snow on Sunday.

303
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,300
I'm not quite sure what's going on with that.

304
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,780
And I'm really looking forward to a restful weekend, finally with the girls, I'm going to go,

305
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,820
I think we're actually going to go look at a car for Christina, who of course will be taking

306
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,140
your driver's test pretty soon.

307
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,340
And then Monday is the Lady Patricia's birthday Tuesday, I'm off to the states for a couple

308
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,340
days.

309
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,980
I know New York is definitely in play, but maybe even the quicksand friend trips.

310
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,540
So what I should be back by the next footballer Friday.

311
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,740
And of course on a footballer, what can you do?

312
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:45,300
What do we all look forward to from sea to shining sea from Europe down to down under to

313
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,620
the west coast of the United States, everybody plays along with Yarnpol.

314
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,620
Let's hit test.

315
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,660
Oh, you're fantastic.

316
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,420
I'm very pissed, this is the test.

317
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,660
Hit it test.

318
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,660
Yarnpol!

319
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,100
Hey Adam, it's time for our hit test again.

320
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,100
Right on.

321
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,860
So here we go with intro number one.

322
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:16,100
Um, uh, it's, uh, oh man, where's she from Saturday night fever or the girl?

323
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,100
You've got a vine element.

324
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100
Love it too.

325
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,100
You lost in music.

326
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,100
Oh, Yarnpol.

327
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
Mom.

328
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,100
And just a sledge of cry for it.

329
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,100
I grew up with that stuff, Yarn.

330
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,820
They get too easy on me.

331
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,820
Hit me number three.

332
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,820
And this is number three.

333
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:38,260
It's, uh, almost sounds like a, like a prince.

334
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,420
Little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little.

335
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,420
Did it.

336
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,500
And time for our hit on the answer.

337
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
So grab it.

338
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Yes.

339
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,140
And so number one is from 1982.

340
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,140
This is the kind element.

341
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:55,820
I want you as your sweet thing.

342
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,940
My face.

343
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,940
The world pays

344
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,940
Honey, you know the blue

345
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,940
Come with me in love, too

346
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,940
All we love and all we free from these love

347
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,940
Rains, Danny, all the world

348
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,940
So I wanna be a woman

349
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,940
If I'm element in love, things just answer number one

350
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,940
And this is answer number two from Night Channel, this is Sister Slag

351
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,940
Honey, you know the blue

352
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,940
Some people who's everything

353
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,940
First and go with the mind

354
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,940
Oh, I'll check music

355
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,940
Holding a trap

356
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,940
So I'll get on music

357
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,940
No turn it back

358
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

359
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,940
Lost in music, I guess answer number two

360
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,940
Two, two, this maximum music

361
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,940
Full of Friday, Friday, Friday, Sunday, edition of

362
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah

363
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,940
And this is answer number three from 1986

364
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,940
This is Nicole, don't you want my love

365
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,940
Oh man, I never listened to that kind of crap

366
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Yeah, I remember it now, thank you

367
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:24,940
Nicole is answer number three

368
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,940
In this disco version of the hit test number 116

369
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,940
Just proves I'm not a disco guy

370
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,940
You do this way

371
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,940
Two out of two, Yana, I didn't get the last disco tracks, sorry

372
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,940
The answers to this hit test together with the iTunes link

373
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,940
You can buy these tricks online or to be found at hittest.photshow.com

374
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,940
I don't think you're for playing

375
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,940
Thanks for making us

376
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,940
Thank you for listening, next week I'll be back for hit test number 117

377
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:54,940
So until then, have a very nice week and try to think with your heart

378
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,940
Bye bye

379
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,940
As a nice sign off, y'all think with your hearts, I like that

380
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,940
Think with your hearts and smell like fart

381
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,940
It's the daily source code to food bar Friday edition

382
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,940
We have a new friend of the Charlie

383
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,940
Chucklehead who is as many of you just a little bit extra special

384
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,940
And well, I can feel a Jeff Smith jingle coming on pretty soon

385
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,940
Hey there Adam, this is Steve Saler from Ontario Canada again

386
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,940
The official albino of the Charlie

387
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,940
Apparently

388
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,940
So I guess that means I should try to get myself a jingle

389
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,940
Really?

390
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,940
Yeah, I don't know

391
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,940
Thank you very much that

392
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,940
I mean, it's a lot actually that you kind of think that's cool about me being an albino

393
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,940
I mean, I've been living as an albino for 24 years

394
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,940
And you know, the novelty kind of starts to wear off

395
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,940
But

396
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,940
Dude, let me tell you something

397
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,940
I love people who are different

398
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,940
Because you're not boring, man

399
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,940
It's like, it's like the same thing my love for comic strip blogger

400
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,940
And Roger Smalls, wherever he may be

401
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,940
Yes, no, you're special, man

402
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,940
You're a massive chucklehead

403
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,940
The stairs somehow remain

404
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,940
I don't know

405
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,940
Actually, it's kind of funny

406
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,940
You actually

407
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,940
The DSC listeners, you guys rock

408
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,940
And I also hate you all as well

409
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,940
Because since I mentioned my website in the last comment

410
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,940
I didn't think that

411
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,940
Well, there actually is a DSC Charlie effect

412
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,940
Which trounces the dig effect apparently

413
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,940
Because after I mentioned my website

414
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,940
Yeah, my website crashed

415
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,940
Yeah, too many, too many hits to the website

416
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,940
And yeah, it was down for a long time

417
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,940
It took me at least about 20 hours

418
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,940
Just to really get it back up again

419
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,940
It's okay, I'm totally prepared for it now

420
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,940
So if you all had to Steve Sailor.net

421
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,940
It's cool, it's going to work this time

422
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,940
So anyway, I just wanted to say thank you

423
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,940
And also send a song your way for the footballer Friday

424
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,940
Actually, a little bit of backstory

425
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,940
Being a part of the radio broadcasting program

426
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,940
That's a pill to put on

427
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,940
Especially show on the college radio station

428
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,940
Which is 90.1 FM

429
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,940
The heat tonight or a new rock

430
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,940
Actually, you show that we do call this week in geek

431
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,940
And it's also a podcast that's found at this week in geek.net

432
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,940
And it's a show that we do the cover

433
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,940
All things geek-oriented topics

434
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,940
From video games to movies, TV shows, you name it

435
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,940
We talk about it

436
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,940
And one of the segments we started on there

437
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,940
Was called The Rantings of a Double D

438
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,940
And it's done by my friend Dave Dennis

439
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,940
Or always known as Double D

440
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:33,940
And he does these weird kind of geeky random two to five minutes segments each week

441
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,940
And they've become so popular that he decided to go into the musical route

442
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,940
And with the help of our producer Pierre Sturks

443
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,940
Who composed in the music for the Double D Rants

444
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,940
They came up with a very interesting song

445
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,940
And I'm going to preface this by saying

446
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,940
If you know the short circuit movies

447
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,940
Back in the 80s with that little cute robot

448
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,940
John, you found it?

449
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,940
Yeah

450
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,940
Well, this is a little romantic techno-ditty

451
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,940
That deals with those movies

452
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,940
So Adam, I bring to you and the Charlie listeners

453
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,940
You can find the song now on the pot-save music network

454
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,940
The Rantings of a Double D

455
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,940
Short circuit, my heart

456
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,940
Hope you enjoy it, bye

457
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,940
John, bye

458
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,940
Came alive

459
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,940
It's all my heart away

460
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,940
Now we're new together

461
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,940
Getting better and every day

462
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,940
All I'm in for a little more friends

463
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,940
Like I'm the luckyest girl in town

464
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,940
It feels like I'm lucky and hooked around

465
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,940
When the heart is in your hand

466
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,940
Short circuit, my heart

467
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,940
Short circuit, my heart

468
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,940
Short circuit, my heart

469
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,940
Short circuit, my heart

470
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,940
We were together

471
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,940
We came and tried to take my love away

472
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,940
Oh, my little Johnny

473
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,940
You will always say the day

474
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,940
And looking for something but

475
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,940
And you know I can't survive

476
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,940
I just want you

477
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,940
When you want something I know

478
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,940
You know I can't deny

479
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,940
Short circuit, my heart

480
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,940
Short circuit, my heart

481
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,940
Short circuit, my heart

482
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,940
Short circuit, my heart

483
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,940
Hope you enjoy it, bye

484
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,940
Now we're new together

485
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,940
Getting better and every day

486
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,940
All I'm in for a little more friends

487
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,940
Like I'm the luckyest girl in town

488
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,940
Short circuit, my heart

489
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,940
Short circuit, my heart

490
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,940
Short circuit, my heart

491
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,940
Short circuit, my heart

492
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,940
Short circuit, my heart

493
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:44,940
Short circuit, my heart

494
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,940
Maybe I'd have such a red tone

495
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,940
Alright, it's coming from an unofficial albino

496
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,940
A Sherman, my heart

497
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,940
I've discarded people

498
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,940
The ranting of Double D

499
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,940
Short circuit, my heart

500
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,940
Wasn't there a

501
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:11,140
Was it like a debarge song or something that was about Johnny five who's Johnny?

502
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,940
Something like that?

503
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,940
I recall.

504
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,940
You've done it all.

505
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,940
When you pulled your memory cold.

506
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,940
I pulled the memory through the door.

507
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,940
I pulled the memory through the door.

508
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,940
I pulled the memory through the door.

509
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,940
You're supposed to gain no matter what you say.

510
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,940
The only better way.

511
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,940
What's the ball?

512
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,940
Right, right, right.

513
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:50,940
How can you tell us so many lies?

514
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,940
Come on, let me see me in this world.

515
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,940
I'll do what you want.

516
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:07,940
There's nothing left.

517
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,940
Oh, God, this runs away.

518
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:19,940
Maybe you carry far away.

519
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,940
It's just a test.

520
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,940
Again, for us to play.

521
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:32,940
We know this, it's hard to smile.

522
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,940
This is what it says.

523
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,940
It's true itself.

524
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,940
You have to hide.

525
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:49,940
Come on, let me see me in this world.

526
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,940
I'll do what you want.

527
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,940
The only one.

528
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:29,940
There ain't no more.

529
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,940
It'll take you to everything.

530
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:40,940
But believe it's my love.

531
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:47,940
Can you ignore my big, mean everything?

532
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:54,940
Because I know what big means and what it's worth.

533
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,940
I'll wait the way.

534
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:05,940
I don't say, maybe you carry far away.

535
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:12,940
Come on, let me see me in this world.

536
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:19,940
I'll do what you want.

537
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,940
Definitely songs from the soundtrack to our lives.

538
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,940
Steve Harley.

539
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,940
I'm pretty sure I mentioned this before, but the...

540
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,940
Those vocals?

541
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,940
That you hear now?

542
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:40,940
That's actually the Lady Patricia's sister, Lady Yvonne, back in the day.

543
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:47,940
When it was her turn to live in London, hanging out with Steve Harley and that whole gang.

544
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,940
I love it.

545
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,940
Oh, what a great way to get out of the weekend, man.

546
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,940
This is fantastic.

547
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,940
Nothing but songs you love.

548
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,940
And we're filled with savants today as well.

549
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,940
We had, of course, our official Obino of the show.

550
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,940
We had a young play with a hit test.

551
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,940
Of course, you got this new dude on the scene.

552
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,940
New chucklehead.

553
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,940
The lemonade man from the Netherlands.

554
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,940
Hello Adam and DC's listeners.

555
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,940
It's the lemonade man here.

556
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,940
Now that I catch up with the DC,

557
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,940
I'm also catching up with the podcast of a Dutch news show called

558
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,940
Method Al-Goborra.

559
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,940
A radio show of the NOS by Rick Broadcaster in the Netherlands.

560
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,940
There I hear this fragment, which I will translate afterwards.

561
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,940
At FD's, we have that psychotiroparter,

562
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,940
that since January, on the Zorfer's day,

563
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,940
Karam would have melded.

564
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,940
It was a kind of behandling.

565
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,940
That's why this is a misunderstanding of the privacy.

566
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,940
This is a bang that he gave us.

567
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,940
By the other half of the news comes,

568
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,940
so that iemandie depressivis starts before it.

569
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,940
He will take me to sleep.

570
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,940
So, it's a psychotiroparter,

571
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,940
which is the kind of regulation of health insurance companies

572
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,940
to supply the reason, of course, sort of a patient,

573
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,940
which is in their opinion,

574
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,940
a violation of privacy.

575
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,940
For example, if an insurance company has a death case,

576
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,940
it could be that this information lands on the wrong desk,

577
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,940
and someone who wants to refer to depression

578
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,940
is refuse a landing.

579
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,940
So, next time, if you meet someone who claims to have enough to hide,

580
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,940
you can use this as example,

581
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,940
how you suddenly can become someone with something to hide,

582
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,940
or make a point that you don't necessarily have to be a bad guy

583
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,940
to be in need of some privacy.

584
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,940
Yeah, no kidding, man.

585
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,940
And I think you're doing exactly the right thing,

586
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,940
what will happen with increasing frequency in our lives?

587
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,940
We'll see these types of connections being made,

588
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,940
databases linked up, information flowing through agencies

589
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,940
from one agency to the next,

590
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,940
with that information being tagged and added onto,

591
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,940
and before you know it,

592
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,940
well, that movie you may have seen on curry.com,

593
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,940
a couple weeks back about the pizza ordering.

594
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,940
It could actually come true,

595
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,940
but I'm glad to hear that this is now coming to the forefront.

596
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,940
So, the fact that it was on the news,

597
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,940
and that the doctors are unhappy with it,

598
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,940
that that's good, the fact that you're sharing it with us,

599
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,940
is fantastic.

600
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,940
And that's what we'll stop all the lunacy.

601
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,940
Just got to stay awake, stay alert,

602
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,940
and stay on top of our game, my friends.

603
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
That's the trick.

604
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,940
You've got her.

605
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,940
I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out.

606
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,940
You're on her.

607
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,940
Please don't bang that gavel.

608
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,940
You can try this cowbell out.

609
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,940
Let's don't give a nod.

610
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,940
To the hardest working lawyers,

611
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,940
your turns in time, and then it's Jersey tight,

612
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,940
oh yeah.

613
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,940
You're on her.

614
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,940
What do you say?

615
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,940
You might even win this case.

616
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,940
Jersey.

617
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,940
Yeah.

618
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,940
Oh, how's it going?

619
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,940
Adam and Jersey tied the official musicologist of the Chacha.

620
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,940
Have I got a man for you this week?

621
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:03,700
old school, at least an old school feel. The band is animate objects. I like these guys. They've

622
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:09,780
got that cool kind of old school feel to them and they've got some amazing amazing lyrics.

623
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:15,780
I just dig them a lot. Check it out. It's animate objects with clot on your football Friday.

624
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:54,940
Yeah, I'm right back a lot, absolutely. It has been in the hopper. We'll ask to be in a race and ride a track, y'all

625
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:59,940
back to me, 20 things, y'all know when they're back to me. Actually, that's why you're hatein' me.

626
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,940
What's now sitting around the deal at the major T-8? The freshman in this game, none hazein' me.

627
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,940
Hip-hop, kid-hop, cold place of scene. But it ends of the beach, I'll be praising me.

628
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,940
We know we're up and down like a race of season patiently. As the world says, keep turning, wax me, burn in props.

629
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:21,940
We earned in France, we earned it, it's for 13. We fuckers in your clothes, the curses. So we ain't shuckin' it, y'all be joking.

630
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,940
This guy's been rocking with the bra of it, they ain't shit. That's from the city you're coming.

631
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,940
The DJ is not evil on him, we don't provoke you. That's the rest of my joke here.

632
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,940
We're guilty, they're gonna smoke you. You can ask me, though, when he press an enrollment.

633
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,940
They get the same impression in Poland, just be a case. You're a people forget, we ain't y'all win the shot.

634
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:45,940
And we make it a hop, too. Make it hot, get whatever you got from the set for the river.

635
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,940
And then it goes right up, and then I get whatever you got from the set for the river.

636
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,940
And then it goes right, make it hot, get whatever you got from the set for the river.

637
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,940
And then it goes right, make it hot, get whatever you got from the set for the river.

638
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:16,940
And then it goes like, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot.

639
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,940
And then it goes right, make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we

640
00:38:49,940 --> 00:39:19,940
make it hot, we make it cold, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot cold, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot, we make it hot,

641
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,940
Yeah, when we said full of real hip hop and then it goes right

642
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,740
Make it hard, give way, never you got

643
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,340
When we said full of real hip hop and then it goes right

644
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,140
Make it hard, give way, never you got

645
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,740
When we said full of real hip hop and then it goes right

646
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,540
Make it hard, give way, never you got

647
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,140
When we said full of real hip hop and then it goes right

648
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,740
Make it hard, give way, never you got

649
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,540
When we said full of real hip hop and then it goes right

650
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,140
Make it hard, give way, never you got

651
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,740
When we said full of real hip hop and then it goes right

652
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,740
Make it hard, give way, never you got

653
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,740
Would you take to the T?

654
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,740
When we said full of real hip hop and then it goes right

655
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,420
If that's John fulfilled me in a long time

656
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,780
Jersey thought the master of ceremonies

657
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,500
What comes to musicology sends us anomade

658
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,100
like that, a lot of men definitely cool

659
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,940
a check-in mod the podcast music network links

660
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,580
In the show, a notice of course

661
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,540
At dailysourcecode.com

662
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,740
Told you the sponsors were able to control

663
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,580
Today

664
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,940
I want to kind of tune their own horn for a moment here

665
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,020
But our Nokia N110

666
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,900
Campaign that we've been running where you can kinds of

667
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,540
65

668
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,580
You can buy these

669
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,940
Do you can buy them through a number of

670
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,740
Potio programs

671
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:22,220
And you can't get this device cheaper anywhere else online.

672
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,060
We have absolutely the best deals,

673
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,780
like a 15% discount in the prices.

674
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,660
I mean, it's all sub 400 bucks now, and this thing is,

675
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,700
and by the way, folks, once in a while,

676
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:36,700
I get another email or a voice mail about the flash players,

677
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,980
or about the flash plugin not working on the player.

678
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,940
Just go to your settings for your browser,

679
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,380
which of course is completely web 2.0 compliant,

680
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,100
understands Ajax and Flash.

681
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,700
The iPhone doesn't do that in case you didn't know.

682
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,940
So you couldn't watch all the YouTube videos on this thing.

683
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,740
And the two-ing our own horn thing is,

684
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,260
we're actually responsible for like a large percentage

685
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,300
of all sales in Canada, you know?

686
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,900
It's like crazy.

687
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,060
It's really working out.

688
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,580
So go to my show notes, you'll see a link there.

689
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,860
And of course, you wanna use the daily source code promo code

690
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,460
to get your massive discount

691
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:13,220
and get this awesome device, which I'm just having a good time

692
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,060
with still.

693
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,700
It really is my computer, when I don't wanna computer,

694
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,300
when I just wanna sit down on the couch,

695
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,900
chill out and still have my Skype,

696
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,700
and my YouTube capabilities,

697
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,580
right near their flash stuff, just loving it.

698
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,300
Promise you a couple of svons,

699
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,580
or not just svons, but some questions about

700
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,100
to the credit crunch and about finance.

701
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,980
I do wanna delve into that before we hit the weekend.

702
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,860
So here's the first of those two.

703
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,700
Oh, sorry about that.

704
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,540
Here we go.

705
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,140
Hello Adam Poledogless Boyer of the MadModemachene.com.

706
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:40,980
Oh, wait a minute.

707
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,540
I need to have this show on our network.

708
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,500
MadModemachene podcast, like it.

709
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,020
Custom blog here.

710
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,860
You and I are arriving at the same fascination

711
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,860
at the same time, and that is,

712
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,500
what is going on behind the scenes with our money?

713
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,620
Man, love the reverb.

714
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,500
Now, on a previous no agenda,

715
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,260
you talked with John C to work about the meaning of gold.

716
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,300
You ask, why is gold so viable?

717
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,980
And John said, well, it's because they make jewelry out of it

718
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,820
and they use an electronics.

719
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,580
Gold is viable because it's rare.

720
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:14,820
And you know, for most of the previous 6,000 years gold,

721
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,620
itself was used as money.

722
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,580
And so when produced in the shape of a coin

723
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:25,580
and standardized, we now have a fixed value for that money.

724
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,020
Now, throughout all those 6,000 previous years of history,

725
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:32,460
there's been this struggle between real money

726
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,580
and government-controlled money.

727
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,780
And right now, the pendulum has swung completely

728
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,740
to government-controlled money.

729
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,700
But I encourage you to take a look at a book called The Creature

730
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,820
from Jekyll Island, subtitled a second look

731
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,780
at the Federal Reserve.

732
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,340
You know, I've had this ongoing conversation all week

733
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:55,780
with John ever since I really start broaching this topic.

734
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:58,820
And I think that there's a lot of conspiracy theory stuff

735
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,700
going on about the Federal Reserve.

736
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,740
Stuff that actually doesn't really matter anymore.

737
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,580
How it was created, or why it was created,

738
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,260
the fact that it is, is really the problem at hand.

739
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,380
And this whole Jekyll Island thing, that is a major conspiracy theory.

740
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,620
But I think it's almost distraction because it doesn't matter.

741
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,460
You know, it's something happened, whether it took place

742
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,940
in Jekyll Island, whether it was cloak and dagger stuff or not.

743
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,340
But yes, I'm very familiar with that.

744
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,380
And it is a very interesting theory, of course,

745
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,580
if you're into your conspiracy things.

746
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,740
But again, I'm just more interested in how it works

747
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,860
and how the money flows and what the Fed does

748
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,380
and who calls the shots, really, and who says,

749
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,380
let's make some more money and where can that go?

750
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,100
And do we realize that that is actually a hidden tax

751
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,780
because our dollar becomes less valuable?

752
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,860
Well, that's where I'm at my friend.

753
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,140
But please do continue.

754
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,540
By G. Edward Griffin, there is a one hour long talk he gave

755
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,860
about this subject.

756
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,740
You can find this one hour talk at Spielbauer.com slash

757
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,660
Jekyll download.htm.

758
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,900
Spielbauer is SPIL, B-A-U-E-R.

759
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:05,380
.com slash Jekyll, J-E-K-Y-L-L download.

760
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,980
It's got HTM and it's a fascinating talk

761
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,300
about the behind the scenes working of money.

762
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,500
I would love to see us have real money again.

763
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,780
Beautiful coins made out of precious metals.

764
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,060
You know, the UK, I just saw on the paper yesterday,

765
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,220
they're coming out with new coins.

766
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,340
So they were placing the pound, the five pens,

767
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,220
the 10 pens, the 20 pens, the 50 pens.

768
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,820
I don't think they were placing the two pound coin,

769
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,900
at least I didn't see it.

770
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,140
Actually, I was thinking, yeah, it's just coins.

771
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,420
But if you're putting new coins in a circulation,

772
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,220
and of course, what's interesting to me

773
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:48,980
is the timing of this new coin bringing into the new circulation

774
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,580
of money, even though it's just coins.

775
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:56,860
I mean, still, you can easily put several hundred million

776
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,020
into circulation in new coin, and of course,

777
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:02,700
you're supposed to take the old coins out of circulation.

778
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,860
But it's not interesting that that would happen

779
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,340
at this very moment when it seems like money needs

780
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,820
to be injected into the system.

781
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,380
I wonder if that actually has anything to do

782
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,900
with the timing of this, and they clearly can't take coins

783
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,380
out of circulation, the old ones out,

784
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,460
and then put new ones in.

785
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,580
I presume there's some kind of sliding scale,

786
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,180
but just interesting to me.

787
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,380
And then, of course, paper certificates

788
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,900
that are redeemable in precious metal coins.

789
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,860
And then, ultimately, the elimination of the federal reserve

790
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,780
and control government control over money.

791
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,860
In why is government control money so bad?

792
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,540
Well, it's because by printing more of it,

793
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,260
they create inflation.

794
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,780
Did you know that in Roman times, an ounce of gold

795
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,740
could buy a nice suit of clothes in the 1700s,

796
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,020
an ounce of gold could buy a nice suit of clothes.

797
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,460
And today, an ounce of gold can buy a nice suit of clothes.

798
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,820
That is a fantastic observation.

799
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,700
Indeed, with gold about, what is it, $1,000 a Troy ounce?

800
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,940
You could indeed buy a really nice suit.

801
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,060
That's a fascinating thought that that value has stayed

802
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,260
the same throughout centuries.

803
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,540
So with gold as money, there is no inflation.

804
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,340
Well, maybe a little bit as they dig more of it out of the ground.

805
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,260
And did you know Adam that a penny from 1982 or earlier

806
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:23,020
is made out of pure copper and it's worth two and a half cents?

807
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:27,340
You can find out more details at coinflation.com.

808
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,060
I'm going to be talking about the behind-the-scenes

809
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,220
looking money on my show at madmanemachine.com.

810
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,540
Thanks, Adam, insert standard closing here.

811
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,140
I love you, Nina, man.

812
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,300
Interesting.

813
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,340
Of course, all that's 2020 hindsight, I guess.

814
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:47,100
But it's fun to see how many people are responding

815
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,620
to this conversation about money, speaking of which,

816
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:54,380
if you die and you want your spouse or your other dependence

817
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,580
to get tons of dough,

818
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,460
have I got a deal for you?

819
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,540
I can sell you some life insurance, my friends,

820
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,140
up to 70% discount at acu-quote.com.

821
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,700
Here's what you want to do if you're interested.

822
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,580
And anyone should have some form of life insurance.

823
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,700
And there's other insurances you can get from acu-quote as well.

824
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:14,900
But please check out acu-quote.com slash DSC.

825
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,180
Or if you put this into your phone right now,

826
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,260
you don't have to call it now, but just put this in plus one.

827
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:23,460
In the stage, you might do 001, but just hit the plus sign.

828
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:28,220
Plus one, 800, 410, 7214.

829
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,420
If you missed it, just rewind a couple of seconds

830
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,420
and put that in your phone.

831
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,100
That's also a, these guys are pretty cool the way they set it up.

832
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,620
That's also a special custom DSC phone line,

833
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:40,260
so they'll know that you came through the, through the Charlie.

834
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,540
Make sure you get some life insurance.

835
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,980
You can always name me as the beneficiary.

836
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,660
I got no problem with that whatsoever.

837
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,540
So we stick with one more, and then we'll do two songs.

838
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,940
We'll get out of here, get ready for the weekend.

839
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:48,780
I think so.

840
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,620
Good one.

841
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,820
This is the last bit of feedback on finance,

842
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,060
but I think you'll like it.

843
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,100
Hi there, Mr. Curry.

844
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:57,100
My name is Lee Brown, and I find your conversation

845
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,860
about the current credit crunch and everything else

846
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,380
that's happening at the moment, very interesting.

847
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,740
Now, I've got a question, and it's probably very stupid,

848
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,380
and I apologize, and it's fun.

849
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,540
No, no, no, no, hold on a second.

850
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,940
You do realize, of course, that there's no such thing

851
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,820
as a stupid question on the Charlie.

852
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:17,780
I'm sorry for that, but what I don't understand

853
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,860
is that if the same amount of money is still in circulation

854
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:24,020
in the sense where people who've been making money

855
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:28,340
have waxed into bank accounts, and then those banks,

856
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,300
and now reinvesting that money into other things,

857
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,540
then surely the circulation of money is still about.

858
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,540
So why have we suddenly turned up into a credit crunch?

859
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,220
Obviously, people who've had mortgages

860
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:48,220
are being paying those mortgage debts into mortgage providers,

861
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,220
and those mortgage providers, obviously,

862
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:54,580
wacking that into the bank, and also learning it out

863
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,900
further into other people, which are then obviously paying it back.

864
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,940
So if the circulation is still about,

865
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:04,540
why have we then turned up into a credit crunch,

866
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,660
if that makes sense?

867
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,620
I'd like to hear your thoughts.

868
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,140
I don't know, I've searched around a bit,

869
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,820
and I don't really really found out any information like that.

870
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,500
So I love the show.

871
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,460
Hope you can answer that stupid question,

872
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,780
and I hope to hear from you soon.

873
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:23,620
Thanks a lot.

874
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,940
Oh man, I think it's the crux of the question right there,

875
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,740
that it's really good because indeed,

876
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,500
the money is still in circulation,

877
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,740
but what's happening is banks are lending out more money

878
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,900
than they actually have.

879
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,900
So that's where a second, let me just put that on silence there.

880
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,620
So the banks are lending out more money than they have,

881
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,980
there go lending out more than it's in circulation.

882
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,380
And all of this is built on trust,

883
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:53,660
because they trusted their mortgage brokers,

884
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:57,380
that the brokers were finding appropriate people

885
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:00,220
to lend out this money to this phantom money.

886
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:05,220
And of course, the banks in turn were basing that phantom,

887
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,220
the phantom payments, because they stopped occurring

888
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,580
when rate went up or when situations changed.

889
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,340
They in turn were using that to guarantee

890
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,820
their own lending and borrowing business with other banks.

891
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,420
And the real problem is, is just no one trusts

892
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,180
what anyone else says.

893
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,860
And it comes from the trust between the mortgage broker

894
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,820
and the borrower, which in many cases was,

895
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:29,540
oh, just pure stupidity and greedy on the borrower side.

896
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,700
And I have to say, I'm really sorry.

897
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,820
Yes, you got scammed.

898
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,660
Yes, it was part of a large overall scam,

899
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,700
but it should happen, you know?

900
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,660
And sometimes you just got to learn the hard way.

901
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,140
And I know that sounds unsympathetic,

902
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,820
but you have to learn if you want to play this game.

903
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,820
And, you know, this should also make you think twice

904
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,380
about eulas and software licenses,

905
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,340
and all kinds of terms of service and things

906
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,660
that you just take for granted and just say,

907
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,740
okay, I'll do it and sign off on.

908
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,100
And if these things are too complicated and overbearing,

909
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,820
then hey, look, where the customer,

910
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,100
we're king, we should say stop, this is dumb.

911
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,460
We're all gonna lose, because we learn that this is not

912
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,620
the way to do it.

913
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,540
So it's something, I hope that gives you some form of answer.

914
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,780
It's somewhere in the middle there

915
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,660
as I think what you're looking for,

916
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,780
but it is all about this idea of fractional reserve lending,

917
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:31,140
which is lending out more money than you actually have

918
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,900
to cover that and then turning around

919
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:36,140
and taking that phantom money that you think

920
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,860
you'll one day get back and lending that out,

921
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,020
or borrowing against that from other banking institutions.

922
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:45,220
It's really, it's just been whipping this money around

923
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,900
or these figures, because it's not really money,

924
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,060
it's just data in computer systems.

925
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,900
1s and 0s been whipping around

926
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,020
and people have been, of course,

927
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,220
been taking those 1s and 0s and commissions

928
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,140
and in bonuses and pumping that parts of that back

929
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,700
into the economy, the luxury markets, I would say.

930
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,420
But at the end of the day, yeah,

931
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,060
it's something was bound to go wrong.

932
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,420
And I think, well, today what I've done,

933
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,020
I've popped my 401k,

934
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,540
I've taken all the money out,

935
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:17,540
because of course, that was invested in US based funds.

936
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,300
I've transferred all that money into euros,

937
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,860
I'm keeping as much money as possible in euros,

938
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,740
I believe the United States is headed for,

939
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,380
definitely headed for a recession.

940
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,540
It could actually be a pretty shitty one,

941
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,460
when I think about it.

942
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,380
And was that movie I talked about

943
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,340
or that documentary I talked about the other day?

944
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:42,340
I was on the BBC, George Soros also agrees.

945
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,180
He says there's gonna be a US recession,

946
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,740
but the extent of it, even he doesn't know exactly

947
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,100
what that's gonna be.

948
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:50,980
That's all right, my friends,

949
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,500
so just stick with me, I've got all the answers.

950
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,500
We'll be fine, won't we?

951
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,340
Huh?

952
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:58,460
Oh, man, we will if we got some good tunes.

953
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,780
Here's one that is over 40 years old,

954
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,660
but a song that is definitely a sound part

955
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,380
of the soundtrack to my life.

956
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,820
I know all the words by heart,

957
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,460
I have no idea where I picked him up

958
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,460
other than my parents playing this at home.

959
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,300
I love you.

960
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,140
I love you.

961
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:13,460
I love you.

962
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:18,460
He wanted to give her everything.

963
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:21,460
Flower, present,

964
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:26,500
and most of all, a wedding ring.

965
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,540
He saw a sign for a stock car race.

966
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,940
$1,000 right, it ran.

967
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:41,140
He couldn't get Laura on the phone.

968
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:45,380
So to her mother, Tommy said,

969
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:50,180
tell her I love her.

970
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:55,740
Tell her I hate her.

971
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:59,580
Tell her I may be late.

972
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:04,580
I've something to do that cannot wait.

973
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,020
He drove his car to the racing ground.

974
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,940
He was the youngest driver there.

975
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:22,940
The crowd roar as they started the race.

976
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:27,220
From the track they drove at a deadly pace.

977
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:32,220
No one knows what happened that day.

978
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:37,220
How his car overturned in flames,

979
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:41,220
but as they pulled him from the twisted wreck

980
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:46,220
with his dying grin, they heard him say.

981
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:51,220
Tell her I love her.

982
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:56,220
Tell her I need her.

983
00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:00,220
Tell her I'm not to cry.

984
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:07,220
My love for her will let her die.

985
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:15,220
Now in the chapel, one more great.

986
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:19,220
For her, Tommy, who passed away.

987
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,220
It was just for Laura.

988
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:24,220
He lived and died alone.

989
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,220
In the chapel, he can hear him cry.

990
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,220
Tell her I love her.

991
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:38,220
Tell her I need her.

992
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:42,220
Tell her I'm not to cry.

993
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:48,220
My love for her will let her die.

994
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,220
Don't you just love that story?

995
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,220
Isn't it just beautiful?

996
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:02,220
You probably noticed I haven't mentioned live 365 today.

997
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:07,220
I'm not streaming this live because there's something weird with the internet.

998
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,220
I have an idea.

999
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:13,220
Although I'm not quite sure I've been trying to do some troubleshooting here and there.

1000
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:16,220
But is there something wrong with one of the big backhaul carriers?

1001
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,220
Maybe level three is having some issues.

1002
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:23,220
Because I'm just seeing broken connections to certain certain sites who I don't know.

1003
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,220
Like Google has been really difficult.

1004
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,220
Gmail has been tough.

1005
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:32,220
But other sites, you know, blazingly fast connectivity and live 365.

1006
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,220
It kind of started yesterday.

1007
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:38,220
And it's like packets were getting dropped and I just really don't understand why.

1008
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:41,220
Now I have two networks in the house and it's happening on both of them.

1009
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:45,220
So I don't think it's it's the local ISPs necessarily.

1010
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:50,220
Although they may all be connected to the same peering provider or backhaul or whatever.

1011
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:57,220
But I just I didn't want to give anyone a bad experience because I think that that kind of sucked when we do the show on Wednesday.

1012
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,220
People just it really wasn't worth it.

1013
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,220
And I don't think it's live 365's fault.

1014
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,220
But if you know anything about that, please let me know.

1015
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,220
Because just drive them me now.

1016
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,220
So otherwise I'm going to start troubleshooting my own connection.

1017
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:10,220
And I'll hell, who wants to do that over the weekend.

1018
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:13,220
Particularly since this weekend.

1019
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:18,220
I'm looking forward to my big rebuttal to John C. Dvorak regarding reality television.

1020
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,220
So I got better fish to fry.

1021
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,220
Much bigger ones my friends.

1022
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,220
We came in with Mike less leave with Mike.

1023
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,220
He's rocking Robin from a long time ago.

1024
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:30,220
Can I sit with each other hard in love?

1025
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,220
I've been in a bottle since I had some.

1026
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,220
I've been in a bottle since I had some.

1027
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,220
I've been in a bottle since I had some.

1028
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,220
I've been in a bottle since I had some.

1029
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,220
I've been in a bottle since I had some.

1030
