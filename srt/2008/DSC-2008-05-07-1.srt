1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Dองest.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,120
Delta share a Charlie.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,820
Seventh five six.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,120
I did fairly source code.

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,520
The $16 million worth of airplane went climbing strapped by ass.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,280
Breathe, breathe°

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,800
The nexturing would reach me

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,080
Research themselves down the stage

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,080
We might not need nasty

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,640
Be strategic

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,000
honesty

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,840
I like the music

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,880
türk 많이 teach me

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,380
Your Go

15
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,920
podcasting is led neste

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,160
By the unreיבing of big, nice proteins

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,540
The street gotta be obvious

18
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,420
You've got to follow in your face

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,480
You make this bright

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,080
analyses

21
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,560
Kirkin Y

22
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,800
Survey

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,040
Pre- Shameless

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,680
I cover all you

25
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:09,520
But you're a young man, I'm not trying to get the three gonna take on the one thumb

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,520
They got blood on your face, your big discreet waving your thunder on

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,520
We will, we will, I'll you, sing it on

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:29,520
We will, we will, I'll you, I'll you, I'll you

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,520
I'll you, I'll you, I'll you

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:44,520
I'll you, I'll you, I'll you

31
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:51,520
I'll you, I'll you, I'll you, I'll you

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,520
But you're a normal man, I'm not being with your eyes

33
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Gonna make you something someday, you got blood on your face

34
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,520
Big discreet waving your thunder on your face

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,520
Your leg, we will, we will, I'll you, I'll you, I'll you

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,520
I'll you, I'll you, I'll you, I'll you, I'll you

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Everybody we will, we will, we will, I'll you

38
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,520
I'll much of a mind mess up is that

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,520
You're ready from the scene and this thing something completely different

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Paranoia, as like coming to you from these splice trips

41
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,520
These from homegrown productions, everybody is dead in source code 756

42
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,520
It's a food bar fried, so let's keep this vibe going

43
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,520
Non-matched up with your recognized and rainbow since you've been gone

44
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,520
For the Friday festivities, maximum music freight train

45
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,520
Same old dreams, same time every night

46
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Follow the ground, never wake up

47
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,520
So I get out of bed, but I'm not shoes in my head

48
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Don't fight back to break up

49
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,520
These bow holes are closing in

50
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Look at the picture of me

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,520
Sit to the ground, sit to the ground

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,520
All of the head can't take it

53
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Could I be wrong, or take it to the ground

54
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,520
You can't just bounce off, break it

55
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Bitch, you'll be gone, so in that I stand

57
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,520
If it's the last dream, I'll be the world that you sent to me

58
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,520
I could take it after no good night

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Time comes around just soon

60
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,520
You can't know what you need to mean

61
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Your boys and ladders, you can't agree

62
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,520
Just go to show you don't care about me

63
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Sit to the ground, sit to the ground

64
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,520
All of the head can't take it

65
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Could I be wrong, or take it to the ground

66
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,520
You can't just bounce off, break it

67
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

68
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,520
Bitch, you'll be gone

69
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:29,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

70
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Bitch, you'll be gone

71
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,520
All of the head can't take it

72
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Could I be wrong, or take it to the ground

73
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,520
You can't just bounce off, break it

74
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

75
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,520
Bitch, you'll be gone, so in that I stand

76
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,520
If it's the last dream, I'll take it

77
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

78
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Bitch, you'll be gone

79
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,520
The infallible Richie Blackmore and Rainbow

80
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
Since you've been gone

81
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,520
You know, I think it was some live album somewhere from Rainbow

82
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,520
I think it's live in Japan or something

83
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
I think it was Rainbow

84
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,520
We actually hear, actually hear Richie playing a solo

85
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
And you hear is a finger snap

86
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,520
I think it's like a pinky finger broke somehow

87
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,520
I've got to find out

88
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Hey, everybody, it is the Daily Source Code

89
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey

90
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,520
Known as Gilford, we're on the west side of, or actually

91
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,520
We're on the west side of G-Town

92
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,520
Another beautiful day, Cabo case ceiling visibility

93
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,520
Okay, all the nine's was a little overcast early this morning

94
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,520
We're going to get to more overcast weather in the next couple of days

95
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,520
We're on the south, lots of people on vacation in Spain

96
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,520
And Portugal and Northern Africa and bummed out

97
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,520
Because it's a rain in there

98
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,520
Oh, shit

99
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,520
A bee just flew in the window

100
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Hey, I've changed the setup a little bit

101
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,520
I don't know how it sounds

102
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,520
I have a different processing chain on the microphone

103
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
I hope you like it

104
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
Oh, my goodness, let me see

105
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
We've got a couple of things to get to

106
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Today, I want to keep the freight train rolling

107
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,520
Because we are on a Fubar Friday Express

108
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,520
Which means lots of music, minimum talk, all kinds of BS

109
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,520
Come in your way, check out this cat fight

110
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,520
Ah, a little bit of infighting going on here

111
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,520
James, I was a frequent caller

112
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,520
The show here and Charles, who's a drunken Londoner

113
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
He didn't like me supporting Boris Johnson

114
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Not that I actually endorsed him or anything

115
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,520
But I have to say I do like the fact that Boris Johnson is taking a stand

116
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,520
As a June 1st, no more open containers of alcohol

117
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,520
Permitted on public transport

118
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,520
I agree 100%

119
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,520
If this one thing I really despise is taking the train back home

120
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
At the end of the day

121
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Usually I'll, in fact, I'll take a car because I just can't stand

122
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,520
All these drunks sitting on the train, bothering you

123
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,520
Making noises, you know

124
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,520
It's just like it's irritating

125
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
Absolutely, now is it enforceable?

126
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
I think that's highly unlikely

127
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
I have no idea

128
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,520
I have no idea how they're going to enforce that

129
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,520
The last thing you want to do is tell a Brit

130
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Who's had a couple of drinks that he has to put his beer away

131
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,520
Okay, add to something you just don't want to participate in

132
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Hey, and this is David from St. Carlos California

133
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
Quick question for you

134
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,520
This is the second day in real one

135
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,520
I download the daily source code right by iTunes

136
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
Downloads it for me automatically

137
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
I get two episodes

138
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
The same two episodes actually

139
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,520
One couple of times, and the other doesn't

140
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
What's up with that?

141
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
Is that a taking a system?

142
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Thanks man

143
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,520
You know, this is something that's pretty irritating

144
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,520
A couple of people have emailed me about this

145
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,520
And I've seen reports around around the net

146
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,520
And of course, this is obviously directly related to our name

147
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,520
Change to mevio.com in the US

148
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,520
By the way, for those of you wondering

149
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,520
It will remain BT Podshow in the UK

150
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,520
There's a different vibe about Podcasting in the UK

151
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Thanks to the BBC, they understand

152
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,520
It's not amateurs in basements with microphones

153
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,520
But some good crapman

154
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Anyway, it relates to that

155
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,520
And I believe it's the way that iTunes handles

156
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
Your RSS feed

157
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
It's kind of a technical discussion

158
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,520
But there's such a thing called

159
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
Is the global unique identifier

160
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,520
The GUID

161
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,520
And regardless of what URL is attached

162
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,520
And in fact, interestingly enough

163
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,520
I believe the URL sometimes is the global unique identifier

164
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,520
You should never, once that GUID has been seen

165
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,520
Which is a part of the episode

166
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,520
It should never be downloaded again

167
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,520
And we've seen this problem from time to time

168
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
And unsubscribing doesn't help

169
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
It doesn't happen with every single show

170
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
For some mysterious reason

171
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,520
Another thing that I don't understand

172
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,520
So you could be getting shows twice

173
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
What I don't understand though

174
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
Hopefully this is not recent episodes

175
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
It sounded like it was

176
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,520
That makes no sense

177
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,520
There's no reason why you should be getting two copies of the show

178
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,520
Although of course, it is double the pleasure

179
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
And twice is nice

180
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,520
So I'll talk to Andrew Grumman again

181
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,520
He's the guy who knows the most about this

182
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,520
I think juice also had that problem

183
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
Not juice, but juice

184
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,520
Formally known as iPod or lemon

185
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,520
Also had some issues that early on

186
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
So thank you for the reports

187
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,520
Keep them coming in and I'll keep my eye on what's going on

188
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,520

189
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,520

245
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Even the Lord, yeah

246
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,520
So you got to hear my life

247
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,520
And don't break his sight, baby

248
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,520
And don't break his sight, baby

249
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,520
And don't break his sight, baby

250
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,520
And don't break his sight, baby

251
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Go to the Father

252
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,520
Go to the Father

253
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,520
Go to the Father

254
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,520
Go to the Father

255
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Go to the Father

256
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,520
Don't break his sight, baby

257
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,520
Go to the Father

258
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,520
Go to the Father

259
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,520
Go to the Father

260
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,520
Yeah, now there's a concept

261
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,520
Legalize it and I will advertise it

262
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
That's right

263
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,520
It's that simple, it's so crazy man that this plant is being outlawed

264
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Even further

265
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:17,520
When I read in the newspaper that the drug companies who are extremely worried about their patents expiring in the next three to five years

266
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,520
They're now going back to all kinds of natural plants trying to extract remedies

267
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Oh my goodness, do the research

268
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,520
Hey, by the way, I've never met a guy who was stoned on the train who bothered me

269
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,520
I wonder what Boris Johnson asked to say on the matter

270
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,520
We'll certainly have to ask him if possible

271
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
I'm a little anxious right now

272
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,520
My daughter in right now in the UK here at the Curry Manor

273
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,520
It is 8 minutes past 4 in the afternoon at 4.24

274
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
My daughter takes her driving test and she's nervous

275
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,520
I went driving with her yesterday for about an hour

276
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,520
She's pretty good, you know, all things considered

277
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Again, I've had the luxury of having to learn a skill similar to that

278
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,520
Not too long ago because of course when you think back to your own learning how to drive period

279
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,520
And actually when you got your license, if you've been driving for a while

280
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,520
Aren't you thinking to yourself, man, I drove for crap back then

281
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Now I know a little bit more about what's going on

282
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,520
So I had the same experience of course learning how to fly helicopters

283
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Then fixed-wing airplane, so I'm a little more laid back than most probably

284
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,520
And understand that the license to drive is kind of a license to learn how to drive

285
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,520
Of course, it's definitely frightening when you're on your own child

286
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,520
It's about to get on to the severely congested highways, highways, motorways

287
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,520
And with all the other idiots out there, which of course is what she has no knowledge of

288
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
That only comes with experience

289
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,520
Of course, a beautiful young woman in a snappy little car

290
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Anyway, so I sent out the good vibes, my friends

291
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:04,520
She was definitely nervous about it and she's like, but for 30, it'll be rush hour and I was like, you know, dude

292
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Just approach

293
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,520
Approach this driving test, the way you would Facebook, you know how you navigate Facebook and how you're fingers fly over the keyboard

294
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,520
And how you're in complete control and command, so you being controlled and command of what you're doing

295
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,520
Don't worry about little mistakes, just work your way through traffic other people making mistakes

296
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,520
I'm just really hoping she does okay, she would be so, so disappointed

297
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,520
So I have to I have to be done by I can only do another 30 minutes because when she calls, I have to be prepared for whatever is coming

298
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,520
So perfect timing, I would say to roll out

299
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
You know, well, that's his time

300
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
I'm counting casting

301
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,520
I'm hearing this, this is the head test

302
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,520

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
Body heat maybe

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,520
And that concludes hit this number 100 and 21

354
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
So I'm on and she did this

355
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
Well, John the first two of course are pretty easy

356
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
The third one I had a little mix up there

357
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,960
makes up there. I think as you get a quarter star for the least.

358
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,320
Like always, hittest.mevio.com is the place to find info about the hittest answers.

359
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,360
And of course, the iTunes links if you want to buy tracks featured on the hittest online.

360
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,320
Adam, thank you for playing again.

361
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,480
Everyone else, thank you for listening. Next week I'll be back for another hittest.

362
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,080
So until then, F1, take care and remember to try to think with your heart. Bye-bye.

363
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:44,520
Your Honor, please don't bang that gavel. You can try this cowbell out.

364
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,520
Let's all give a nod. To the harnessed work and lawyer,

365
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:56,520
He's Jersey tight in bed. He's Jersey tight in bed.

366
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:04,520
Oh yeah. Your Honor, what do you say? He might even fit with his case.

367
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:16,360
Yo, don't call to come back. How's it going, Adam? It's Jersey tight. The official music

368
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:22,440
kind of just of the chacha, except no substitutes. So hey, I know I've been away for a little bit

369
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,880
then real busy in the personal life. Things are good. Things are good. Hey, while I was away

370
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,840
the billboard article came out. I got to be honest. I was a little little annoyed that

371
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,680
my shining face wasn't pictured in the article. But hey, what you're going to do. Who was

372
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:47,560
featured in the article, along with Mr. Curry, was the other J.T. John Tagliari. Jersey's own,

373
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,400
the other J.T. And damn it, Adam, you can't just share a page and billboard magazine without playing

374
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,040
the guy. In fact, I went through his site on the potsafe music network and noticed that you've never

375
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:05,880
played J.T. This is indeed a mistake. John Tagliari has a wonderful, wonderful album and I'm

376
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:12,360
strongly encouraging everybody to check it out. Right now, this is Leap of Faith on the Daily Source Code.

377
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:39,720
To me, I'm trying to hold to these everyone else. I always put it myself as I'm trying to hold

378
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:47,800
to feel what they're feeling. I'm trying to hold to make it less but made that's what they're

379
00:23:47,800 --> 00:24:02,040
calling for me. I feel so free now. I need no one you hold me down again. I'll leave of faith.

380
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:20,680
Well, look back at what I've done. Give up anything worth learning there. Only know it's time to have fun.

381
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:31,560
It's time to live without having a care. I do really, there's all heavy in there to this middle

382
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:40,680
fairy tale plan. Now I know I'll break it for a minute. I'm going to give it all I care

383
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:50,680
about. Now I know I'll break it for a minute. I'll break it for a minute. I'll break it for a minute.

384
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:36,680
You know, knock down the doors and throw out the roof of us. Nobody's coming for me now.

385
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:46,680
I'll hold my head higher and higher. I'm going to take my stand out and leave of faith. That's what they call it.

386
00:25:46,680 --> 00:26:02,680
I'll leave of faith. No one you hold me down again. I'll leave of faith. That's what they call it.

387
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:16,680
I'll leave of faith. I'll feel so free now. I'll leave of faith. No one you hold me down again. I'll leave of faith.

388
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:24,680
There is nothing like the top-down driving around Jersey Sound, John Tagley here in a leap of faith.

389
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:30,680
Exportly introed by our very own Sir Jersey Todd, the official music college just up the shot shot.

390
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:36,680
Back on the footballer Fridays. I think I actually have played JT before Jersey Todd.

391
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:42,680
Somehow the reporting must have gotten messed up. I'm pretty sure I've heard the song before.

392
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:50,680
Hey, big topic. It's all of a sudden just blown up here. He's about nuclear energy.

393
00:26:50,680 --> 00:27:02,680
I'm not one to just take what's written in newspaper as the gospel. I certainly believe there's been a structural campaign against nuclear energy for at least two or three decades.

394
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:08,680
There's a lot of misinformation out there. The whole nuclear atomic thing scares people.

395
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:16,680
There's a lot of information, perhaps misinformation about what the waste is.

396
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:28,680
Most of us think nuclear waste involves vats of green ooze. Nothing could be further from the truth. They're nicely stackable blue glowing cubes.

397
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:36,680
They are highly radioactive, but you can store them in places, and that of course is what it's all about. What do you do with the waste?

398
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:46,680
Well, I'm learning a lot about this. The first thing my belief is that he even have a discussion. We have to remove a lot of these preconceived notions.

399
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:59,680
I have to re-brand nuclear energy. It's just the wrong name. I've been working on names. I came up with moon juice, thinking that wouldn't be an interesting idea to put all the nuclear waste up on the moon.

400
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:06,680
I think it's doable. I think there's plenty of space up there. Wouldn't it be cool if the moon was glowing blue? Wouldn't that just be awesome?

401
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:11,680
So we could call it moon juice, and your life would be powered by the moon.

402
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,680
Well, you can imagine this insanity has brought on some commentary.

403
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:22,680
Hello, Adam. Go, man. They are not Bristol. We're naming all re-branding nuclear energy.

404
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,680
Well, I don't just fucking call it magic moon beams or pixie dust. I don't think that's easy.

405
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,680
People know what the thing is.

406
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,680
Magic moon beams would have to be there if you call it.

407
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:42,680
It's politically correct. Also, what a fucking BT pod show.

408
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
Are we going to get BT media?

409
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
I already answered that question.

410
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Yeah, magic moon beams. I like that, man. That sounds even better to me.

411
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Hey, sorry. Ross and Washington. One problem was sending nuclear byproducts to the moon.

412
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,680
We had some good ideas on the drawing board.

413
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,680
Morphs specific DT polygenic elements into the sun.

414
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,680
And nobody wants to do it because there aren't ones fearing of a dirty bombson area.

415
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Where is the rocket blows up or there's airs to attack?

416
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,680
And all the waste is viewed across a large area.

417
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,680
And yes, not a good scenario.

418
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:26,680
Now, what we can do with it, well, the problem is we have.

419
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,680
What a thing.

420
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:34,680
All right, I think we should stop because there's someone the authorities are listening in.

421
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,680
Yeah, that is a point.

422
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,680
You want to make sure that space travel is a little safer than it is.

423
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,680
But then again, I'm sure that there's a waste, no, maybe not.

424
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
I don't know.

425
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,680
Well, then there's the option, of course, of looking at another heavenly body.

426
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,680
Hey, Adam, you don't shoot the nuclear waste to the moon.

427
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,680
You shoot it into the sun and you refuel it. It's all good.

428
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,680
Bye.

429
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,680
All right, all right.

430
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,680
So magic moon beams may not be a viable idea.

431
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,680
But of course, there is one savant out there who absolutely knows what's going on.

432
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,680
And he's done an interesting thing.

433
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,680
I want you to listen to this.

434
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,680
Here's our buddy.

435
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,680
All right, nuclear soma, atomic rod atoms.

436
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Adam, atomic rod here.

437
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Been appreciating all your commentary about rebranding atomic fish and you and your other listeners

438
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,680
have brought lots of questions that need a little bit more than a minute and a half response.

439
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,680
So what I did was put together an answer show.

440
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,680
You can find it at the atomic show.

441
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,680
URL is atomic.podcastnetwork.com.

442
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,680
And there I answer some of your questions about waste countries that produce uranium.

443
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,680
What we should call nuclear power,

444
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:53,680
how atomic fishing can help us answer the challenges of oil depletion, greenhouse gas emissions,

445
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,680
and the economic power of the oil producing countries.

446
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,680
The show is about 23 minutes long.

447
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,680
So it's way past my minute and a half time limit on your show.

448
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,680
48 two adult daughters with great careers.

449
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,680
One lovely wife of 27 years ever said to five plus for solo.

450
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,680
Great hair.

451
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,680
Hope you win.

452
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,680
Love you.

453
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,680
I mean it.

454
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,680
Protect your freedom with passion.

455
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
Yeah, atomic rod atoms.

456
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Everybody.

457
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
And you should listen to that show.

458
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,680
I'll put a link in the show notes at dailysourceco.com.

459
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
I listened to it this morning while I was prepping.

460
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
It's about twenty twenty five minutes.

461
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,680
Oh, it is four twenty four.

462
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
One second.

463
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Sending out good vibes to my daughter.

464
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Come on, baby.

465
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,680
Come on, you can do it.

466
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Don't be worried.

467
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,680
Okay.

468
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,680
That would you all please just put your hands on your iPod and think along with the pod daughter.

469
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,680
She needs it.

470
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,680
So listen to this answer show.

471
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
There's a lot of good information in there.

472
00:31:53,680 --> 00:32:00,680
And I continue my quest to understand exactly what the pros and cons are of of of of of moon beams of

473
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,680
moon moon juice.

474
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,680
Crap.

475
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,680
You know what I'm talking about.

476
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,680
Don't you?

477
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,680
Hi.

478
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,680
This is How Witson from The Young Pants FM podcast.

479
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Best of you, actually music.

480
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,680
Can't you live under bridging limbs?

481
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
We may house music.

482
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
I can't break it.

483
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,680
I can't think you like it.

484
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,680
On this month's episode, we're delighted to have in the studio since pop legends.

485
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,680
Howard Jones.

486
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Now, Howard may be one of the most influential people in history of electronic music.

487
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Please also not very good doing radio announcements.

488
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
It turns out.

489
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,680
Let's see what happens when we try to get him to do this podcast for a month.

490
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,680
Hello, this is Howard Jones.

491
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,680
I just want to tell you that I'm going to be.

492
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
I know.

493
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
Oh, this is Howard Jones.

494
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,680
I'm very happy to tell you that I'm going to be involved with the Young Pants FM podcast.

495
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,680
And we're going to be talking about things from the year.

496
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,680
This is rubbish.

497
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,680
I've got no improvisational skills whatsoever.

498
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,680
Okay, this is the real one.

499
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,680
Hi, this is Howard Jones.

500
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,680
And check out the Young Pants FM podcast.

501
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:18,680

This is the Daily Source Podcast.

507
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,680
The Daily Source Podcast.

508
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,680
Hey.

509
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,680
Oh man, get ready for another mind fun.

510
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Sing along if you can.

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
It's going to blow your mind.

867
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
It's going to blow your mind.

868
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,680
It's going to blow your mind.

869
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,680
It's going to blow your mind.

870
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,680
It's going to blow your mind.

871
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,680
It's going to blow your mind.

872
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
It's going to blow your mind.

873
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,680
It's going to blow your mind.

874
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
It's going to blow your mind.

875
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,680
It's going to blow your mind.

876
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,680
It's going to blow your mind.

877
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,680
It's going to blow your mind.

878
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,680
It's going to blow your mind.

879
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,680
It's going to blow your mind.

880
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
It's going to blow your mind.

881
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,680
It's going to blow your mind.

882
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,680
It's going to blow your mind.

883
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,680
It's going to blow your mind.

884
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,680
It's going to blow your mind.

885
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,680
It's going to blow your mind.

886
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,680
That's hot.

887
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,680
That's going to raise my prostate cancer prevention quotient by at least one before the end

888
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,680
of the show.

889
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
Just thinking about the accelerometer.

890
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,680
I was going through Heathrow, Tamil Nadu Five.

891
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,680
You know what happened?

892
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:56,680
Toilets in Tamil Nadu Five don't have toilet paper rolls.

893
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,680
But there's a tiny tissues.

894
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,680
So BA or BA are trying to convert folders to scrunchers.

895
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
No.

896
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,680
You.

897
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,680
That indeed is truly an outrage.

898
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,680
Come extra blogger.

899
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,680
Well, hopefully I never have to go through Terminal Five.

900
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,680
But now you know, bring your own TP if you're a folder.

901
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,680
The world has gone crazy, my friends.

902
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,680
We're all hating each other on the inner waves.

903
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,680
And you can't wipe your ass in Terminal Five.

904
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,680
John Campbell, John, tell me all about it.

905
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,680
The world is crazy, my friends.

906
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,680
Like it's always been on.

907
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,680
Make you want a life cry little die.

908
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,680
Fly high, as wide as I can breathe.

909
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,680
Because of the remains cost a million never a minute.

910
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:58,680
We're all hating each other on the inner waves.

911
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:05,680
Like it's always been on.

912
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:13,680
The world is crazy, my friends.

913
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,680
Make you want a life cry little die.

914
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,680
Fly high, as wide as I can breathe.

915
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,680
Fly high, as wide as I can breathe.

916
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,680
You and children, the name of your God,

917
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,680
can never be controlled as a sin.

918
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,680
Because the world has crazy, my friends.

919
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,680
Like it's always been on.

920
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:56,680
The world is crazy, my friends.

921
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:07,680
Like it's always been on.

922
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,680
The world is crazy, baby

923
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,680
Like it's always been

924
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,680
Think you want a life cry

925
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,680
Little dive, fly high

926
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,680
As wide as I am

927
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,680
They pay a man with a shovel

928
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,680
To go underneath the ground

929
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,680
Last and a man with a pair

930
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,680
The world is crazy, baby

931
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,680
Like it's always been

932
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,680
Think you want a life cry

933
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,680
Little dive, fly high

934
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,680
As wide as I am

935
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,680
They pay a man with a shovel

936
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,680
To go underneath the ground

937
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,680
Last and a man with a shovel

938
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,680
To go underneath the ground

939
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,680
Because the world is crazy, baby

940
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,680
Like it's always been

941
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,680
Think you want a life cry

942
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,680
Little dive, fly high

943
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,680
As wide as I am

944
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,680
They pay a man with a shovel

945
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,680
To go underneath the ground

946
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,680
Last and a man with a shovel

947
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,680
The world is crazy, baby

948
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,680
Like it's always been

949
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,680
Think you want a life cry

950
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,680
Little dive, fly high

951
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,680
As wide as I am

952
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,680
They pay a man with a shovel

953
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,680
To go underneath the ground

954
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,680
Because the world is crazy, baby

955
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,680
Like it's always been

956
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,680
Think you want a life cry

957
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,680
Little bit of change

958
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,680
Though the world is crazy

959
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,680
Like it's always been

960
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,680
But

961
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,680
And that

962
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,680
This inner web shit is brand new

963
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,680
We're still got the training wheels on

964
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,680
But how to use it

965
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,680
John Campbell John

966
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,680
I was dropped off

967
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,680
For the daily source code

968
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,680
Drop, you can find it in the show

969
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,680
Notes, drop.ail, slash

970
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,680
Daily, source code

971
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,680
Which was down actually earlier this morning

972
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,680
I think they've upgraded something

973
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,680
So it's working again

974
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,680
Go ahead and drop some stuff there

975
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,680
If you feel like

976
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,680
It's Friday

977
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,680
My day Tuesday

978
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,680
Wednesday Thursday

979
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,680
Food about Friday

980
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,680
I have a final fun

981
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,680
Your phone to read

982
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,680
Okay, so my almost final thought

983
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,680
As I hope my daughter gets her driver's license

984
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,680
That would be nice

985
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,680
But thinking about

986
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,680
The inner webs

987
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,680
I think we need a little more investigation

988
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,680
Into PR firms and public relations

989
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,680
Proplicity and press in general

990
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,680
Because my feeling is

991
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,680
We're being gained, we're being played

992
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,680
Next time you see an article

993
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,680
Don't just copy it

994
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,680
And repost it on your weblog

995
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,680
Think about it

996
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,680
For a second

997
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,680
Is it really true?

998
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,680
Have you been interviewed for anything

999
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,680
And was everything you said

1000
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,680
Representing the article

1001
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,680
That it seemed absolutely the truth

1002
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,680
The way you thought it happened

1003
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,680
Well, of course not

1004
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,680
And take it from me

1005
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,680
So my thinking is

1006
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,680
We're being played

1007
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,680
On some

1008
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,680
I'm going to start looking into this

1009
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,680
Because it seems like

1010
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,680
Just like the reports now

1011
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,680
Coming in from China

1012
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,680
With all this huge anti-western sentiment

1013
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,680
You know like

1014
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,680
Dude, are we trying to help these guys out?

1015
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,680
I thought we were

1016
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,680
So clearly something is a rye

1017
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,680
And we must look into this

1018
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,680
So let's do that

1019
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,680
And I think that the final thought of the week

1020
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,680
Because you've got to be happy

1021
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,680
You've got your freedom

1022
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,680
But do you really

1023
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,680
Are you jacked into the machine

1024
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,680
Are you believe in everything

1025
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,680
The man is now

1026
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,680
Pushing into your brain

1027
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,680
Through those pipes

1028
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,680
24-7

1029
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,680
Through Twitter

1030
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,680
Through email

1031
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,680
Through RSS

1032
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,680
Do you really know

1033
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,680
Or all this information is coming from

1034
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,680
Think about that over the week

1035
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,680
In my friends

1036
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,680
Because that is my final thought of the week

1037
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,680
Until Monday

1038
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,680
Live your life with passion

1039
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,680
And enjoy your freedom

1040
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,680
Another fine

1041
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,680
Media presentation

1042
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,680
Stick it in your ear
