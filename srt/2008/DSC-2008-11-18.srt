00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Shere Charly, 8-0-5

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
$60 billion worth of airplanes trapped by us

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
To the next generation radio content in my ears

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We don't need lots of digging trees

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm casting his allegory

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A long distance, direct me assistance

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And I'll control you

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To say, hey, Moses, Mr. Millewon

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He said hello with me on hold

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Said he's the cat who has come to sit

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
To call us, child who call you

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I think I'm outnumbered

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I've seen that guy in the world

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
To call us

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
To call us

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
To call us

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
To call us

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
To call us

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
To call us

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm extremely firm a friend of a pre-U

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Said he's the truth with you

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
To meet your loving stator

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You just have to do

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,840
Hey, I said

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,000
To you relate to a Cat attract him

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And he know the bank for funds in the new

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He said lol

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't call us To help him

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Call you

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
All you boys

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, it's a slacker, jump on the door

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We went, we cut a heat, I'm gonna try to be it

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
With the sun, we said it could be you

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And then we pulled the legs and the shoulders

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
To the upper end of the street

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We got the signature coins and lousy joins

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And all the glitter we can use

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
My myself, who called us, that will call you

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We got the signature coins and lousy joins

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We made it just more than we thought

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So listen, can you pay more than call

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And we went, that will be all for all

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We got the signature coins and lousy joins

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We got the signature coins and lousy joins

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So it's my become the new mantra for our politicians

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't call us, we'll call you

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Three, two, one, two, one, two, three

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You can count on it

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Coming you on all of it

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Everybody, hi, do, then he chose code

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Episode eight, zero five we've got

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Australia, Energy and Corridor

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Obama, the officer of the president

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
elect the bail out of the economy

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Deadly vaccines and of course the climate

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What else do you expect after I haven't been, uh, been with you for, uh, what is it now?

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Uh, what was the last time we had to show? Like Tuesday, Wednesday, uh, crap.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It is Tuesday here in the United Kingdom. It's the 18th of November, 2008, everybody.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It is, uh, daily source code. I've been rummaging through the source code drop for the past.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
At least the past two hours. Um, I think I went back as far as nine pages, so I wouldn't miss a single song, a single link, a single YouTube video.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I could actually spend most of my day going, just keeping up with the stuff you guys are posting.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's outrageous, but a fantastic companion to this program.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So a little update. Let's see what's going on.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Of course, I was in New York for a week.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Uh, I had hope that I would be able to eat out another show, at least make a two show week last week, didn't happen.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Um, most of the day was spent, um, up and down, Madison Avenue.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And a couple other spots, not all advertising in New York isn't just an unmatis nav,

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
but obviously, in fact, very little of it is these days.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It seems as that business has changed towards media buying agencies, having all the money and the creative agencies having none of the money.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But I have to say, very positive.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Um, we've got to some new sales guys.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Uh, we were in New York with, um, my partner and co-founder Ron Bloom, uh, who is now chairman of me,

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
uh, Jeff Carp, Jeff Carp is our brand new CEO.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't even think we've done a press release about this yet.

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We've been just so incredibly busy.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This guy came in from electronic arts and he's been going full steam with us, uh,

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
since the minute he put foot in the door.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Uh, when I'm planning on doing his interviewing him for the source code.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And, uh, so you can get to know him a little bit better.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Because I do spend a lot of my time there.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And if you're, you know, if you're like me, I guess,

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
that I haven't been able to do as many shows as I'd like to recently.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Then, uh, this guy's, uh, partially to blame.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
At least he, he knows, uh, he knows a lot of things that, uh, that I don't.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And he's going to be a real, uh, real asset to the organization.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Uh, so, uh, that kind of wraps up the, uh, the past almost eight weeks on the road.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Um, spend, you know, going back and forth from time to time.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But essentially spent in San Francisco, Los Angeles in New York.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And now, of course, with six weeks left until we have to be out of here,

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
we've, uh, got this place checked off the list and the new one,

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
which I don't even have a name for yet.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm thinking of, uh, maybe the curry terrace,

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
since it's, uh, a terrace house.

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
As we're moving into the actual city away from the affluent suburb of Surrey,

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
known as Gilford.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And I'm very excited about it, which, you know, of course it means another reboot.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We can go through these periodically.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Um, and in the next six weeks,

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I have to essentially decide what I'm going to keep and what I'm going to toss out.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And tomorrow, Patricia and I are going to the, um,

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
uh, to the storage place.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
When we moved to the UK, we had tons and tons of storage.

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I pay rent for my shit.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Or I'm sorry.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's called stuff.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Someone else might view it as shit.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Uh, so we're going to have to, I mean, we got to bite the bullet.

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I mean, I, I really, I haven't, I had this conversation with Patricia yesterday.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So I have all this stuff, which, of course, she calls shit.

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And a lot of it is, you know, um, ranging from, you know, my, my first laptops and computers.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I mean, not all of it.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Obviously, but, you know, I, I like to carry stuff around some papers, some books, some documents.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You know, things that I would think would, if I had the Adam Curry library,

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
it would be of values, uh, someday.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And Patricia says, no, no, don't get the shit.

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Don't care about your stuff or your shit.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Just throw it out.

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And she's probably right.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I mean, I've lived without it for four years.

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I haven't looked at it once.

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So, you know, what I don't know about.

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I, I guess I can't really miss, but I know I'm going to go through these boxes.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm going to see stuff.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm going to be like, oh, it hurts so much.

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So what I am going to do is I'm going to minimize on equipment.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I have so much equipment that I've assembled here in the attic.

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And essentially, I'm using very little of it.

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I always want to have all the right wires and plugs and

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
processors and compressors and whatever it is for any project that might pop up.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But honestly, I mean, I've really, we have one small Patricia will come up with an idea and

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
that I'll need to rewire stuff.

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But I'm, I'm really rethinking the whole office, rethinking the way I want to do it.

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I want to go very minimalist on the actual production stuff.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm going to finally get a proper 18 inch rack.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm going to install the stuff that I absolutely want to have available in that rack.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And then it's just going to be monitors wall to wall.

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm running all kinds of cool stuff.

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But this is going to be a lot of work over the next six, six weeks.

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Patricia, of course, is still working on her show pop stars in an Netherlands.

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So, you know, that means it's going to come down to me.

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Me and the teenager, the 18 year old, we'll see how much she wants to help out.

143
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But it's exciting.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And I guess we'll just document some of that along the way.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I mean, think about it.

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
All this, all this nasty shit that I have to get into,

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
like setting up the postal mail forward.

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You know, new banking office.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
All of the, just so many changes telephone internet,

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
although I do have to get my order for virgin media in ASAP.

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I want some of that badass cable bandwidth.

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm going to get DSL.

153
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm going to get cable.

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm going to get everything I can.

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Because I'm so, so tired of the, you know,

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
literally the 1.1 megabit down,

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
300 kilobit upload that I've had to deal with for the past two years.

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And this particular location, finally getting into London,

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
should give me some actual,

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
yeah, actual throughput, which will be how it may not be nice.

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And I want to set up a green screen in the new studio.

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's going to be cool.

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I got the ground floor right next to the kitchen.

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You know, it's, it's, I'm very excited.

165
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It really is, it's going to be awesome.

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's just that moving thing.

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That, that doesn't excite me at all.

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So, let's see.

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
As I said earlier, today we're going to handle a lot of different topics.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
There's no way I can make a short show out of it.

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There's just too much to talk about and too much to highlight.

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Too much stuff coming out in real mainstream news.

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It is different than most people believe,

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and we're just sitting around like sheep will not do

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
in a single thing about it.

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So, time to kick some cans.

178
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Hi Adam, it's Matt from Gamesweasel.

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
With the recession kicking in and everyone's staying at home.

180
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What better past time to keep you entertained than playing video games?

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So, this week I'll give you role playing game Fallout 3.

182
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Swing into action with Spider-Man Web of Shadows.

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The brand new Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe comic book based around the game.

184
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And you come in copies of XEDS for the DS.

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's all it gamesweasel.com.

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Before I forget, we have a new sponsor across the media network,

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
which is this thing called Rovio.

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't know if you've seen it yet.

189
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Actually, one is in my name at the San Francisco office,

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
but it's been captured and has been taken down

191
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
for doing daily segments or, you know,

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
they're actually using it in video production.

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This Rovio is a four-wheeled robotic device

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
that has a webcam microphone and speaker built into it.

195
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You can control and Wi-Fi.

196
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You can control it from anywhere in the world through the web interface.

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And I believe that I also have an Apple iPhone

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
or iPod Touch applications.

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So, you can also essentially remote control this

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
from wherever you are in the world as long as you have a net access.

201
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And you can talk to people on the other end.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You can hear what they're saying.

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You can, you know, you'll see the picture of where it's driving

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
through the webcam.

205
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This thing is absolutely stunning.

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's only a couple hundred bucks.

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And I want you to, if you're interested in this,

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
go to the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Crossposts at acccurry.com.

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And check out one of the segments.

211
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I think Nick did down in the basement studios

212
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
in San Francisco headquarters of the Rovio.

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I believe the website is meetrovio.com.

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's a fantastic device.

215
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I mean, mainly jealous that I have not received mine here in the UK,

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
because boy, I got some ideas on how to play with that puppy.

217
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So, in the show, it's check out that video.

218
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You will not be disappointed.

219
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Okay, a couple things I'm selected under the header of they.

220
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
As in they, they don't like it.

221
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
They are doing this.

222
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
They work for us.

223
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
A couple of people started sending me stuff about

224
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
the social worker system where the child protection system,

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I should say, actually.

226
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And of course, we've discussed a little bit about how my previous radio show

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
in the Netherlands was abruptly canceled.

228
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Coincidentally, after I started to unearth some of the highest people in the

229
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
justice system throughout the Benalox being involved in,

230
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I have to say, allegedly being involved in a child pornography.

231
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And so, you know, I think this is pretty rampant.

232
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, I know what I forgot to look up.

233
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Something came out earlier today.

234
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Let me see.

235
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Let me see if I can find it.

236
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This is about the Isle of Jersey.

237
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, man.

238
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Isle of Jersey.

239
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
All of a sudden, this is so funny.

240
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Shit, I don't have that link.

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
All of a sudden, there was reporting that, oh, there were no children

242
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
tortured, no sex taking place with, with minors.

243
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That bunker down there, those bones.

244
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
No, those are just animal bones.

245
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's not any, no, no human remains down there.

246
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
After they replaced the chief of police, you know, judges been switched around.

247
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And I literally get email from people saying, hey, you've got to correct yourself.

248
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It says right here in the news that it's not true.

249
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh, please, please, please, please, please, please.

250
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
This one comes from the Daily Mail.

251
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Now, you know me, I've got nothing against porn.

252
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But when you read this, you got to be pretty concerned.

253
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Your senior social workers responsible for child protection are at the center of a computer

254
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
porn investigation.

255
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It is understood that the men all managers with dev in the social services.

256
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
This is here in the United Kingdom, of course.

257
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We're suspended last month over allegations of, quote,

258
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
inappropriate material on their office PCs.

259
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
None of the allegations has thought to involve illegal images,

260
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
but the police have not been called in.

261
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, of course, they haven't been called in.

262
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Why would they actually investigate their buddies, their friends?

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Demincounsel refused to name the men, which, of course,

264
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
whenever someone else is accused of illegal pornography,

265
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
they're immediately named in the newspaper.

266
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Demincounny Council said, we have suspended some staff while an investigation takes place.

267
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Internal investigation.

268
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Of course, no police, no law enforcement called in.

269
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
This is the stuff that is running rampant throughout our society everywhere.

270
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Even the Lima-Nata man called in from the Netherlands,

271
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
he's pretty pertubed about this kind of thing.

272
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I was kind of angry on you for not being straightforward about the true reason

273
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
your radio show was discontinued.

274
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
As I was convinced that the only real reason you had to leave,

275
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
arrow was misademic.

276
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Well, so now you know, but it wasn't directly that way.

277
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It always goes through finance years,

278
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
and the money supply gets cut off if you don't shut up.

279
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And so I decided to keep the honor to myself.

280
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And I said, that's all right.

281
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You don't want me to do a show like this,

282
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
even though you asked me to do exactly this,

283
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
then I'll just stop in the story.

284
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's remarkable the only party's who questioned on him

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and has representatives who were young math and later we'll listen.

286
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So what he's talking about now is Dutch politicians.

287
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This is about the Secretary General of Justice in the Netherlands,

288
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
who is deeply involved and is not being investigated

289
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
at all and is being protected.

290
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
They both now hold the record for the quickest ever answer questions

291
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
and at least media exposure.

292
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Well, in the media, well, this is being ridiculous.

293
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Almost every single thing he says, he now got no attention.

294
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Well, as usual, his discretion seriously matters.

295
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So this is a politician who is perceived to be right,

296
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
very right-wing, builders, and he's calling this stuff out.

297
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And of course, when you tell the truth the first thing that happens

298
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
you get ridiculed.

299
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You're a cook.

300
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You're not job.

301
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You're a wacky sound familiar?

302
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The best end episodes of the DSC.

303
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I had kind of shorts, shorts, shorts, shorts,

304
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
or a shirt with in my mind.

305
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah, I can tell.

306
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
In the item, the story of your life,

307
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I hate your first birth crossing on national radio in the Netherlands.

308
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You were replacing Barcelona.

309
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
The next episode of this item told you were hanging out with the developer.

310
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The song Animal was played.

311
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's video clip was recorded in the very north of North Holland at Circus Holiday.

312
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Later that Circus became a mobile KGB office

313
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
with a couple of joints, but that are irrelevant anecdotes.

314
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah, I like it.

315
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's video clip of Animal.

316
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Showed Barton Lava, his partner.

317
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Any normalish alcoholic.

318
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Oh, I mean, this is interesting stuff.

319
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So now he's referring to Raymond soundtrack of your life,

320
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
where Raymond Ray on the Charlie has been,

321
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
had been, he kind of ran on a material,

322
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
but he was doing nice little historical pieces on my life.

323
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And so indeed, Def Lepard did their video,

324
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
the music video for Animal,

325
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
they recorded in the Vistlord Studios in Hilversum in the Netherlands.

326
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That's where they recorded their hysteria album.

327
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So the video clip in the Netherlands.

328
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And so now you're telling about the guy I replaced on the radio,

329
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
his partner.

330
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Was it known alcoholic?

331
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
This is new to me.

332
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Night after night, I was amazed how a person can control a car,

333
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
but so much alcohol.

334
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So one night, I took the shot conceit.

335
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Then I was told that in the days of the Veronica radio show

336
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
has for the cut, the killer of Andrea Lutter was hammered

337
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
with paranormal forces until he would confess.

338
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
They received a confession on their secret phone line.

339
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I was mentioning him.

340
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He had knowledge, which only the committee of the crime would know.

341
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Okay, I get it.

342
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So there was another radio, this is crazy.

343
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't know how, only people in the Netherlands really understand all this.

344
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I think with all these names, but anyway.

345
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So the guy that I replaced on the radio, he had a different radio show.

346
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It was like a paranormal kind of invite crazy people,

347
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
cookie people to speak to the dead.

348
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And so apparently they got a confession out of a guy

349
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
who committed a murder.

350
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And I guess it was an offense against a child.

351
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I presume.

352
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And I tried to file the confession, the confession.

353
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The police said, admitting a crime is not criminal,

354
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and therefore they could not file it.

355
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's amazing that you have a dead corpse,

356
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
forensic and all the infestigation teams on the case.

357
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
While the local police claims they have no case.

358
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Even when doing serious attempts on higher level,

359
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
there was no way to testify about this confession.

360
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And we never heard it in the media.

361
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Meanwhile, but from the other way, it's part of the diet,

362
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
of kind of the natural region.

363
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And I guess the other person who received this confession seems to be

364
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
to me, silence down.

365
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But if you think the media silence,

366
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
what do you think about all lawyers are being tapped by default?

367
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And on one single lawyer, they're to stand up and protest against that.

368
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's sick.

369
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And indeed, the next to be tapped by default,

370
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
where does you lose?

371
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Exactly.

372
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
If you have nothing to hide, you don't need to be afraid.

373
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So you're talking about phone tapped. Oh, yeah.

374
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Absolutely. Well, the Netherlands is the worst

375
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
because they have a professional judge system

376
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and they don't work with a jury, a trial jury.

377
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So the judge basically decides, and from time to time,

378
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
they put lawyers in as judges.

379
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's kind of a rotating system.

380
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
If you want a favorable outcome,

381
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
then what you need to do is you need to hire

382
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
the law firm of the judge that is presiding.

383
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And it's crazy the way that works.

384
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Sorry, yeah.

385
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So if you're point there,

386
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
limonata, if your point was that the whole system

387
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
is pretty much infiltrated with corrupt people,

388
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
then point well made and taken,

389
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
because that's exactly what it is.

390
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I mean, just consider that one out of every 100 people

391
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
is completely psychopathic.

392
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I mean, that's thinkable, right?

393
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
One percent, I think that makes sense.

394
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Now if they find each other,

395
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and one of them starts off decades ago

396
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
working in the justice system,

397
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
wherever you are on the total pull right down

398
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
to the feet on the street, the cops,

399
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
all the way up to the Secretary General of Justice,

400
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
the highest level of office.

401
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And if you don't think that this doesn't go

402
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
to royal families in certainly well documented

403
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Belgian royal family, Dutch royal family,

404
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
the British royal family, to the White House,

405
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
you should Google Lawrence King and George Bush.

406
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Senior.

407
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Now this is, this stuff is taking place

408
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and they're protecting each other

409
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
and I'm standing by it.

410
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Some some great secrecy going on.

411
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
This has been brought up on a couple of shows.

412
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The first time I heard about it,

413
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
was just before and during the last,

414
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
this week in tech that I did with John C. Dvorak,

415
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and I think we've talked about it

416
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and I know agenda as well.

417
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I put a link to this story about actor.

418
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
This is the, let me see with the acronym stands for,

419
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
the anti counterfitting trade agreement,

420
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
which is apparently pretty much worldwide,

421
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
although I believe it might exclude China,

422
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
it may be all about China.

423
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's the whole point is we don't know.

424
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Title of this article, EU Council refuses to release

425
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
secret actor documents.

426
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So the council of the European Union,

427
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
which, yeah, you can say that they are elected

428
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
because they're elected officials in their own countries,

429
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
but I didn't elect any of the other council members.

430
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
We only elect the one that represents your country.

431
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So it's kind of like a Starfleet command.

432
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And then our refusing to release secret anti counterfitting

433
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
trade agreement documents.

434
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh, this is from the freedom,

435
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
the free freedom information infrastructure,

436
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
which is a foundation.

437
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
They request these documents on the Freedom of Information Act,

438
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
of course, and they're not receiving it.

439
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And the question is why,

440
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
well, there's a couple of questions.

441
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Why are these being hidden?

442
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Does that not go against the entire grain of a democracy?

443
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And why is no one angry about it?

444
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Why are we not paying attention to these things?

445
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
We should be calling our ministers of parliament.

446
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
In Europe, call your minister of European,

447
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
you know, it's really easy.

448
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You can find their names, their email addresses, their phone numbers,

449
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and they do respond.

450
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And if you want me to call them up and put them on the spot,

451
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
not a problem, then tell me who you want me to call

452
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
and set it up and we'll do it.

453
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
We should be getting answers to this.

454
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I think I have to, now that probably not until the new year,

455
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
but when we roll into 2009,

456
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and we'll have more time during the day

457
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
to actually create shows.

458
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm just going to have to do it.

459
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I've got to put more people on the spot.

460
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
We've got to get answers because if anything,

461
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
the general populace is not doing it.

462
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
We're not calling anyone to the table and saying,

463
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
hey, this is bullshit.

464
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Now, of course, we're talking a lot more about stuff,

465
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
just like that as we move on to Australia

466
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and the bailout and the economy in general.

467
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But notable, notable.

468
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And I'm really confused about this,

469
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
mainly because of his position as a member of the Royal Family,

470
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Prince Charles, who just turned 60 the other day

471
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
and had there was a fantastic show on here

472
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
on television, kind of like a comedy variety show

473
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
to a celebrated 60th birthday,

474
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
which was hilarious.

475
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Robin Williams did a great set.

476
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I recorded it, so maybe I'll play a piece for you

477
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
in a future episode.

478
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But he keeps coming out saying all these things

479
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
that I really agreed with,

480
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
like genetically modified food is horrible.

481
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's going to kill us.

482
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I mean, these are the things he's literally saying.

483
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And now, I've put a link from,

484
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
what is this, the Guardian,

485
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
about critics who are now saying, hey,

486
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
this Prince Charles, he's got to be carefully

487
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
can't be saying too much stuff

488
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
because according to, I guess,

489
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Republican law, which I'm not quite sure

490
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
how that works over here,

491
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
once he's the monarch,

492
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
once he's the king,

493
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
which he, I don't know,

494
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
doesn't seem like that's any short-term plan still,

495
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
his mama's hanging in, just fine.

496
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Then he needs to shut up about all these issues.

497
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And I'm like, well, then don't let him become king

498
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
because the guy's actually saying

499
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
some pretty good stuff.

500
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
He's coming out against,

501
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
really against a lot of different issues

502
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and as far as I can tell,

503
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm totally on his side.

504
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Check this article out and give me some feedback

505
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
by leaving on the drop, which is drop.io slash daily source code.

506
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Because he's,

507
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
yeah, there's something about the guy that,

508
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
that I like.

509
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And please don't go suggesting I call him,

510
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
that might be a little bit difficult.

511
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Hold on.

512
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Although you never know,

513
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
he's the resources of the chucklehead.

514
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Just test.

515
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
This is hit that number of 147.

516
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Right on.

517
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And we're going to start right away

518
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
to show number one.

519
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Wow.

520
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It sounds weird,

521
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
but it's like,

522
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
some pop to my head is building a bridge to your heart.

523
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Two.

524
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Uh, that's, uh, Alice and Moye,

525
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
they all cried out.

526
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I think the first one,

527
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
wax, maybe building a bridge to your heart.

528
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I, I really couldn't catch the first one.

529
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
That was Alice and Moye,

530
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
they all cried out.

531
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
No, that for sure.

532
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And this is number three.

533
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Chuck,感,

534
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I feel for you just took a,

535
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
justМC,

536
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Chuck can,

537
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,400
Chuck can,

538
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,000
Chuck can't let me rush.

539
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm not too thin,

540
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
this week the answer for all from

541
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Pentagon.

542
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And this is answering number one.

543
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
This is Arcadia.

544
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Oh yeah.

545
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,500
A lucky day.

546
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:19,000
Wow!

547
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
That's a good one, y'all. Totally missed it.

548
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Also, not a big fan.

549
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Also, not a big fan.

550
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Durand Durand, well, sort of, Arcadia.

551
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
As answer number one.

552
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And this is answer number two.

553
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
This is Brian Farrow's shift, and a lot of them.

554
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Two down.

555
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Sounded just like it though, didn't it?

556
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Can't believe I got that one.

557
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Slave to love Brian Farrow's answer number two.

558
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And this is answer number three.

559
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I feel for you.

560
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
This is Shaka Khan.

561
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And this is answer number three.

562
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Shaka Khan, I feel for you.

563
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And this is a Bluetooth number one, four, seven.

564
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So, Adam.

565
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Yeah.

566
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
How did you do?

567
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Well, disappointing actually.

568
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I thought I would at least get the last two.

569
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'm going to messed up on Brian Farrow there.

570
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So, one out of three, that's two stars on a possible six.

571
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I stock young.

572
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Yeah, you should play to find the answers to this hit test.

573
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And then the older hit test, by the way.

574
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And also, the iTunes link, so you can buy the tricks.

575
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Featured in the hit test online is as always hittest.medio.com.

576
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Thanks for playing Adam.

577
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Thank you.

578
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Thank you for listening.

579
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Next week.

580
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I hope to be back for another hit test.

581
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So until then, have fun.

582
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Take care.

583
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And try to remember.

584
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Think with your heart.

585
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Bye-bye.

586
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
See back, hittest.medio.com.

587
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
info young.com.

588
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
J-A-N-P-O-L-D-T-A-S-G-O.

589
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Now, last week on the hittest, John mentioned that he had the new version of SoundBite,

590
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
which I used as a cart machine in my productions.

591
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And he said the new version had all these new features.

592
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And I checked to have the latest version.

593
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah, I'm not quite sure what the new features are.

594
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You know, if they baked a MIDI controller into that thing, yeah.

595
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Or at least the ability to read a MIDI controller to communicate with one,

596
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and that would be a big feature.

597
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So I'm not quite sure what the new features are.

598
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Damn.

599
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I was so convinced.

600
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Now, of course, I got to play Alice and Maria all all all cried out.

601
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'll play that on the upcoming episode.

602
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Maybe tomorrow, although Patricia's got me.

603
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
First, as I said, at the storage.

604
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And then after that, we have to go to IKEA because, you know,

605
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
she loves getting some of these articles,

606
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
which I usually wind up having to put together.

607
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That's exactly my favorite.

608
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
In the meantime, why don't we go head down under?

609
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
As we continue to talk about what's going on in Australia.

610
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Of course, the economic crisis has hit there as well.

611
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But a lot of interesting alternative energy coming out of Australia.

612
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And I'm quite excited about that.

613
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It is the impetus for me to really think about doing a trip down under in 2009.

614
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Probably I would want to do that.

615
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I guess when is it start to get colder?

616
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Does it get colder around July?

617
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Is that really when the winter sets in?

618
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Because I was there once.

619
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I can't remember if it was, maybe it was even earlier than that.

620
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Maybe it was April or May.

621
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And it got cold at night, man.

622
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It was like freezing.

623
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Of course, we were in the outback.

624
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And that's another thing that doesn't compute.

625
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You're sitting in a desert like dude.

626
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Why is it freezing?

627
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
To help me out.

628
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Chuckle heads down under.

629
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Let's really put something together here.

630
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And I want to hook up with people who are making these magnetic engines.

631
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And that's really what I want to do.

632
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So it's a big country.

633
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Help steer me in the right direction.

634
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And I'm noticing some other things we're talking about porn from down under,

635
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
which just kind of came up in passing conversation.

636
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It does happen from time to time on this show.

637
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And I'm seeing that there's a very interesting pornography culture in the land of Oz.

638
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Just looking at the, first of all, the lack of real Australian pornographic websites.

639
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I seem to be kind of getting the same three or four from everybody.

640
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But also, they really like their own natural vibe.

641
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And masturbation for some reason.

642
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Here's an email from Daas from Melbourne.

643
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Here's a bunch of Australian porn.

644
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Even if not much of it is made its way to you.

645
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I used to be a member of two of the following sites,

646
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
which is in large part all Australian content created by Australians,

647
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
even though they are marketed internationally.

648
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And really, so it's I feel myself dot com.

649
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I shot myself dot com, which is not of the, of the gun kind,

650
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
but of the photographic kind and beautiful agony, which is kind of funny.

651
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But it's, it's interesting.

652
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
That it's, um, the Australians like real people,

653
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
not fake pumped up boom porn stars doing real people things,

654
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
which in honesty don't look all that good on film.

655
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
They just, you know, it's just not a good look.

656
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
But that's what you guys are into.

657
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
That's, that to me is very interesting.

658
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah, moreover, it seems like a very natural,

659
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:27,000
human desire or desire, a culture of desire that is going on in Australia.

660
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And it's, uh, and check this out.

661
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You'll enjoy this.

662
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You know, now, of course, we're talking about the Australian government placing

663
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
filters at ISPs to filter out the bad pornography.

664
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Well, it's certainly not homegrown unless you guys are all down there,

665
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
but the guys and girls, I should say.

666
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Unless you're all vibing on US porn.

667
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Let me know.

668
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It seems like, uh, you know, just to be honest, you don't have to identify yourself.

669
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Would please leave a message on the drop of voicemail.

670
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
That's pretty simple.

671
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It shows you how to do it.

672
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Go to drop.io slash daily source code.

673
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Links are always in the show notes.

674
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And, uh, you have to call the number then type in the pin code.

675
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Leave a message or upload a MP3 file.

676
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I don't care how you do it.

677
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
As long as there's some sound, so we can share it with the whole community.

678
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And I don't wind up reading my whole inbox.

679
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Let me know.

680
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Are you watching Homegrown Australian porn?

681
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Are you watching Asian porn?

682
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Uh, let's figure this out.

683
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It certainly seems like you're not making any of the stuff that we typically see here,

684
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
or in the United States.

685
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Um, I've seen some British porn.

686
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Ah, man.

687
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yeah.

688
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I bet you the Brits really like their own, their own porn.

689
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Anyway, there's a sex party in Australia, and they're taking their sex very seriously.

690
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Let's listen to this video from, uh, over the past 20 years.

691
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
The sex party attitudes to sex and the sex industry.

692
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
This is Fiona Patton.

693
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
She's the Eros CEO and a Senate candidate in Australia.

694
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Open up enormously.

695
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Unfortunately, governments have not kept up with these changes.

696
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
They are still responding to pressure from minority religious groups and ignoring the rest of us.

697
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
We now have more censorship of adult entertainment.

698
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Then we did two decades ago.

699
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
If you've had enough of waozorism and political interference in your bedroom, help us make a change,

700
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
and join the Australian sex party.

701
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We're serious about sex.

702
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Right on.

703
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Good on you.

704
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
She's milky.

705
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Yeah.

706
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I'll endorse you.

707
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Hmm.

708
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I'm sure she sure there must be something else on the agenda of the sex party.

709
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Let's just take a look at the link here.

710
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Since we're all just kind of hanging out.

711
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Uh, six party dot org dot AU.

712
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Okay.

713
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'll gotta hate this bandwidth here.

714
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It sucks.

715
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
We're serious about sex.

716
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'll have basically the same message there.

717
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Okay.

718
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Our policies, sexual rights, freedom of sexual speech, gender balance,

719
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and outing sexual hypocrisy when we see it.

720
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Yeah, right on.

721
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Come on, man.

722
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Shouldn't we be allowed to stick anything we want in any office in our body at any time in the privacy of our own home?

723
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Shouldn't that be?

724
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Didn't that just be your own private shit?

725
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Or stuff?

726
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
If it's your, if it's yours, it's stuff.

727
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's stuff you're doing.

728
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
If you're doing it, it's shit you're doing.

729
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Uh.

730
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Interesting.

731
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
The beautiful Aggie and Agony dot com.

732
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You should look at that.

733
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It's pretty funny.

734
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Um, okay.

735
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So here's a comment from down under.

736
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Want to make sure I get that in.

737
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Hey Adam, it's full calling in from, uh,

738
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Is it in Australia?

739
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I feel compelled to call in after listening to a daily source.

740
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Uh, you're angry with three.

741
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm just trying to, it's global warming.

742
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Um, a couple of callers called in about it.

743
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You played some of their voicemails.

744
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yeah.

745
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Let me before you go on, though.

746
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The conversation as far as I'm concerned is no longer about.

747
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Climate change versus global warming versus global cooling.

748
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It's about finding an alternative energy source.

749
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Because if we find alternative energy,

750
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
then we'll solve if you believe.

751
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And that's fine.

752
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
If you believe that people are the are killing the earth.

753
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
We're killing people killing ourselves.

754
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
That's for sure.

755
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
But if you think our actions are killing the earth and the earth will not survive.

756
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Uh, I'm, I'm pretty sure you're wrong there.

757
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Uh, will it, it might make it uninhabitable for us.

758
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But not just through CO2 through all kinds of shit.

759
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
We're putting in the air in the water.

760
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And your government, by the way, is responsible for a lot of that.

761
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But at the end of the day when it comes to fossil fuel,

762
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
it's just a dumb system because we're all in slave to it.

763
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
We're all in slave to oil.

764
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And the energy elite who control it,

765
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:50,000
they can control it because we've become accustomed to having electricity and energy in different forms.

766
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So if we can find different forms of energy, then we all win.

767
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So I'm not really going to go back and talk about it,

768
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
but I'm happy to hear what you have to say.

769
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
To add a my own take on it.

770
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So global warming is definitely here.

771
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And you're giving the impression that it's not coming off.

772
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It's a bit of a crackpot.

773
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
No, I am a crackpot.

774
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
A cook, another job.

775
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That's what they always say about people who are actually telling the truth.

776
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Uh, of course, now it's your word against mine because you're just saying,

777
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
it's here.

778
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And I'm saying, it's not here.

779
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And uh, show me the measurements and I'll show you my measurements.

780
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Who can you believe, who can you trust?

781
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Um, it sure doesn't feel much warmer here in the United Kingdom.

782
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
That's intended or not.

783
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yes, in some places is getting colder,

784
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
but in a lot of places is getting hotter.

785
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So that's a good point.

786
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Does that even out?

787
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Does that strike you across each other off the list?

788
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
What is the ideal temperature for the earth?

789
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I wouldn't mind it being a little bit warmer being here in Britain.

790
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
No problem.

791
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
A little bit of global warming is not going to kill me.

792
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And maybe if you live in a Canada,

793
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
you may be happy if it's a little bit cooler.

794
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Or less cooler, I should say.

795
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
warmer.

796
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I don't know.

797
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I really don't know.

798
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But I'm not just taking it like that.

799
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm happy to talk about it.

800
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I'm happy to listen to all kinds of conversations.

801
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
But the minute it gets ramrotted down our throats into the CO2 carbon tax and credit system.

802
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
No.

803
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Then I just got to stay stop on against it.

804
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And wait around for someone to prove it.

805
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
They've already got the laws written for the shit.

806
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And we're still discussing it over here.

807
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Who's running this place?

808
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Don't call us.

809
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
We'll call you.

810
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And on average, the temperature is going on.

811
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
But I think every person missing the fundamental point,

812
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
which is, isn't man made or not.

813
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Now, you mentioned the sun, you know, as a source of life well.

814
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Well, all warmth comes from the sun.

815
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
End of story.

816
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
That's where it comes from.

817
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Okay.

818
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So if you got clouds formed by whatever you get less sun, you get less heat.

819
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
It's the sun.

820
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
The sun's being blocked.

821
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
It all comes from the sun.

822
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Is it being man made?

823
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Uh.

824
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
What happens is the sun was going through a period of cycle.

825
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
See, every million years where it got slightly hotter.

826
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Well, actually, we just went through an 11-year cycle.

827
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Where the sun spot activity stopped all together,

828
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
the month of October.

829
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Uh, yeah, October.

830
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Um, and that could kick up again.

831
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You know, ham radio operators know this.

832
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
We used to do something that was generated by the ionosphere,

833
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
uh, particular due to sun spot activity.

834
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And we would utilize something called skip.

835
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
We could bounce your signal halfway across the globe.

836
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
This is, this is not new.

837
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Of course, the sun is responsible for all one thunder.

838
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Which makes the air sense lightly hotter.

839
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You know, there's no human record that goes on.

840
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And the Earth, by the way, is not a G.E. light bulb.

841
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
It's a bunch of explosive gases that, uh, you know, it's doing shit all the time.

842
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It's, it's a living organism.

843
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It's, uh, it's spewing off a regular heat.

844
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
That's just what it is.

845
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Uh, far back.

846
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So the fundamental question still stands is is global warming.

847
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Our climate change caused by burning up fossil fuels.

848
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And the whole introduction of this carbon credit is based on no evidence to say

849
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
that the change in the climate and global warming is because of what we're doing to it.

850
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
It's bullshit.

851
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Um, I just want to pass that on.

852
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Uh, also, well, one of your coming to Sydney, let this Sydney listeners know.

853
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So we can, you know, set up a meet and greet.

854
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Um, great here.

855
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Hope you went.

856
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Um, and that, yeah, we can, can you stop things for cities?

857
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
But all those President, you know, what happened to, you know, some love, like the

858
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
prostate cancer prevention course.

859
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Uh, anyway, they are supposed to work for us.

860
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Right on well, then I suggest that you help me out my friend.

861
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Uh, I need lots of Australian porn stars helping me find Australian energy, alternative forms of energy.

862
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So, uh, we could have some fun with that.

863
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,920
with that could we just not just have a meet and greet come on let's have some people

864
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,040
come out we've got a stand for a by the way do you guys actually have a freedom of expression

865
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:27,800
and freedom of speech in Australia it shouldn't sound like it and the same thing happening

866
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,640
here in the United Kingdom but seems like they're a little bit further down the road there

867
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:37,640
in Australia and I look at these sites man this is like adult people doing adult stuff

868
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:44,760
what and it's nothing illegal as far as I can tell so let's get some of those get me the

869
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:52,280
the woman from the sex party can I talk to her can you reach out to her will have some fun

870
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,720
yeah I definitely want to come down but let's not just let's not throw anything away in a meet and

871
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,720
greet let's actually get something done I want to visit these guys who are making these these alternative

872
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:10,680
engines with magnets and and and Joe sells and hydroxy based hydrogen things you know this is

873
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,440
the stuff we got to look into we've got to bring it to the forefront we've got to make

874
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:20,920
YouTube videos I guess and post them far and wide and and try and professionalize a little bit

875
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,760
because I think it was just taken as seriously you know it's another bunch of cooks in the garage

876
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,360
doing some crazy shit and it doesn't work now that stuff works

877
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:38,920
tough to us chuckle heads but there's more of us looking at the stats ever since and I know that

878
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,520
you're bummed out man we don't talk about porn enough but I'm trying to up the quotient

879
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:52,040
the numbers have almost doubled on this show it's absolutely astounding how many people are

880
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:58,760
tuning in and from so many different corners of the earth. Adam high Lars here in Kansas City and I

881
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:08,120
just dropped a song called Revolution Sun by an artist named David Zooming from Kansas City as well

882
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:14,440
and man I think this is gonna fit in great with your show I think it says it all it's a

883
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:28,120
but it is a song hope so give it a spin and please please stay stoned first take of Revolution Sun

884
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:45,480
this is the question that I want to ask you have you heard the coming call the disaster

885
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:53,480
yeah it's clean the trouble coming fast now for a reason that it's telling you

886
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:01,640
it did the feeling that they want to throw us we best see and only play

887
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:09,160
photos they keep you secret and they're gunning for more trust don't seem right

888
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:24,840
it ain't what we do to the rave of a new Johnson it's shining down on everyone shining down on

889
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:49,320
everyone shining down on every home yeah it's clearly and it's coming faster

890
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:58,280
what will you do on the morning after we got a father put you calling us faster it's

891
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:16,680
why do you curse us when it isn't for the rave of a new Johnson it's shining down on everyone

892
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,320
don't you say

893
00:45:49,320 --> 00:46:19,320

Oh, yeah, it's clear the end is coming fast

895
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:28,320
What we do, home morning after

896
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:33,320
We got to find the books you call on the best

897
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:39,320
What do you curse when it isn't true?

898
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,320
Yeah, right on man, I like that Revolution Sun

899
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:53,320
On a daily source code episode number eight hundred and five moving into our president electing the United States

900
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:57,320
President Obama and what better way to get started then

901
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,320
With our European Union correspondent

902
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,320
Comic strip

903
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,320
Comic strip

904
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,320
Comic strip

905
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,320
Comic strip

906
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,320
No, you see as me come on in

907
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,320
Hello, I'm Obama my carry

908
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,320
You see as be your EU correspondent

909
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,320
So EU has reopened talks with Russia

910
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,320
Despite objection from Lithuania

911
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:30,320
And Poland has withdrawn its objections about it

912
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
Yeah, that's that is indeed quite interesting

913
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,320
And I am keeping my eye on that

914
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,320
And I appreciate you doing the same there CSB by the way

915
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,320
Yesterday

916
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,320
Oh man

917
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,320
Yesterday I saw that CNBC was in Russia

918
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,320
Aaron Burnett

919
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,320
Oh man, I love this girl

920
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,320
Aaron Burnett was in Russia

921
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,320
And she was trying on

922
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,320
Free hats in a hat store

923
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,320
And she's so cute

924
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,320
I told Patricia yesterday I said

925
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,320
Because you know I think most couples have a list

926
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,320
If you don't you need to institute one

927
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,320
Just as a hedge it's really important you never know

928
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,320
I said I mean you want I'm taking Angelina Jolie off the list

929
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,320
I'm replacing her with Aaron Burnett

930
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,320
And Patricia said interesting choice

931
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,320
Anyway that was my sorry

932
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:25,320
Just I drifted away into Russia for second CSB sorry

933
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,320
So Silvio even Silvio Belusconi

934
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,320
The just President of Italy you know he likes to joke

935
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,320
Even invited Russia to join EU

936
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,320
But Russia declined

937
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:42,320
But personally I have to say that I want to see Russia as a full member of EU too

938
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,320
And by the way good luck to your daughter Kristina

939
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,320
In her acting career

940
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,320
You

941
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,320
What's that?

942
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,320
What's that?

943
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,320
People were happy

944
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,320
Are you glad that Barack is there?

945
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:00,320
I am very very glad that Barack Obama won

946
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,320
I have no idea what that is

947
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,320
Under the end

948
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,320
Thank you CSB

949
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,320
Well yes

950
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,320
Keep in my eye on this

951
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,320
Because you know it's so easy to become distracted

952
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,320
Or just tune out or zone out

953
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,320
I think that's what's happening

954
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,320
I've seen two videos

955
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,320
One is the 60 minutes piece

956
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,320
That was a sit down interview with the President elect

957
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,320
And the second is the weekly address

958
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,320
Which is getting

959
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,320
Actually a lot less attention

960
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,320
than I thought it was getting

961
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
You know how the President does a weekly radio address

962
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,320
Which I subscribe to you can find it in my channels

963
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,320
Go to Adam.mevio.com

964
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,320
And you can actually subscribe to

965
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,320
With one subscription you can subscribe to every single show I listen to

966
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,320
Well that's need to hear no or there

967
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,320
So the Presidential radio address is always one of them

968
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,320
I just have to laugh because I think oftentimes

969
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,320
It's like Donna just this kind of an afterthought

970
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,320
Oh yeah we got to the radio address

971
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,320
But a lot of people actually listen to that

972
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,320
So now Obama is doing the his weekly address

973
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,320
He's putting it on change.gov

974
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,320
Which by the way

975
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,320
The agenda has still

976
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,320
Not been put back into place

977
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:18,320
Remember the entire Obama agenda was scrubbed off of the website

978
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,320
Uh-huh

979
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,320
There's a little article from the

980
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,320
Washington Times that put in the show notes about that

981
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,320
But this YouTube video

982
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,320
So you know what?

983
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,320
Cheapsville

984
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,320
Frick and Cheapsville

985
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,320
It does not pay attention

986
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,320
And what they're doing

987
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,320
Because there is a lot of

988
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,320
There's a lot of people out here on the interwebs

989
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,320
Pay attention to stuff

990
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,320
And you know so I guess we kind of let it slide

991
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,320
Yeah, all right so change.gov

992
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,320
Change the agenda's been it's not even a menu item anymore

993
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,320
They've taken it all fall together

994
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,320
Which is always suspicious

995
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,320
Although you can still pretty much find the same

996
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:59,320
Information but not always the full detail plans at Barack Obama.com

997
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,320
I saved all those pages and I'm so happy I did

998
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,320
I want to be able to refer back to them from time to time

999
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,320
But the video is just cheese

1000
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,320
And when will the

1001
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,320
I love I love the signage

1002
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,320
It still says the office of the president elect

1003
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,320
It's it made up

1004
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,320
It doesn't exist. There's no such thing

1005
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,320
He's still a I guess still a senator

1006
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,320
That's it

1007
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,320
But anyway

1008
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,320
So everyone wants him to come out and say some

1009
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,320
And okay, I think we all pretty much realize

1010
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,320
No one can fix the jam that we're in

1011
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,320
But he keeps it is basically what he's saying

1012
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,320
Well, it's not going to be easy

1013
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,320
He's not saying anything

1014
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,320
He's not giving us any insights

1015
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,320
Into what is policy is in fact

1016
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,320
I thought it was pretty insulting

1017
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,320
When the interviewer on the 60 minutes

1018
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,320
Was trying to you know

1019
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,320
Ask questions about his cabinet

1020
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,320
And would he actually appoint Hillary Clinton

1021
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,320
And you know, instead of some diplomatic answer

1022
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,320
Like, well, you know, I have to live and finalize

1023
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,320
And I want to talk to everyone and weigh all my options

1024
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,320
Instead, the president elect is saying

1025
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,320
You're not going to get that out of me

1026
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,320
You're not getting more out of me

1027
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,320
You're not getting anything out of me

1028
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,320
That was that didn't feel right

1029
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,320
Doesn't feel right to a

1030
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,320
A Georgia congressman

1031
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,320
I saved this link earlier

1032
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,320
This is from November 10

1033
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,320
Quote, it may sound a bit crazy

1034
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,320
Enough base, but the thing is he's the one who proposed this

1035
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,320
National Security Force representative Paul Braun

1036
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,320
Instead of a bond, I'll buy my day interview Monday

1037
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,320
With the associated press

1038
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,320
I'm just trying to bring attention to fact that we may

1039
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,320
May not, I hope not

1040
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,320
But we may have a problem with that type of philosophy

1041
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,320
Or radical socialism or Marxism

1042
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,320
Hmm

1043
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,320
So some people, someone's speaking up

1044
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,320
That's good

1045
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,320
Not that anything's being done with it

1046
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,320
It's being completely ignored

1047
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,320
Ah, let's see, where is it?

1048
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,320
So I made a whole bunch of notes

1049
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,320
About the CBS interview

1050
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,320
Now links in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

1051
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,320
And crosspost it at curie.com

1052
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,320
So just some, and I'm not going to run through the whole thing

1053
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,320
It's like 18 or 19 minutes, but just some notes

1054
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,320
First of all, this piece is heavily edited

1055
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,320
It's funny, Christina's not hanging out with Dexter a lot

1056
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,320
Dexter has a little production company

1057
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,320
And he does, I don't want to say which show he does

1058
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,320
He edits one of those paranormal shows

1059
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,320
That's on television

1060
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,320
And Christina is saying it's amazing, you know

1061
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,320
He suits all this footage and it's kind of lame

1062
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,320
But then he starts taking out all the shit

1063
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,320
The guy got wrong and then he's actually replacing words

1064
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,320
Where someone said no, he puts in the word yes

1065
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,320
And of course that's the way television works

1066
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,320
That's show business, that's entertainment

1067
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,320
And it's no different for news

1068
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,320
I became a profit center

1069
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,320
It used to be a huge loss leader

1070
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,320
Doing investigative journalism, sending reporters on the road for weeks

1071
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,320
To get a story, they don't do that anymore

1072
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,320
Just read press releases and pieces even come in

1073
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,320
Pre-package video already edited

1074
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,320
So this piece has been heavily edited

1075
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,320
The first thing on the present elects

1076
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,320
Mine slash agenda is national security

1077
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,320
And this is about this, and this is frightening

1078
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,320
I would have to agree

1079
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:16,320
The president elect has already called for a national security force

1080
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,320
That means living amongst us that are equal in size

1081
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,320
And equally well funded as the armed forces

1082
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,320
That's going to be a lot of hardware walking around

1083
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,320
So national security first frightens me

1084
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,320
Then the economy, okay

1085
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,320
Then energy and health care

1086
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,320
When asked if he's in sync with the

1087
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,320
Secretary of the Treasury's actions

1088
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,320
President elect Obama did not answer the question

1089
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,320
He just said, well he's worked tirelessly

1090
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,320
More about that in a minute

1091
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,320
Dennis Cassini had a great quote for a Neil Cushkari

1092
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,320
Which is a Paulson's little butt boy there

1093
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,320
Running around doing his dirty work

1094
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,320
But yeah, sure

1095
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,320
Paulson's been working very hard to give his buddy bonuses

1096
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,320
And remember that Obama took money from Wall Street

1097
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:07,320
So he can't just all of a sudden become the enemy

1098
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,320
Just like he can't become the enemy of the unions

1099
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,320
He took millions from the unions

1100
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,320
Like the United Auto Workers Union

1101
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,320
And so he's totally if they don't get a bail out

1102
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,320
From the current administration he's going to bail him out

1103
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,320
This is just how it works

1104
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,320
So no surprise

1105
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,320
But of course

1106
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:33,320
President elect Obama says, well you know things could be a lot worse

1107
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,320
So I guess something that Paulson is doing is working

1108
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:40,320
But he didn't really say if he wasn't sync with him or not

1109
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,320
And then of course

1110
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:46,320
Came the whole the bail out discussion about the auto industry

1111
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,320
And why he pulled out the bridge to nowhere

1112
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,320
Thing with another fun little quick

1113
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320
You know I want to build a bridge to somewhere

1114
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,320
But he's still campaigning you already got the job man

1115
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,320
You know now speak to us like normal people

1116
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,320
I'm ready for it

1117
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,320
And then he goes into this whole wrap about

1118
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,320
Well the banks aren't lending yeah, but you think that what Hank Paulson is doing is he's working hard

1119
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,320
Making it work well it's not working

1120
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,320
It's complete contradiction

1121
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,320
Anyway, where's all this money come we're going to come

1122
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,320
I'm just distilling this whole interview for you

1123
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,320
It's worth it so when asked the question where the money for the bail out would come from

1124
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,320
And the president elect said we're not going to worry about the deficit

1125
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,320
So in other words it's going to take it either from taxes or it's going to print it

1126
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,320
He promises to shut down going Guantanamo Bay

1127
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:36,320
Promise is to stop torture Iraq he says as soon as he takes office

1128
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:41,320
The plan will be executed to draw down troops from Iraq and send them to Afghanistan

1129
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:46,320
Don't you see and no one's complaining of oh, yeah, well Afghanistan

1130
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:51,320
Yeah, that's the yeah, we should be there. That's the right place to be yeah put our troops know of good

1131
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,320
Is that why?

1132
00:56:52,320 --> 00:57:00,320
Tell me why we should be in Afghanistan besides to protect the poppy fields of the US government can truck it into the US

1133
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,320
Bin Laden's not there

1134
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,320
If he's alive, which is highly questionable

1135
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:12,320
I got a link in the show notes about that in that you'll find it right right in the Obama heading

1136
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:24,320
Plenty of data points that could lead you to believe that Osama bin Laden does not even it's not even alive anymore

1137
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:32,320
So yeah, how many troops it was the plan all right, so we're taking our troops out of Iraq sending them to Afghanistan

1138
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,320
So we're not actually bringing them home

1139
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,320
Stamp out al Qaeda still high on the president elects agenda

1140
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:49,320
Well, I think we should identify what al Qaeda is instead of what it really is which is just a list of names that the US government put together

1141
00:57:50,320 --> 00:58:05,320
Capturing bin Laden the critical aspect of that he's the operational leader who's planning attacks on US targets actively panning and planning attacks. It's what he said they're planning attacks. I should we better put our security alert to high

1142
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:14,320
And then what really really makes me laugh is now he's talking about Lincoln

1143
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:20,320
And I believe that's because Lincoln was known for having Republicans and Democrats in his cabinet

1144
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:28,320
But the real cool thing about Clint about to Lincoln is first of all Hillary Clinton also said she's been reading up on Lincoln

1145
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,320
How interesting is that

1146
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:40,320
But Lincoln and this is the reason why I believe he was ultimately assassinated by the by the banking cartel is he came up with a whole concept of greenbacks

1147
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:47,320
Which was money handed out by the government and it was not did not involve the central banks

1148
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:53,320
And it was really a beautiful system and to this day we still talk about greenbacks

1149
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:58,320
Although that we don't really know the history of it go read up on the green the wiki pd has a reasonable page about the greenback

1150
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:05,320
Read up on that and then you'll see why it's highly likely that president Lincoln was assassinated

1151
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:12,320
For that being one of the one of the reasons is that he just didn't want to play with the bankers

1152
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:24,320
Okay, into the bailout now I have put a whole crap load of YouTube clips into into this section which you'll see in the show notes

1153
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:32,320
Because it is so phenomenal to see that on mainstream on television a lot of it's from C span

1154
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:39,320
But it's now being a sniped and clipped and edited and put out there is the empirical proof by admission

1155
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,320
That this bank bailout of

1156
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:53,320
700 billion dollars which was the official number even though there's another two trillion on that which was lent out by the federal reserve which they refused to report who they lent it out to your money

1157
00:59:54,320 --> 01:00:02,320
My money they're refusing because of course we all know by now that they're handing it out to their buddies their buddies are taking huge bonuses

1158
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:07,320
And Congress thank God some members are

1159
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,320
Starting to get really annoyed by this

1160
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:17,320
And they're starting to call these guys on it so here is I just got to play a couple of these for you

1161
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,320
Let's see

1162
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,320
Which one is this

1163
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:31,320
Okay, this is this is actually the what's his name. I like this guy. He's the the ticker guy ticker tape guy

1164
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:38,320
Whatever's name is so he he actually had a little I couldn't find this YouTube clip but I'm going to play it for you because he played the audio of it as well

1165
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:50,320
And this is one of these congressional hearings. I know it sounds really boring and you know G why should we watch that but here's the you're going to love this this is actual admission

1166
01:00:51,320 --> 01:01:00,320
That 350 billion dollars of the 700 billion dollar bailout was actually intended for foreign investors

1167
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,320
Not even for United States citizens or corporations here listen to

1168
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:10,320
Questioning you'll test carry. Yeah, here we go. Listen to this.

1169
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:16,320
Just to send it wasn't in the meeting where Secretary Paulson came in with the vice president and Fed Chairman Bernankey

1170
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:27,320
And made all these assurances that there was absolutely a critical immediate need to get rid of the corrosive derivative products

1171
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:36,320
You know this is this is how they went into the into the Congress into the Senate and threatened everybody that if you know the world is going to come crashing down

1172
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:41,320
We're all going to die if we don't start put it this money and immediately we've got to buy these toxic assets

1173
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,320
And of course now they're not doing that anymore

1174
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:50,320
And listen to this bit all the different names for this and you know ubiquitous, you know

1175
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:55,320
Sub S retraided credit default swap blah blah blah blah blah

1176
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,320
Okay, but they they talked about them as though they knew what the hell they were

1177
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:08,320
You got the money and you immediately said what items what auction

1178
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,320
Would you please respond to under oath

1179
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:25,320
When did you go from what you did what you told members of Congress in open and closed sessions was the absolute reason to have this money immediately to buy a specific group of assets about

1180
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:33,320
350 billion in the US about 350 billion held by other countries and and other funds outside the US

1181
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:38,320
So they even knew when they passed this bill they knew

1182
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:44,320
That half of the money was to bail out foreigners there's they're meeting it

1183
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:52,320
This guy may be all heavy handed on cash carry and on Paulson, but same time he's incriminating himself

1184
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:59,320
Here's Elijah Cummings. He had a nice little quote for Neil Cushkari

1185
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,320
You'll hold this Mr. Cash carry

1186
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:09,320
In the neighborhood I grew up in and it's a cash cash carry. I should say this Elijah Cummings

1187
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:14,320
Representative he's a Democrat from Maryland 7th district city of Baltimore

1188
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:21,320
One of the things that you tried to do was make sure that you were not considered a chump

1189
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:30,320
And what chump meant was that you didn't want to see when people see you as just somebody they could get over on

1190
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,320
And I'm just wondering

1191
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:41,320
How you feel about an AIG

1192
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,320
Given five hundred and three million dollars worth of bonuses

1193
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,320
Out of one hand

1194
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,320
And except in a hundred and fifty four be in

1195
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,320
From hard working taxpayers

1196
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:03,320
You know because I'm trying to get I'm trying to make sure you get it

1197
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:10,320
You know I mean they got a shot of a space here. He's going like oh, you'll you'll think I'll go through all

1198
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,320
And you know what would really bothers me

1199
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:19,320
Is because all these other people who will land up yep

1200
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:27,320
They say well this guy's good. This Elijah Cummings all I can is cash carry a chump a

1201
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,320
Chump we can just go in there and I'm not saying they are I don't know

1202
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,320
We can go in there

1203
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,320
We'll get to money and you know what AIG did they even will tell you they coming back for some more

1204
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:44,320
And they have the nerve

1205
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:52,320
The nerve to grant some five hundred and three million dollars worth of bonuses

1206
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,320
Oh, man

1207
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,320
I mean this is out in the open

1208
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,320
How can you not be outraged by this I am

1209
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:05,320
Call your congressman look him up look up your senators

1210
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:12,320
If they voted for this bailout package you need to send them a very clear message

1211
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,320
And if they didn't you need to send them an equally clear message

1212
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,320
There'll be a lot less of you sending that message by the way

1213
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:25,320
And support them and say good on you people need positive reinforcement as well

1214
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:31,320
You know don't just sit there listening to your fricking eye pod listen to me bitch about it do something about it already

1215
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:41,320
You gotta do something about it we have a representative government take them out take them out if they're not doing what what they should be doing take them out

1216
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,320
By voting obviously not suggesting anything else

1217
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:50,320
Here's another great great quote. This may be Kushin it's Kushin it's Kushin it's

1218
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,320
Oh, no, this is coming again

1219
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,320
Thank you for the opportunity to be here today

1220
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,320
Just to Mr. Cummings

1221
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:06,320
I don't know how to work any harder than we're already working and I take your feedback very seriously

1222
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:12,320
That's why we're working as hard as we are and we're just going to keep doing and trying to accomplish and meet your expectations

1223
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,320
Thank you very much if I may

1224
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,320
Take the bragged best chair to stay out of the anyone

1225
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,320
Questions Mr. Kushin

1226
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,320
That you're working hard

1227
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,320
Talk question

1228
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,320
You're working for oh

1229
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:39,020
Beautiful you won't see that on the news who you're working for I love it

1230
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:46,820
There's a whole there's a couple more I'm not going to play them all for you there is one one great link which you should read through

1231
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:54,320
It's a titled who is hand who is Henry Paulson and we see this guy's history. It's no wonder the a in fact

1232
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:04,320
He's been in government before here. Paulson rose to the ranks of Goldman Sachs becoming a partner 82 co-head of investment banking in 1990 and

1233
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:16,320
Chief operating officer 94 in 1998 he forced out his co-chairman John Coursine who is now governor and New Jersey in what amounted to a coup according to New York Times

1234
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:22,320
And where is this this is great piece here?

1235
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,320
There were questions at one point because there's a whole bunch of guys

1236
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:37,320
Here we go Goldman Sachs is perhaps the single best connected Wall Street firm. It's executives returned routinely go in and out of top government post

1237
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:42,320
Coursine went on to become US a senator from New Jersey and it's now states governor exactly

1238
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:50,320
Coursine's predecessor Stephen Friedman served in the Bush administration as an assistant to the president for economic policy and as chairman of the National Economic Council

1239
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,320
Friedman's predecessor as Goldman Sach CEO Robert Rubin

1240
01:07:55,320 --> 01:08:06,320
served as chairman of the National Economic Council later treasuries secretary under bill Clinton these guys are all over at the banks have taken over and now we're going to make it legal

1241
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:22,320
America has been given 100 days to comply with what Europe is setting up the IMF will be in the middle of it all go look at what the G20 talked about what the news they released over the weekend it's all on the drop you can all find it in show notes and it drop drop dot AOS slash daily source code

1242
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:34,320
IMF which is another group of private bankers they're going to sit in the middle of it and here come the CO2 credits you watch on their way

1243
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:47,320
Let's see and just the long actually this kind of leads into the economy in general but American Express which of course we know is a credit card company

1244
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:54,320
Most people would notice a credit card company is now become a bank so they can also receive money from their buddy Paulson

1245
01:08:54,320 --> 01:09:01,320
And the meantime had the foreclosure slow down has been easier to get alone for a car purchase

1246
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:06,320
How's your business doing this is the stuff we need to be looking at

1247
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:11,320
Tens of thousands of people being laid off sometimes on a daily basis

1248
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:16,320
And we're going to go out and we're going to bail out the auto industry

1249
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:27,320
Hi, I would like to suggest an automobile industry bailout package that will result millions of dollars being spent on high price tookters sushi bars and trips to Vegas

1250
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,320
This is how it work.

1251
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,320
Well, it sounds kind of boring.

1252
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:36,320
We go to Bernie Frank and say, Bernie how much money is available for bailout he says 50 million dollars or whatever

1253
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:43,320
Next, using the same process that is used to determine who may receive an economic stimulus check

1254
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,320
We determine who may receive a certificate for a brand new car

1255
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:56,320
Now when you receive your certificate you go to a Ford Chrysler or General Motors dealership look around pick out a car you like

1256
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:00,320
And over your certificate you go home with a brand new car

1257
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,320
The dealer he collects payment from the government

1258
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,320
You know, and that could be negotiated

1259
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,320
Maybe cost of the car plus 10% whatever

1260
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,320
The salesman gets paid

1261
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,320
The dealership gets paid

1262
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,320
Automobile manufacturer gets paid

1263
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,320
Everybody wins on this except for maybe the high price sugars

1264
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,320
So think about this

1265
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:27,320
Suggested to your congressman and now I'm driving 11 year old car and I can really use a new one

1266
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,320
Thank you

1267
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:33,320
You know, it's really sad to me that this is the kind of thinking that's going on the United States because

1268
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:39,320
The sooner we realize that someone has to get hurt from this economic downturn

1269
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,320
Let me just call it that and the better

1270
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,320
Because

1271
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,320
Something has to go something has to budge

1272
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:52,320
And right now it seems like the only people actually about to get hurt is going to be the middle class

1273
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,320
Whether it's directly through taxes

1274
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,320
Because someone has to pay for these bailouts

1275
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,320
I mean it's just not free money

1276
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,320
Yes, it's free in the regard that you can print it

1277
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:04,320
But then you get it back in inflation and the prices reflected it at the grocery store

1278
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:08,320
So there is no for that as I say there is no free lunch

1279
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,320
And it's time for someone to step up

1280
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,320
I mean the way I see the auto industry

1281
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:18,320
Yeah, are you kidding me this thing is far reaching it is a huge part of the economy

1282
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,320
But it's failing now anyway

1283
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:25,320
And that's a mindset we're in this mindset that we're killing the earth

1284
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,320
We need to consume less. Okay, we're good little slaves we're doing our job

1285
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:38,320
And now it's we're going to because we're doing our job and being good little slaves and buying less crap and being less less of a consumerist

1286
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:43,320
Which of course is exactly not what the government wants since our entire economy

1287
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,320
Revolves around consumers buying stuff and borrowing money to buy it

1288
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:54,320
Now we're going to be penalized on top of that no with taxes or inflation. Oh, that's not what should happen

1289
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,320
Let the auto industry fail

1290
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,320
I definitely think we should honor the pensions

1291
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,320
I'm not quite sure how much money that is it's clearly going to be billions, but

1292
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:11,320
Take care of the pensioners. So we'll split the difference. You know what there's new car companies

1293
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:16,320
There's tons of them give them incentives let them take over in the marketplace

1294
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:18,320
They're still

1295
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:26,320
Manufacturers who are non unionized who are doing okay. There's Japanese manufacturing going on in the United States of Japanese vehicles

1296
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:30,320
It's not like the entire auto industry is dead

1297
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,320
And we'll have new cars

1298
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:38,320
Within a year we'll have new new businesses and people can go to work at these new businesses

1299
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,320
Well, I've fact reads that the new car companies can

1300
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,320
Can roll into

1301
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,320
I don't you know there's a million different thing go buy the assets of Ford Ford Mondale

1302
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:54,320
Whatever it's called in the States great drivers car built the keep that as the chassis now put your battery shit on there

1303
01:12:54,320 --> 01:13:00,320
And your windmill and whatever else is going to drive these things there's tons of things we can do tons

1304
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,320
Bailing out

1305
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,320
Not the option I'm looking for

1306
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,320
Not a good idea

1307
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:15,320
Several months ago it seems actually maybe it was a year ago I sent a note to Jeff Smith the Jeff Smith and I said Jeff dude

1308
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:18,320
These lyrics are floating around Wall Street

1309
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,320
It's to the tune of Bohemian Rhapsody

1310
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:24,320
I really think it'll be funny if you if you cut this track

1311
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:32,320
And I of course we played a lot of it a year ago a year ago when all this crap started to hit the fan and it's just as current today

1312
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,320
Is this the real price

1313
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:37,320
Is this just fantasy

1314
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,320
Financial landslide

1315
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,320
No escape from reality

1316
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,320
Open your eyes

1317
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:51,320
Look up at your buys and see

1318
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,320
I'm now a boy

1319
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,320
Hailing casualty

1320
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,320
Cause I bought it high

1321
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,320
Watched it blow

1322
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,320
Rating high

1323
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,320
Now you'll know

1324
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:07,320
Any way the thing

1325
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:12,320
Cause doesn't really matter to me

1326
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,320
To me

1327
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,320
Mama

1328
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,320
Just killed my friend

1329
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:26,320
Could it sitios instead

1330
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,320
Pulled the trigger now it's damn

1331
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:32,320
Mama

1332
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,320
I had just begun

1333
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:39,320
These sitios have blown it all away

1334
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,320
I still want to buy

1335
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:53,320
Sometimes we should never let go of it all

1336
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:09,320
I see a little silly way to open

1337
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,320
Keep it a kid

1338
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:13,320
Can you say the old market

1339
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,320
I know the new is very very funny

01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,320
Super Senior

1355
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,320
Super Junior

1356
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,320
Super senior

1357
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,320
Super senior

1358
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,320
Super senior

1359
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,320
Super senior

1360
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,320
Super senior

1361
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:45,320
Super senior

1362
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,320
Super senior

1363
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:51,320
Super senior

1364
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:52,320
Super senior

1365
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,320
Super senior

1366
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,320
Super senior

1367
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,320
Super senior

1368
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,320
Super senior

1369
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:15,320
So you think you could find me and spit in my eye?

1370
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:21,320
Then the bottom and call me and leave me a time.

1371
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:27,320
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby.

1372
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:32,320
Just got it out, just got it right out of here.

1373
01:16:51,320 --> 01:17:02,320
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1374
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:12,320
No price really matters, no liquidity, nothing really matters.

1375
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:19,320
No price really matters to me.

1376
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:39,320
The Jeff Smith Financial Rhapsody.

1377
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:42,320
Thank you, darling.

1378
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,320
My lovely wife just brought me up.

1379
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:49,320
This is an official club sandwich.

1380
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:57,320
Hold on, let us tomato bacon, that sounds like a BLT.

1381
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,320
Thank you, darling.

1382
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:06,320
There you go.

1383
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,320
This is actually something really good.

1384
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:14,320
But again, it just frightens me to read how we're thinking.

1385
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:21,320
This is about the Aspire Visa card and you can find this link is from consumeraffairs.com.

1386
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:30,320
What Aspire essentially is doing is closing out a lot of its accounts shortening the or tightening the credit lines.

1387
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:34,320
And so this is a page of consumer complaints.

1388
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:43,320
And when you read this, people don't understand that the complaining about debt that is being slowly closed down on them,

1389
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:46,320
exactly the right thing to do.

1390
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,320
It makes so much sense.

1391
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:58,320
You should not be complaining about Aspire Visa, maybe going out of business or whatever, clearly they have financial reasons for closing down their lines of debt.

1392
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,320
But you should be happy.

1393
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:07,320
This is a message to you because they're telling you, hey, you know what, you should kind of look out with your behavior.

1394
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:17,320
You can't just keep on using the credit card, save some money, save some money.

1395
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:20,320
By stuff on lay-away if you have to.

1396
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:24,320
I think Walmart is even doing that these days.

1397
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:28,320
But you look at this page just complaint after complaint about, well, you know,

1398
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,320
I was being closed down.

1399
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,320
My credit rating is going to go be shit.

1400
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,320
You know what?

1401
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,320
You need to be closed down.

1402
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,320
You really do and to and check yourself.

1403
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,320
Take a look at what you're buying.

1404
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:46,320
Seriously, there's no reason to be spending your money on shit.

1405
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:52,320
And you know, and every single time I went shopping, I went shopping and then I've, you know,

1406
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:57,320
and you see that great little piece of clothing you really, really want.

1407
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:01,320
I can just put it on the card, it'll only be another 10 bucks a month.

1408
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:06,320
So you get dragged into the hole that's 17% interest rates.

1409
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,320
Stop it.

1410
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,320
Please.

1411
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:13,320
Yeah, I'm this is Hans from Canada here.

1412
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,320
We're in Canada.

1413
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:22,320
I'm calling in about the, but all that carbon dioxide stuff.

1414
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:29,320
I know that you don't think that the climate is changing.

1415
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:34,320
I still think we should have the smallest footprint, but that's all.

1416
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,320
No, I do think the climate is changing.

1417
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:41,320
I just don't think it's going into a Solomon Gamora like an inconvenient truth.

1418
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,320
The least thing.

1419
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:47,320
What's quite interesting though is that I'm reading up more and more about the carbon dollar.

1420
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:54,320
And I just listen to the weather makers on an audiobook.

1421
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:59,320
And even he talks about the carbon dollars, which is really interesting.

1422
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:06,320
What baffles me is that the easiest way for the US to introduce the carbon dollars would have been to,

1423
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:13,320
to accept the Kyoto protocol and they haven't so.

1424
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:17,320
Well, this of course presumes that you think that the carbon credits,

1425
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:21,320
they're not talking about carbon dollars, but about carbon credits.

1426
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,320
This is because you assume that they're for good.

1427
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,320
They're not.

1428
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,320
They're there for their benefit.

1429
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:34,320
That being the, the bankers and the rich families of the world, the true owners of the globe.

1430
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:38,320
That's, if it was Kyoto, they would have no control over it.

1431
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,320
Then it would be like a consensus.

1432
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,320
Uh-huh.

1433
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,320
No, no, no.

1434
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,320
This is controlled.

1435
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,320
This is set up by private bankers again.

1436
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:50,320
I was setting up these, carbon credits, by the way, is great.

1437
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:53,320
Because you just say, okay, this is how much carbon you could produce.

1438
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:57,320
That's the finite resource, and then they can make that as expensive or cheap as they want.

1439
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,320
It's much easier to manipulate than the actual currency.

1440
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:06,320
So it's about carbon credits, not about carbon dollars, and they, in the United States, they,

1441
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:13,320
being the people who run our politicians, clearly, who force them under dress,

1442
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:16,320
to vote for the bailout for money in their pockets.

1443
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,320
These guys, that's who one carbon credits.

1444
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,320
They make it all run.

1445
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,320
They run the show.

1446
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:27,320
I'm not quite sure if that, if the carbon dollar is the master plan, why does the US not just simply

1447
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,320
agree to the Kyoto protocol?

1448
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,320
Because that would be the easiest and quickest way.

1449
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,320
Anyways.

1450
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,320
Um.

1451
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,320
Alright.

1452
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,320
You got something else here because you're repeating yourself now.

1453
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,320
Yeah.

1454
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,320
It's just gone completely out of hand with all the carbon stuff.

1455
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:48,320
I guess I saw in London that you can even have your own, uh, carbon neutral, um,

1456
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:52,320
offset, uh, mortgage from giraffe.

1457
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,320
Yeah.

1458
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,320
Right.

1459
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,320
Everyone's jumping on the ban wagon.

1460
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:02,320
Because whenever there's a trade of anything, and there's a, uh, a party in the middle,

1461
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,320
they're taking some money off the top.

1462
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,320
That's why it's, uh, it's hip.

1463
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,320
It's like Nike shoes.

1464
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,320
Got to have some carbon offset.

1465
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:12,320
Even you said the beginning right there, the top of your comment.

1466
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,320
Bro.

1467
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,320
I don't know.

1468
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,320
I got alarms all over the place.

1469
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,320
What's going on?

1470
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,320
I'm meeting.

1471
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:18,320
Fuck it.

1472
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,320
Um.

1473
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:22,320
Even you said right at the top of your comment there, uh,

1474
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,320
well, I think I should be reducing my, uh, my own footprint.

1475
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:26,320
Bullshit.

1476
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,320
Yeah.

1477
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:29,320
We should not be burning fossil fuel.

1478
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,320
It's unhealthy for us.

1479
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:33,320
That's the whole point.

1480
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,320
We're killing ourselves.

1481
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:41,320
But it seems to be pretty much a managed process right now by the people who are controlling the energy.

1482
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,320
I, yes.

1483
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,320
Oil.

1484
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,320
One of the true currencies of the earth.

1485
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,320
I had this as Justin.

1486
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,320
Um, daily source code number.

1487
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,320
But it's eight zero four.

1488
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,320
Once again, you're talking about oil, gold, and drugs.

1489
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,320
And you know what?

1490
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:56,320
I agree.

1491
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,320
Mostly except one major detail.

1492
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,320
Um, first you're saying it in the complete wrong order.

1493
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,320
Because if you say in a slightly different order, one could argue,

1494
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:09,320
there is a fourth tower pulling the strings.

1495
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,320
Now, you know what?

1496
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,320
I'm about to piss off a bunch of chuckle heads.

1497
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,320
Uh, most of your people.

1498
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:14,320
They're just listening.

1499
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,320
So, um, please send me your hate mail.

1500
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,320
It's back at last podcast.

1501
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:22,320
But I read it when you say it as gold, oil, and drugs.

1502
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,320
Yeah.

1503
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:24,320
Right?

1504
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:29,320
I mean, in my opinion, people will kill blindly for an all powerful man in the sky.

1505
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:30,320
Yeah.

1506
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:33,320
And they don't need anything in return except for the promise of what is it?

1507
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,320
72, 73 virgins.

1508
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,320
Or maybe by that's rising of the dead.

1509
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,320
Um, or the rising after you die.

1510
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,320
I don't know what it is.

1511
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:44,320
Living forever.

1512
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:48,320
But I do know that if you ascend the wrong religious groups,

1513
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,320
they will kill you.

1514
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,320
I don't know.

1515
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,320
It's just what I'm thinking.

1516
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,320
I love your show.

1517
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:54,320
I don't know.

1518
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,320
I love what he done with it.

1519
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:56,320
Um, great hair.

1520
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,320
Peace.

1521
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,320
I do like that, though.

1522
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,320
Because first of all, it isn't either the order.

1523
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:05,320
If you look at, uh, valuable, uh, currency in order of appearance in world history.

1524
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:07,320
Gold first, oil second.

1525
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:08,320
And drugs.

1526
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,320
Uh, drugs may have been early on.

1527
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,320
Uh, who knows, but I do like the GOD acronym that's pretty funny.

1528
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,320
Okay.

1529
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,320
From now on, that's official true currencies.

1530
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,320
The world, gold, oil, and drugs.

1531
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,320
And fast food.

1532
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,320
Of course.

1533
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,320
Ah, great report.

1534
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,320
If you ever go buy a burger anywhere, read this.

1535
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,320
Haha.

1536
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:34,320
Oh, from a study, American fast food is almost entirely produced from corn,

1537
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:39,320
according to a chemical analysis of dishes served at McDonald's Burger King and Wendy's.

1538
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:43,320
The study is published in the journal proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,

1539
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:45,320
whatever the hell that is.

1540
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:50,320
Uh, using a stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen to determine the origin,

1541
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:53,320
molecules, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1542
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,320
It's pretty much all made out of corn.

1543
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,320
Haha.

1544
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,320
I have a hundred and sixty food products.

1545
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,320
We purchased at Wendy's throughout the United States.

1546
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:05,320
Not one item could be traced back to a non-corn source.

1547
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:10,320
Now, you ever see, um, high fructose corn starch.

1548
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:14,320
You know, that stuff, it makes you fat.

1549
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,320
It makes you obese.

1550
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:21,320
And if 98% of all the food you're consuming because you're using your credit card

1551
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:25,320
and McDonald's is making you fat, here's your answer.

1552
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:31,320
You need to, oh, this is a big argument here at the, at the curry manner.

1553
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:35,320
You know, um, Patricia will always say, well, why can't people just make something healthy?

1554
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:37,320
Because it's too expensive.

1555
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:39,320
Go on and buy some vegetables.

1556
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:42,320
You can't, they, they even have on television.

1557
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:46,320
They, um, this is for, I think it's for Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1558
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,320
Uh, I don't know if it was in the, I don't know where I saw the commercial.

1559
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:54,320
But it's like, okay, let's go make our own Kentucky Fried Chicken and they go to the grocery store

1560
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:58,320
and they get the chicken and the little girl says, do you have any magic sauce?

1561
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,320
You know, whatever it is with a special sauce, the secret sauce.

1562
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:04,320
And so they can't put it all together because it will be way too expensive.

1563
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,320
It turns out the fast food, of course, is a lot cheaper.

1564
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:09,320
But it's not really food.

1565
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,320
Ah.

1566
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:18,320
And the food banks are now, um, if you've never been to a food bank, go look your local food bank up.

1567
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:21,320
And there's a pretty good article on the money central their MSN.com,

1568
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:22,320
which is in the show now.

1569
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,320
It's under the economy section for today's program.

1570
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:29,320
Uh, a lot of people rely on these to actually survive.

1571
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:35,320
41% more food distributed in October, 2008 than they did in October, 2007.

1572
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,320
And it's pretty pretty normal people.

1573
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:41,320
It may be even, you know, your neighbors or your colleague at work.

1574
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:45,320
And there's stuff that you can donate to these food banks.

1575
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:48,320
Money is, of course, the number one that will help the most.

1576
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:52,320
But look at these, uh, different categories of foods.

1577
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:57,320
And, you know, consider bringing a couple of those into your own home and keeping them for a while.

1578
01:27:57,320 --> 01:28:01,320
Because when the shit hits the fan, which is coming very, very close to my friends,

1579
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:04,320
when it really hits the fan, you're going to want some food.

1580
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:07,320
It'll be the most popular Christmas gift in 2012.

1581
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,320
Right there, this is Matthew Ebel.

1582
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:12,320
And you're about to hear a brand new song called Lost on Block Island.

1583
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:17,320
It's a song that I wrote while I was out on Block Island, Rhode Island, all summer long in 2008.

1584
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:19,320
Of course, if you like this song and you want to own it,

1585
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:23,320
you can go over to MatthewEbel.net and sign up for a subscription there.

1586
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:28,320
Of course, you better do it soon because this song's only going to be available for another month.

1587
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,320
But there's plenty more where this came from.

1588
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:36,320
I'll be sending out brand new songs every single month to the subscribers and only to the subscribers.

1589
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,320
So please check it out and I hope you enjoy the song.

1590
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:44,320
Again, Lost on Block Island.

1591
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:50,320
Nine miles of dry, and that's all you see.

1592
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:55,320
But somewhere between water, street, and the drugs I meet,

1593
01:28:55,320 --> 01:29:04,320
I lost my head and got caught in a current calling me out to the sea.

1594
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:10,320
It's hard to find peace out on Block Island.

1595
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:16,320
Said the peace you make, night ain't no lie.

1596
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:25,320
Everywhere there's tourists talking at me, and it makes me want to cry.

1597
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:29,320
Still I try, try, try, try.

1598
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:55,320
Shout out to you, shout out to you, shout out to you, shout out to you, shout out to you, shout out to you, shout out to you, shout out to you, shout out to you, shout out to you, shout out to you, shout out to you, shout out to you.

1599
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:14,320
Try to stay dry on Block Island.

1600
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:20,320
Try like a mud slide at the door.

1601
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:25,320
Well if I can just numb the pain with the room in the rain,

1602
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:33,320
I just say I don't think that I can drink much more.

1603
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:40,320
Can I get lost out on Block Island?

1604
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:46,320
Can I get lost out on Block Island?

1605
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:53,320
Can I get lost out on Block Island?

1606
01:30:53,320 --> 01:31:07,320
Can I get lost out on Block Island?

1607
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:13,320
Can I get lost out on Block Island?

1608
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:20,320
Can I get lost out on Block Island?

1609
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:23,320
Can we get lost down our love?

1610
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:26,320
Can we get lost down our love?

1611
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,320
Can we get lost down our love?

1612
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:32,320
Can we get lost down our love?

1613
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,320
Can we get lost down our love?

1614
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:38,320
Can we get lost down our love?

1615
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:41,320
Can we get lost down our love?

1616
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:45,320
Can we get lost down our love?

1617
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:48,320
Can we get lost down our love?

1618
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:51,320
Can we get lost down our love?

1619
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:55,320
Can we get lost down our love?

1620
01:31:55,320 --> 01:32:00,320
Man, such a big fan of Matthew Evil.

1621
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:03,320
Saul, this one's Eekin' Up The Charts and The Pods have Music Network.

1622
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,320
Music.podshow.com.

1623
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,320
Music.mevio.com.

1624
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:10,320
And you can include it a handy little intro there.

1625
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:13,320
Lost on Black Island, Matthew Evil on Daily Source Code.

1626
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,320
Episode 805.

1627
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:21,320
I know I'm going to sound like a broken record, but I just got to once again lay into the vaccines.

1628
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:25,320
And I want to break this down for you a little bit further than maybe I've done in the past.

1629
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:34,320
Or maybe just summarize why I'm so adamant about telling people about what's going on with vaccinations.

1630
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:42,320
Now the entire Western world has pretty much always laughed about the United States and their commercials on television.

1631
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:47,320
You ask anyone from the Continental Europe or from the United Kingdom.

1632
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:50,320
You say, how about this TV commercials for all those pills?

1633
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:55,320
And the general consensus is, in America, they got a pill for everything.

1634
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,320
You're not feeling well, you're not feeling right.

1635
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:00,320
You're not feeling happy, you're dick-done work, you're dick-done work.

1636
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:03,320
There's a pill for everything.

1637
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:06,320
And that's our pharmaceutical industry.

1638
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:09,320
And it works.

1639
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:19,320
People have been taking all kinds of pills and medication for decades, which has been pushed on them by the legal pushers of the pharmaceutical industry.

1640
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:25,320
Inclusion, of course, with government for regulation, deregulation, etc.

1641
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:34,320
Luckily, though, and I've lived on the other side of the world for many of those decades, we live at that.

1642
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:38,320
We sit here and go, party silly, freaky Americans, taking all your pills for all that chip.

1643
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:50,320
So they were never really able to expand with their medication and their magic potions and all their problem solvers and mothers, little helpers, etc.

1644
01:33:50,320 --> 01:34:03,320
And I believe that what the pharmaceutical industry has now found out successfully is that the concept of a vaccination endorsed by the government is a very, very good

1645
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:06,320
sales tool.

1646
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:09,320
So they're coming up with vaccines for everything.

1647
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:14,320
Now, of course, the motherload, the big one, is going to be for the avian bird flu.

1648
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,320
All right.

1649
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:19,320
Now, this is already in the President-elect's plans.

1650
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:28,320
He's looking to make $4 billion available for preparedness for the avian bird flu.

1651
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,320
I mean, Bush wasn't able to do it.

1652
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,320
Clinton wasn't able to do it.

1653
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,320
Maybe Barack Obama will be the President.

1654
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:42,320
It can actually give the pharmaceutical industry what they really want, which is a massive scare for avian bird flu.

1655
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,320
Oh, my gosh.

1656
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:44,320
Von Trips disease.

1657
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,320
We're all going to die.

1658
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,320
Take this shot and it'll be all cleared up.

1659
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:53,320
These guys that you're going to have in their annual reports, it's in their pipeline.

1660
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,320
What they call it?

1661
01:34:55,320 --> 01:35:03,320
In the pipeline, they've got billions of dollars that they expect to make on vaccines against avian bird flu.

1662
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:07,320
But, you know, there's a lot more to sell you in the meantime.

1663
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:12,320
So the one that I hate the most, currently, is this Gartazil.

1664
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:16,320
There's actually another similar vaccine called server acts, I believe.

1665
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:23,320
And they supposedly, they prevent cervical cancer by injecting it into nine to 13-year-old

1666
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:24,320
girls.

1667
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,320
And this is just not proven.

1668
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,320
And there's links in the show notes today.

1669
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,320
Some links that have already put in there.

1670
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:33,320
You know, it's the human papilloma virus vaccine fraud.

1671
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:38,320
But Dr. James Hollenstein, you need to read that.

1672
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:41,320
There's another link here.

1673
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:43,320
I love this one.

1674
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,320
This is a great one.

1675
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:48,320
Australian scientists to unveil skin cancer vaccine.

1676
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,320
Oh, it gets better, doesn't it?

1677
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:56,320
Professor Ian Franza told the Sunday telegraph that test of vaccine animals had proven successful

1678
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,320
and human trials could begin as soon as next year.

1679
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:03,320
Oh, they want to get the shit on the market before the quarterly report, of course.

1680
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:08,320
If we can get encouraging results, we'll try and push it on as fast as we can.

1681
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,320
He told the paper.

1682
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:14,320
Fraser, who would deliver his findings to the Australian Health and Medical Research Congress

1683
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:19,320
on Monday said a skin cancer vaccine could be available in five to 10 years, although Middle

1684
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:20,320
Data.

1685
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:25,320
It would be used on children between ages 10 and 12 to prevent them from developing skin cancer,

1686
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:34,320
a disease which causes some 1,600 deaths in Australia each year.

1687
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,320
This is the same guy, by the way.

1688
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,320
It's somewhere in here.

1689
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:46,320
Yeah, is the same guy who helps invent, oh, this is fantastic.

1690
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:52,320
The new vaccine, it says, would target a papaloma virus, a common infection that can turn abnormal cells

1691
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,320
into cancer.

1692
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:54,320
So now it's for skin cancers.

1693
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,320
Well, it's the same guy.

1694
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:00,320
Yeah, it says my entire career has been focused on understanding the interaction between

1695
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:05,320
papaloma virus and the cancers.

1696
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:11,320
This is so untested, so not right to be injecting this into our children.

1697
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:15,320
I was, and more and more people are getting on to this about the flu vaccines.

1698
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:18,320
Very good friend of mine, I had dinner with him in New York.

1699
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:22,320
And I, you know, I was talking about the show and then I started kind of laying down,

1700
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:23,320
you know, talking a little bit.

1701
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:27,320
And then I said, I'm really, this is what really pisses me off against these vaccinations.

1702
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:31,320
And he says, oh, man, his wife has MS.

1703
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,320
And she insisted on getting a flu vaccination.

1704
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:36,320
She has not walked without a cane since.

1705
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:40,320
Since that.

1706
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,320
She's a piece of audio I wanted to share with you.

1707
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,320
This is from Lou Rockwell.

1708
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,320
Because, you know, please, I'm, I'm not a medical doctor.

1709
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,320
Don't take my word for it.

1710
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,320
I'm just reading.

1711
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,320
Okay.

1712
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:50,320
I'm reading.

1713
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:51,320
I'm listening.

1714
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:52,320
I'm paying attention.

1715
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,320
I want to spread this news on to you.

1716
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:55,320
So we can actually save ourselves.

1717
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:56,320
Yeah.

1718
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:57,320
Listen to this.

1719
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:01,320
This is the Lou Rockwell show.

1720
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:02,320
This is good.

1721
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:05,320
So great today to have us our guest, Dr. Donald Miller.

1722
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,320
Don is a cardiac surgeon.

1723
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:09,320
He's professor of surgery at the University of Washington at Seattle.

1724
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:12,320
He's at Lou Rockwell.com columnist.

1725
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:13,320
Take a look at his archive.

1726
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:17,320
It's full of fascinating pieces on such things as fluoridation, AIDS,

1727
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:19,320
and other revisionist topics.

1728
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:23,320
But today I want to talk to him about his wonderful and important point about why you

1729
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:25,320
should not get a flu shot.

1730
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:27,320
Hey, Dr. Miller, tell us why.

1731
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:31,320
Well, the flu shots don't work for most people.

1732
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:32,320
And they're dangerous.

1733
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:36,320
The evidence that the flu shots help this week and has been

1734
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:42,320
discredited and the safety studies have not been carried out sufficiently.

1735
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:48,320
So that there is evidence that after the first two or three weeks when the studies have stopped,

1736
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:52,320
bad things can happen like Alzheimer's disease,

1737
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:55,320
arthritis, and various serious allergies.

1738
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,320
Yeah.

1739
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,320
And I mean, there's a lot of horrible things.

1740
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,320
Autism is being blamed for it.

1741
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:01,320
And kids are dying.

1742
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:04,320
They're absolutely dying from this.

1743
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:07,320
You know, build up some resistance.

1744
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,320
Of course, polio.

1745
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,320
I think we got that one covered.

1746
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:11,320
We got that one figured out.

1747
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:17,320
There are obviously valid vaccinations that have worked for many centuries

1748
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:20,320
before the pharmaceutical industry grew into what it is.

1749
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:25,320
And it's like, alchemy that's being performed on our children.

1750
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:29,320
And luckily there's a lot of parent groups working on this.

1751
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:32,320
It's, you know, look around for it, Google it.

1752
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:37,320
That was the girl's name was Mary to, uh,

1753
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:39,320
What's her name now?

1754
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:40,320
Just actress.

1755
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,320
She was on MTV.

1756
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:43,320
And her kid has autism.

1757
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:46,320
And she's a big spokesperson for, uh,

1758
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,320
against the flu vaccination.

1759
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,320
Man the Tory.

1760
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:52,320
By the way, if you want to put your kid into a kindergarten in New Jersey,

1761
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:55,320
and that they cannot, that is, that is unconstitutional.

1762
01:39:55,320 --> 01:40:00,320
You, you should not have to force that onto your child to have your child

1763
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:01,320
in kindergarten.

1764
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:02,320
It's not true.

1765
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,320
You should take them to court.

1766
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,320
All right.

1767
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:11,320
Well, I guess, uh, the next step is to start

1768
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:14,320
D stripping the studio here.

1769
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,320
Uh, as the move gets underway.

1770
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:18,320
Uh, you'll be a part of it one way or the other.

1771
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:22,320
And, you know, let's, let's just, let's just, let's just try and

1772
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:25,320
stay a little bit sane and, and pay attention to what's going on

1773
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:28,320
and watch watch our leaders and call them to the mat.

1774
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:30,320
That's how we started.

1775
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:31,320
Don't call us.

1776
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:34,320
We'll call you because we should be calling them.

1777
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,320

1778
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:00,320

That's just one of a couple songs in the pot set music network on that today.

1828
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:38,040
Show a little bit of low-end your quartet bouquat bouquat, why?

1829
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:39,040
Why not?

1830
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,040
Well, there you go.

1831
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:41,040
You know what?

1832
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,040
You got kids?

1833
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,040
Pay attention to them.

1834
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,760
I mean, like really pay attention to them.

1835
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:45,760
Observe their habits.

1836
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:51,120
We're observed what they're doing, observe how they interact with technology and recognize

1837
01:44:51,120 --> 01:45:01,960
that your children are yet another level in sophistication in evolution of man, okay?

1838
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:07,360
Inspire them to be creative, inspire them to be something beyond what they see on television,

1839
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:10,960
let them read a book.

1840
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:11,960
You know what?

1841
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:13,400
I'm really not down when we look at all this stuff.

1842
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:19,160
If we look at the bailouts and President-elect Obama and his promises and the economy

1843
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:23,560
and the climate and the vaccines, it's, you know what?

1844
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:24,960
Because I'm still allowed to make this show.

1845
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:28,920
I'm still allowed to speak my mind and there's still a lot of people who are waking

1846
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:33,720
up to the true reality and in general life is really beautiful.

1847
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:38,520
It sounds kind of corny, but go out, you know, sniff the flowers for a change.

1848
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:43,320
Right now, get out of your car, go walk, walk around the block, find a park, you'll

1849
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:44,320
see what I mean.

1850
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:49,320
So, enjoy that freedom, use it wisely and above all live your life with passion.

1851
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:53,320
Another fine, medium presentation, stick it in your ear.
