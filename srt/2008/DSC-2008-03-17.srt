The next generation radio contenting my ears.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We don't need not seeking treatment.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm testing his ad agree.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't want to run through.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I gotta go to the sea.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't need to run through.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Get me in the mirror now.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I don't want to run through.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let me away.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Rise and look down around.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Rock his face.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Go to the ground.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Burn it up.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Go to the road.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What's the matter?

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Go up your phone.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I call you.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't want to run through.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I make way the air.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No serenade.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No fabricates.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The platform in the air.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Come home.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What do you want?

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What do you want?

30
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't want to run through.

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's new.

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
No mirror.

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Go to the direction.

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't want to run through.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now listen to me.

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Burn it up.

37
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Burn it up.

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Get me in the mirror.

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I don't want to run through.

40
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There ain't no cure.

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
For free.

42
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Little fire.

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Go in the mirror.

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Get me in the mirror.

It's new.

51
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No mirror.

52
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Go.

53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't want to run through.

56
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000

34 coming to you from the offline summer

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I've already known as girlfriend run the west side of G-town

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and the curry manner

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's deaf-lapped rock of agents

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,800
We come all the match stuff bits in there as we expect from a go on

81
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,480
You know actually I love the intro you couldn't hear everything that that happened that mashup

82
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,200
But they start with the infamous you can't glogan blue when I look at hold on

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,680
Let me let me just you got to hear that man

84
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,920
I love that's my favorite part of any deaf leopard rucker listen to it here comes

85
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
Somewhere around here

86
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Love that I

87
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,960
Hope you had a pretty good weekend

88
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,200
We have a bit of a sick bag going on here

89
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,600
Both the lady Patricia and I are suffering just a little bit from uh, well, she's suffering much more than I am from a cough

90
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,480
Oh crap man, I can see I can figure my machine right if you hear a little bit of popping and clicking

91
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,280
Pay no attention to it. It's a known artifact

92
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,680
Yeah, um, so cough cough cough cough actually just uh Patricia went to the doctor this morning

93
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,400
It's one day morning here in the UK actually Monday afternoon. Wow. I'm gonna talk about three 41 in the afternoon

94
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
at a couple of uh

95
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,880
couple of phone calls conference calls stuff to do and a administrative work

96
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,720
Yeah, that's my uh once uh in the 60 day time to pay some bills

97
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,600
So um yeah, now poor poor Patricia and it really hits her heart

98
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,880
Because she's had pneumonia twice. I don't know if you know how severe pneumonia actually is

99
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,040
But it's really you got to watch out for that stuff

100
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,640
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna just stop this recording ever so briefly

101
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,080
I'm gonna reconfigure the buffer size so we don't have that clicking. I'll be right back in two seconds before you can even blink

102
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
I'll be back

103
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,600
Perfect. Okay. I knew it would only take a second. There we go

104
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,920
Okay, the reason why is because we said the reason why I had actually go back and reconfigure my uh my setup here is

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,040
We had a nice uh until we started to come down with this cough

106
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,520
We had a really nice nice weekend full of music

107
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,640
Remember um Patricia was talking uh actually

108
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
Well, I can't remember exactly how I came up with it. Oh, yeah

109
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
So I was thinking about doing a mashup between

110
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,840
Martha Reeves and the Van Delas heatwave and George Michaels

111
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,240
Or wham rather

112
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,440
Wham's waking me up before you go go. Hey, I got pretty far with that

113
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
But I'm not gonna play it for you because

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,480
I'm not quite sure if I can actually make it work out

115
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,560
But it did kind of fit together and I was amazed at the capabilities of able to live

116
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,360
The ability to you know pull stuff into the groove without changing the pitch or changing the pitch without actually

117
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
Changing the beats per minute

118
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,880
The beats per minute, you know what I mean right and then uh Patricia said you know, I really I need to have a song

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,600
Dutch song then I'm gonna she's gonna do with uh with the host of this

120
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,040
The Holland's got talent that she's in so somewhere in May

121
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,080
I guess when I do the do the live version of the show

122
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,120
They want to do a show together and so she said you I want to kind of base it a little bit on a combination of heatwave and wake me up before you go go

123
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,160
And I say well, that's fantastic. I've got a whole studio upstairs and I have no musical talent

124
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,360
Turns out I do and I was quite amazed at this actually

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I was able with MIDI

126
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,400
Because you know, I'm not a musician. I can't really play anything but I do understand

127
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,560
When you're working with Patricia together, I you know, I know how to put together a baseline and then figure out drums and

128
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,360
It uh I'll play a little bit of it for you home on a second

129
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,080
It's instrumental because we still haven't done this singing obviously since she was hooking up a long half the time

130
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
This this just gives an idea

131
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
Oh, listen to me play damn horns baby

132
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,000
As soon as we've done some some of the vocal tracks. I'm sure I'll play some of that for you

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,600
Hey a lot of ground to go over to cover today tons of stuff going on

134
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,960
tons of voicemail which I just haven't gotten to because well, I wanted what we do we did at a full proper

135
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:18,800
Food bar Friday the only show last week. So I had to shift what didn't have to I was more than happy to shift through a week's worth of audio feedback

136
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,320
And it looks like as an interesting stuff is coming in

137
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,400
Exciting of the evil Adam Curry for those of you who don't know

138
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,320
I remain on a secondary watch list with the US customs and border patrol part of the department of

139
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Home Security home land security

140
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Because there apparently is an Adam Curry

141
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,880
As far as I know he's from Nebraska and they aren't looking for him

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And looks like someone's found him

143
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:55,440
Hey Adam this is Johnny K call it from Kansas City and I'm calling regards to the evil Adam Curry that is terrorized in Midwest

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,720
It wasn't in Nebraska. It was in Kansas City. I called several months ago

145
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,840
And I was in one that found him on he's driving a red Chevy pickup truck with

146
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,840
Customized Todd Fobber Kansas license plates

147
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,440
And so the reason I'm calling is I'm challenging the evil Adam Curry to call him the Charlie and

148
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,880
Man up at a mid to his activities

149
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,480
So

150
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,040
Now or if anybody in Kansas City sees him take a picture of the truck and send it to you. So

151
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Anyway, let your show been a long time

152
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
Love you no homo

153
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
In it great here help you win

154
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,720
Like thank you. Thank you. I love that expression. I want him to man up. That's right evil Adam Curry from Kansas City man up

155
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,040
Driving around a red pickup truck with pod father license plates

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,320
We need to go get this guy for sure

157
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,560
I'm not gonna do any

158
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,560
Any articles because I have so many phone calls that came in just kind of blow through him also a two weeks ago

159
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,240
I was informed through podcaster.de that the daily source code can now be heard

160
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Through a German phone line

161
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,080
And so

162
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,960
Basically I have a dedicated phone number you can call it off anytime you want and you can hear the show and the quality was really good

163
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,920
I played it on the show and my question was of course, you know, is this like a premium rate phone line

164
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,440
Does it cost extra money?

165
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,760
How was this working and the comments started rolling in luckily?

166
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,120
To say it's plus no extra money. So if you go down the phone flat rate

167
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,280
I can call this number which I get from phone cards before my favorite plug-ass and I can use it. I can call my

168
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,040
Podcasts and yeah, what is the business model behind this though? That that's what I need to know because we've had

169
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,120
Systems similar to this where they would roll out at like a pre roll advertisement and I'm against that because you know

170
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,720
Unless unless I give you permission to do it you just can't do that

171
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,360
And so I think most of those initiatives just died just kind of fell by the wayside

172
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,000
So how are they making money is it really on the interchange the interconnect fees which is you know

173
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,480
It's like pennies on the hour or something like that is that how they're financing this thing, please someone let me know

174
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:37,280
I can also leave a comment by putting the stop button on the telephone and I really do like the service and

175
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,080
If you want to listen to my podcast

176
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,880
Wait before you get into the promo. That's pretty cool

177
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,520
So while you're listening you can

178
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,280
You can add a comment I guess you can record a comment through your phone by pressing the star button. I'll have to do that

179
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,360
I read somewhere else. I think maybe isn't there online documentation

180
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,520
That you can then subscribe to an RSS feed of the comments. That system. I like the best

181
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,520
I don't know how many people actually

182
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,480
We'll listen to their favorite shows on a telephone

183
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,160
I guess with you know with unlimited calling plans

184
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,440
It doesn't really hurt right so it doesn't make that much difference

185
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,200
The sound of course is still gonna be kind of limited to the was it the seven kilohertz band with

186
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,800
range that that audio that tell that the telephone uses

187
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
All right then plug you show

188
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Also the way the language

189
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,720
There's a new English podcast who is called who the fuck got me to do this?

190
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,560
You can go to

191
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,840
Brought to us

192

193
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,680
German podcast is available at

195
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
I'm 21 years old

196
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Great air hope you win

197
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,160
No, no no no no no no no no no no no sorry and

198
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,760
Bye bye. I got to listen that Brad worse show

199
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,760
That sounds pretty good

200
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,320
You know with a new version 2.5 I'm really liking it because when I go to my channels page

201
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,080
I don't have to pop open a mashboard

202
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,440
It starts playing my channel immediately so I've actually rearranged the shows and my

203
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,320
Top channel which is the one that starts playing by default

204
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,040
You can find that at adam.podshow.com

205
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,160
We're at them.btpodshow.com as you wish and

206
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
I put the New York Times

207
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Front page show in there

208
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,400
So now when I hit it it just like boom it goes

209
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,960
It starts playing that one immediately no secondary actions to pull up the mashboard and it's and everything's working again

210
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,440
It's like they blew out the system like just

211
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,480
You know it's stuck a big vacuum cleaner and pod shows Volopi and tubes

212
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
I don't know why I said that

213
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Just made sure everything was clean ready for the birth of V3

214
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,320
I'm even getting the meet the press show now which is I think they delivered on quick time

215
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,360
I love watching that

216
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,800
Hey, so it turns out that there's also a US version of of this phonecaster thing check this out for second

217
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,840
Adam

218
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,000
Dave here from Williamsport, Pennsylvania

219
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,000
You talked a little bit

220
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,600
I believe on 732 and we go to the phone casting

221
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,680
In German you are set up a sound casting in the states

222
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,720
The number is I've one zero two four eight zero three one four

223
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,320
I've one zero two four eight zero three

224
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,520
One four we I check this out a little while ago

225
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,000
If I have unlimited calling on myself home and if I'm caught with my MP free player

226
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,360
I can't go without my Charlie so I'd dial it up

227
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,800
See you later

228
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,320
Have a good day. I have him cool. Hold on second. Let me try that right now

229
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,240
Was it five one zero two four eight zero three one four

230
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Let's see what

231
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
By

232
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
role

233
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Hello

234
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,600
Yeah, that's the that's the Friday food bar show

235
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,000
cool

236
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,720
I mean it's I guess it's okay for them to plug their service

237
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,560
But even that's kind of borderline without asking me

238
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,440
So if you actually listen to the show that way if you're interested to listen to the show that way

239
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,800
Let me know that's yeah, that's kind of cool

240
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,800
Of course the UK phone line is also not been still man. I got so many different voice males to go through here check this one out

241
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,560
Hey Adam it's Kevin from sweatshirt North Carolina

242
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,920
It's not really from from the UK now is he okay North Carolina. I don't know which episode

243
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,760
Anyway, I'm doing the flash mob thing over the UK

244
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,200
Sounds like great idea, but it always sounds like you want everybody else to do it

245
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,320
I want to know are you gonna actually go out there and do it too?

246
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,280
Well, let us know

247
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Take part just hold strings

248
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,840
All right, well of course I was intending on only pulling the strings

249
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,600
But you know when I'm waiting for is someone to take the initiative

250
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,720
You know you work for us dot uh was it dot peanut butter dot com now you work for us dot

251
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,040
Man, I can't remember what the hell of the name that we I did a thug a week and a half ago

252
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,240
But I'm waiting for the for the bridge to stand up, you know

253
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,960
I'll be like the silly American fool running around

254
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,720
I'll do anything you need me to do but someone's got to start this and that's where I'm pulling the strings absolutely

255
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,160
I'm just amazed I'm amazed that that no one is as outrages as I am and by the way

256
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,360
There's a lot of crap going on in the US as well. It's just I happened to live here a momentarily

257
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,880
Hi Adam this is Justin I heard James Friday saying that we need not worry about all the video cameras in the nanny state

258
00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:00,000
As long as I obey conform and report I have nothing to worry about right yeah, I'll that's what TV tells me

259
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,000
But then through the power of stumble upon what a great tool

260
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,400
I find our friends over at DARPA have a new project called vulture

261
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,200
A plane that stays up for five years at 16 and 90 thousand feet

262
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840
That's what I call a constant surveillance

263
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,600
I sometimes feel like I'm living in the poem first they came

264
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,040
All right, man peace. Okay. I got to look that poem up now

265
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,520
Yeah

266
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,560
Boy can you imagine that a plane that can stay in the air for five years

267
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,040
What kind of bathroom facility do you need for one of them puppies, huh?

268
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
Oh

269
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,520
Hi Adam it's Matt from games. We's the longest week show we hang out with the survivors of oceanic flight

270
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:51,760
18 in the last the video game we go to war again with frontlines fuel of war and you can win one of five copies of

271
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,520
Saker superstars tennis for the 360 that's all a games result calm

272
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Oh

273
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Only as good as efficient

274
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Oh

275
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
You

276
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
You

277
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
You

278
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,040
You

279
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,040
You

280
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
You

281
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:41,840
Kind of like an opera ski bang your head against the wall. Let's get drunk through our panic party panics on the stage kind of thing

282
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,560
If you don't what I mean

283
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,960
If following up on some news that we had a couple weeks ago that the government suggested that

284
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Internet service providers

285
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Probably would have to start helping out

286
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,200
Primarily the entertainment industry and software industries tracking down people downloading illegal stuff

287
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,520
And they in fact even when further than that and spoke about a three strikes your out rule

288
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,160
Were the first time you'd get a warning note second time they would

289
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,080
Disconnect your service in the third time terminate forever and go to jail and cut your balls off

290
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,080
Well turns out this is a practice not just reserve for the eye out of the United Kingdom my friends. Oh no

291
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:38,880
I did call about absolutely about a topic about 10 episodes bill. You were talking about

292
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,040
A three strikes your rule out for downloading illegal material in the UK

293
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Well my friend I have to let you know that's actually alive and well here in the state

294
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:57,280
Just to give you the short story for me is a I have a video game as a

295
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
Four discs in it sick

296
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:06,160
By the way a lot of you complain about the the voice calls being soft. I don't have this nothing left to crank up

297
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,840
I have everything wide open on this one. It's allowed us that can get it. I'm sorry and that was installing my game

298
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,800
I know so one of my guess was damaged and didn't want to work

299
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:22,000
Well I'd be email the company that made the game as if I could get a replacement disk and they told me no

300
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,760
That's about a new set. You know that that pisses me off right there. I mean that just that's like an apple iTunes kind of deal

301
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,520
You know you bought it. It's yours, right? It's just the you know the

302
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,320
disks do get corrupt believe it or not it happens after a couple of years

303
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,440
I think they should have replaced it free if not you know for the

304
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,280
For the cost of shipping and handling tell me about that game company right off the bat first, you know

305
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,600
It's not like you know you're buying a whole new set. You just want one of the one of the disks

306
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,920
You know, I think you have a case right there forget about what it's about to say. Well I didn't like that idea

307
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,120
In order for me to buy a whole new set for a game that I already owned

308
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
So I went to one of the torn sites

309
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,080
Found

310
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,960
The torn download it's just the one disk that I made it with that be just four

311
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,400
And I went to sleep while downloading the morning when I woke up

312
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,800
On that that my internet connection had been suspended with a note saying for my internet provider

313
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,560
That I had been reported by a third party source

314
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
me downloading vitally go material

315
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,440
That my account isn't suspended until I delete set item and

316
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
Contact my internet company

317
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Now hold on a second

318
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,400
If you wake up in the morning and by the way you didn't tell us if the torn completed successfully or not

319
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,800
How did you get your email if they if they turned off your your account?

320
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,560
How did you get the the notice curious about that?

321
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,760
But you still get to their site or still get your email from their servers

322
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,000
But you couldn't go outside the network. I'd love to know

323
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,520
I contacted them and they told me that

324
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
There's a company called

325
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,560
yesterday which is the

326
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,440
entertainment software

327
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
Association. Oh, yeah

328
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:20,400
The ESA sounds a lot like the BSA which is the business software alliance I believe

329
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,440
If you call their main number they'll pick up and they'll say Microsoft could afternoon not kidding

330
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:31,040
You can try it. So I wonder if the ESA has anything to do with that with Microsoft as well was there an

331
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,480
Xbox that you were running?

332
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:41,040
Which apparently monitors these illegal downloads of games and excretion torn sites and that when they connect to you

333
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,760
And you seem to be uploading part of that game or if he's a software music video or whatever

334
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,600
They report you to your ISP trying to get your

335
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,040
Private information that way I'll probably do a bring up on charges or some sort

336
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,840
But the ISP they're only required to do one of two things

337
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,360
Either one they can give over your personal information

338
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:12,960
Which in my ISP provider did not or they can suspend your service until you deleted the item and

339
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:21,360
You notify them now the ISP did tell me that you actually have two shots if you've been reported twice

340
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,200
On your third time your service will be terminated without the ability to open up a new account

341
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,880
So in most areas that's three strikes in your house. Yeah, if you only have one ISP

342
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,000
Fortunately, I have two I haven't until he terminates

343
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,920
So just want to let you know about that go check them up. See you just look home on the weather ESA

344
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
That's much information then

345
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
But that's it

346
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Thank you very much. Yeah, I mean it

347
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
Wow, that's outrageous

348
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,680
That's absolutely outrageous. So there's an organization out there who is connecting to torrent uploaders

349
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
and

350
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,200
Sloo thing around getting IP addresses tracking them down getting the

351
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,880
ever basically reporting you threatening the ISP

352
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,840
Wow

353
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
That's pretty outrageous

354
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
Man, oh man

355
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,400
So it's gonna be I guess I still have the ongoing argument with a lady Patricia about the cameras

356
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,360
I keep telling her it's no good

357
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:41,440
Um, also I got a nice email from Libby Libby who is working here in the UK and is a consultant and I think she writes reports about

358
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,280
Alcohol abuse in the United Kingdom particularly amongst the

359
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,880
The younger demographic oops yeah

360
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
Sorry about that and

361
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,800
After it come on the show she didn't reply in time for today's recording

362
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,600
But you know, it's it's all that's all the stuff that's bugging me. It's all coming to a head

363
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,680
We're talking about everything and meanwhile you guys want something completely different from me

364
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
I don't this is

365
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,760
Flotskig in Oxford in the United Kingdom and just wondering

366
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
What are we gonna get in the Samsung tool?

367
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,360
Mm-hmm, something else on the pages and

368
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,160
I think it was for me best efforts

369
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,160
So yeah, I don't know the one

370
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,720
Oh, thank you. That's reverse of you. Oh, oh

371
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,200
Yeah, you're absolutely right. I got to do another sound seeing tour. You know what I'll do

372
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,160
Next time. Oh, you know what if if if I decide to do that game show pilot

373
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,880
I'll do a sound seeing tour something there something fun

374
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
Yeah, I'm out of ideas really and

375
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,920
Yeah, yeah, I've done just about everything I wanted to do

376
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,040
Give me some thoughts give me some ideas. Where would you like me to do a sound seeing tour be happy to do it?

377
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,560
It's it's actually a lot easier than doing a regular show

378
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,920
It's just you get backed up on voice males and stuff like that and other other

379
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
other pieces of the world to save

380
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,600
For instance, northern rock now I bring this up because of course that's the

381
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,520
The huge mortgage lender and and retail bank and the United Kingdom that got bailed out by the government

382
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,560
To the two to one hundred billion dollars with a B

383
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,000
And of course the same thing and just happened in the States

384
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,040
Bear Stearns you probably heard about it and it's funny because I know a lot of people of Bear Stearns

385
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,800
a lot of them from

386
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,480
Solomon Smith Barney

387
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,160
Who worked with us when

388
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Ron Bloom and I had our public company think new ideas they went to Bear Stearns

389
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,120
I think they were acquired by Bear Stearns and now Bear Stearns looks to be purchased by JP Morgan

390
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,320
It's like their stock dropped 90% almost down to a couple bucks

391
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
And their bankrupt essentially

392
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Bankrupt there you go

393
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,240
What is the entomology of bankruptcy?

394
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,200
Hmm

395
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
The word bank is certainly in there

396
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,880
So lots of people talking about that coming up again in the voice male comments

397
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,000
Hey good morning Adam is just seeing me answer

398
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,600
Did you see I was listening to the news this morning and heard that

399
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,120
Bear Stearns got bailed out blew up and um

400
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,360
And I just heard a quick story about it

401
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,600
So I don't think I really know the whole whole story but I can't couldn't help but

402
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,920
Think and draw a connection to your your northern rock

403
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,080
Story about how that needs to be bailed out because apparently Bear Stearns was bailed out

404
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,960
And with some taxpayer guarantee if not assistance I'm not sure how that works

405
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,520
So I'd be interested in getting educated and seeing if there aren't back parallels and why

406
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,680
Still a handle the same and or differently and north and north and rock was given the

407
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,320
The issues you had with that situation

408
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
How catch up eventually and still

409
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,120
And not listening to the day of day because my laptop got stolen and hasn't

410
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,400
Still deck around with the KSA on that and kind of pick it up, but I'll catch up. Thanks, man

411
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,400
I'm at just call

412
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,880
5102480314 get your fix on the phone no problem

413
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yes, or essentially this bail out

414
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:17,520
Is it is kind of the same thing but then it isn't exactly the same thing and let me see if I can explain it to you

415
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,520
The Bank of England is controlled by the government

416
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,280
The federal reserve is about as governmental as federal express

417
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:36,560
It's a private organization commercial organization who as the only organization have the right to print money

418
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:43,120
That's right go look it up when they were established in when I'm going to say 19 was at 1912

419
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,880
I'm gonna say

420
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,880
May was 1931 actually

421
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Yeah, it's a bunch of banks

422
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,800
Go look at the federal reserve go go see what they do they get to print the money

423
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,920
With almost no checks and balances, so when they created this fund and jumped of the seat of war

424
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,200
I can I talked about it over the weekend on no agenda number 21

425
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,960
Which you can find at curie.com or no agenda dot pot show dot com

426
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,840
You know we came to the same conclusion that essentially it's a tax

427
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
You know, it's a tax on the

428
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:21,120
American citizen or anyone who uses dollars really, but really on the American people because they just printed up 200 billion dollars

429
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,440
You know, there's no gold or anything to back that out. They just made some more papers

430
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,680
So of course that devalues our money with that was reflected in the recent lowest

431
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,640
dollar versus euro price ever

432
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,320
And

433
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
So whoa

434
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,760
Damn so in that regards it is it is indeed a

435
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,520
You know similar to the northern rock bail out except northern rock

436
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,600
Came directly from the government and they failed

437
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,880
They failed to sell it so they had to nationalize it

438
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:59,360
Which I would say probably means we can kiss most of that money goodbye for a long long time now I could sit here

439
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
For another hour and talk about this

440
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,200
But since we have an experts advanced standing by shall we just bring him in

441
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,560
He's back to talk about northern rock bear turns and more it is the New Yorker in London

442
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,240
The next 35,000 so that was the oh

443
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,240
No, no, no, no, I can't talk to you right now. I'm doing my show. Well, what kind of put this cell phone so I want to do that

444
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,320
rap

445
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,720
This is about the bank guarantees about

446
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,120
25 billion of

447
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,920
The money going to northern rock to basically protect money that's in the accounts

448
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,560
But they're going above and beyond they're going way beyond the the first 2000 or you're the first

449
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,760
What is it

450
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,000
50,000 no a 35,000 I guess in total 90% whatever

451
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,040
They go away further than that

452
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:34,080
So that you know whatever they say whatever the law states doesn't matter because they did more than that

453
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,520
Still wasn't fully covered and still doesn't compare to the US so yes right now it's the 435

454
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,200
As in northern rock say it was only 2000 and the 90% the next 35,000

455
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,480
Next thing to just put into this navigation issue. There's two things you need to go look at

456
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,480
And then come back to us one is continental insurance bank

457
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,480
1984 and the US the US

458
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,840
Nationalized eight bank yes the US

459
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,720
Nationalized continental insurance and 1984 and held about

460
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,280
70 to 80% of the stock until 94 and so bank of America

461
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,560
To go over it so go back in history

462
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,600
1984 continental insurance northern rock is nothing new the US has nationalized the bank

463
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,640
Finally the savings alone twice is of the 80 the US pumped in who knows

464
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,680
under 50, 160, 170 billion dollars

465
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,440
To bail out and support the failed saving the loans crisis so

466
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,600
Northern rock is small peanuts given

467
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,960
Constantly insurance and the savings alone again two countries separated by a common language

468
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
We don't call it maximization

469
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
US calls it bail out and

470
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,840
Pumping up and pumping up and all those other things all right hold on a second let me just say some about that

471
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,560
I'm not saying that the UK is better or worse than the states. I'm just saying okay

472
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,920
You know there was no bail out when northern rock happened

473
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,240
So I'm just saying you know and people should know of course the savings in a loan

474
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,640
What a scandal that was I didn't know about the spank you mentioned continental bank whatever

475
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,400
I didn't know about that and yes of course the regulatory

476
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,640
bodies are put in place to make sure that trade continues and

477
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,920
You know that that banks continue to to do business with each other because that of course

478
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,600
It was really happening here. It's way way beyond the so called subprime mortgage crisis

479
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,600
Now no one trusts anyone's fucking deals that's what's going on the banks don't trust each other

480
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,520
Right now I think it's the last time I look bare-sterns had a four dollar stock price JP Morgan's offering two bucks

481
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,960
That's less than what the building is worth and that they're in over there on that was it's six avenue I guess

482
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,520
So they just don't trust each other anymore. That's what's happening here and I'm not saying that you know the US is

483
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,160
Better or worse than the UK

484
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
I'm just saying

485
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
Finally on the snooping

486
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,760
I'm a little concerned and bothered by your perception of snooping

487
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,520
Stop and search if you're a Muslim or

488
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,280
Ethnic minority use in the UK since 2000

489
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,600
The terrorism act of 2000 has allowed the UK police to stop and search you for no

490
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:23,200
Reasonable cause. Oh, I hate it. Absolutely. The same is happening in Amsterdam by the way

491
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:29,040
No probable cause no reasonable cause just stop and search. Oh, yeah, and they profile

492
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:36,560
Oh, man, do they even customs? I've not I've in all the times I've come into Heathrow not once have I been asked to stop

493
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:43,200
At customs and the only people the only people I ever see and I come through Heathrow a lot

494
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,840
our Asian

495
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,480
You know I'm saying so yeah. Oh, please

496
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,480
massive massive profiling going on here and

497
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,160
I totally agree stop and search no right to protest three strikes you're out

498
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,960
So I don't care about these cameras following you and and you're the guys with suitcases and ties or jackets on

499
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,200
You know if you're a minority you can sit in the UK or

500
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,720
Necessity the cops and stop and search you. That's more insidious than any use dropping

501
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,080
Finally e-spotting grid is telecom your blood partner

502
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,800
What do you think supports the GC HQ which is a snooper in the UK

503
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,960
CT in Cheltenham

504
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,440
They supply the cabling they supply the infrastructure

505
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,840
You embed with the snoopers

506
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,840
So think about that a little bit

507
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,840
I won flying

508
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,960
Yeah, oh, nylon. What are you doing to me now, man?

509
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
Get me in trouble with my partner

510
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,600
Yeah, well listen first of all British telecom of course

511
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,800
You know they had they for years they had the monopoly on the wire

512
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,320
I think they still have the monopoly on the wires in the ground so that's just the fact

513
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,360
You know and it was it used to be a part of the government it got nationalized

514
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
Right and

515
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,480
In fact, I think that

516
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:11,840
It's probably more on paper than anything. I was talking to Ben for Ryan. He's the CEO and this is before the the new chairman came in

517
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,760
And I was talking to him. I said you know

518
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,360
Would you be interested in the chairman job you already want to be CEO when you want to go on to another gig and I and you know of course the rumor now is that he is looking for

519
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:29,120
Or usually what happens when a new chairman comes in he brings in a new CEO so that's kind of like the other shoe ready to drop

520
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,600
But I asked him about it and he said you know, I'm not allowed to become a chairman

521
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,680
I said when he's talking about said now you can only be a British national

522
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,720
British origin born and raised because there's all these secrets

523
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,360
The one you mentioned I'm sure as a part of it that that no one else but a a

524
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,120
A Brit

525
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,000
According to whatever law this is adhering to

526
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,200
It has to be a full-blown Englishman

527
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,920
So

528
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,920
I don't feel

529
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,920
I don't take offense to what you said

530
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,760
Put it that way someone's got a man as the wires. I'm sure they're doing something good

531
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,200
All right well we're on that of course the campaign now against a terror

532
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,840
Still rains in the UK radio commercials outdoor spots

533
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,720
Telling you three main things if someone is it's taking too many pictures of public buildings you should report them

534
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,720
If someone has too many cell phones with them you should report them that's a nice one or if there's any

535
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,640
suspicious activity around or near a particular dwelling or house you should report them

536
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
At

537
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,720
That doesn't sit so well with me

538
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,560
Because of course I'm doing all kinds of suspicious shit with cell phones and taking pictures and with with my home

539
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:55,360
But there is a difference apparently between this campaign against terror and the one of the 80s when the IRA were bombing

540
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:20,880
Looking to Neil's comments and and also thinking back on what James was saying also a brick and

541
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,120
You know what you don't want about please stay to make it talk about

542
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,240
The way the climate has changed and so on but the real point I want to make is about the 80s

543
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,640
About the bombings that happened in the 80s

544
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,080
The major differences that we were given a warning

545
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,320
Usually about five minutes this memory serves. I would round about this scene. I think now that's interesting

546
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,360
I do kind of recall that I was pretty young myself

547
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,000
But I do recall that the IRA bombers would typically

548
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,880
Call in a bomb threat that say a bomb is about to go off and the fucker actually would explode

549
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,880
But it was usually five to ten minutes after that

550
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,520
I remember that thanks for bringing that out when it all starts it's anything

551
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,000
Amazing

552
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But the point is the IRA actually had something to lose and that was that there was so close to it

553
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,040
They were looking for territory. I mean that we're looking for independence

554
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,840
I believe

555
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,080
So they they actually had something to lose or if he's like they don't have anything to gain at all

556
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,760
The terrorism that's happening now is the terrorism of the mines

557
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,440
There isn't in fact anything for them to win a global with it

558
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,800
The end of the day people don't just flip flop all faith and they certainly don't fit

559
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
Faith and territory

560
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
By blowing them up

561
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,600
So you know it's a completely inanimate it's not it's a I think it's a I think it's a the actual

562
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,280
What they goals are with a move point it's territory safe

563
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,520
I believe I mean

564
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,520
Pulling out of

565
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,280
But you know

566
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,000
With the whole body it's because we want that anyway so

567
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,720
It's not as if they should be for me anyway you know what I'm bloody round on you

568
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,920
I'm

569
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,920
You know

570
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,240
Yeah, I've overstayed you welcome Charles the drunkard London everybody

571
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
Yeah Charles I disagree with you

572
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,000
You know, so what we're talking about here is prevention of so-and-blowing something up

573
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,560
But it's not really the root cause it's kind of like the drinking

574
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,400
You know you don't in my mind you don't fix a teenage drinking by raising the price

575
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,960
You know that that's ridiculous why are they drinking what is the root cause of the problem?

576
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,800
And I think there's a lot to be discussed over there which I think a lot of it has to do with pure boredom probably

577
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,560
And lack of heroes and people to look up to

578
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:45,200
When it comes to the terrace why why do they want not because they don't have anything to live for

579
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,640
Or something has happened that has made their lives so horrible that they don't have anything to live for

580
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,200
Let's just go back for second. I do not believe

581
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,640
That there are people who for religious convictions have just decided they have to come and kill us

582
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,200
I just can't buy that and I don't also don't believe it's true. I think that's

583
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,880
That's something has been created by

584
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,880
government media people who shape opinions

585
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,960
But that it's you know, it's I don't think that that's the way really what's going on here

586
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,120
There's a lot of pissed off people pissed off primarily the United States and the more I look at the military

587
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,600
Industrial complex the more I start to understand it

588
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,320
You've been raping countries. What's the book?

589
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,320
Confessions of an economic hitman you must read this book listen to it on audible.com

590
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,560
Well, you can get it off iTunes. I think that comes from audible as well. It's where I bought it really easy you can buy it right now

591
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,200
Listen to that book

592
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,680
Listen to what the United States has been doing for the better part of 60 years

593
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,040
What's the other one legacy of ashes read about the CIA

594
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,360
I think we've been pissing people off

595
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,800
So maybe if we stop pissing people off we won't have to be racially profiling people to stop him from blowing shit up

596
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,760
And they'll have no reason to blow shit up

597
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,160
All right, I want to don't want to end on a downer note today. Thanks Charles by the way for calling in

598
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,640
Charles a drunk a Londoner. I'd like it when he's drunk better

599
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,400
Don't I am the root of all evil. I am the root of your drinking. There you go

600
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,040
Because he just funny of that way

601
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:33,200
I love it when I get calls like this one our buddy from Germany who I believe is from the Netherlands has

602
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,800
Made a career change and he seems to be very happy about it sales guy you've come on buddy

603
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,040
It changed keep in me slave

604

To my employer man

605

About you know my life what am I doing is it's really where I want to take my life

607
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,440
I want to make the most out of it

608
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,440
I made a list for myself

609
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,440
Companies that I would like to work for

610
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,520
I applied I got in I quit my normal job. I'm moving into a new job for June 1st

Absolutely happy about it working on my blog right now

612
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,640
Even though I'm gonna make the last money, you know, it's not such a high position as I had before

613
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,600
It's all fine. I feel free. I'm enjoying life and enjoying my family and enjoying my kids

614
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,240
Starting my own blog

No home. I love you all the time

Doesn't

622
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,480
No, it does

623
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,680
You've congratulations, dude. There's nothing more powerful than quitting a job. Don't you love that feeling?

624
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,000
I'd for St. Patty's Day. I didn't forget the I greatly assassination

625
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,240
When I reshized a burning on your daily source

626
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,920
I

627
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:24,160
Have a long-to-stagger leave leave have a long-toe slushy night

628
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,200
A long-toe girl that's leaving

00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,840
Well, you want them to fight tonight

630
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,800
Listen to my arish eyes

00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,520
Give these for the lattice chies

632
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,560
When you ever want to realize

633
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,520
All gonna do fight tonight

634
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,520
It doesn't matter

635
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,720
It doesn't matter if you're probably one

636
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,000
It doesn't matter if you're still

637
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,720
Believe it, it just is what I'm done

638
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,640
I want to see you the violent films with my friends yawning this girl friend

639
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,280
But we're gonna follow the show together

640
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,560
You can mix it up with a girl main tank

641
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,120
All the weeps and let's be

642
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,760
Somebody crack smoke, let's be friends

643
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,720
She sounds too musical

644
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,760
I'm trying to control

645
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,640
She's the first part who was a mess

646
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,440
Now she had a close head of the bed

647
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,240
Why did you see that six foot sound

648
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,200
Got a show doesn't watch the sounds

649
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,640
When the shots are burning bright

650
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,440
Dream to a women for your life

651
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,960
You'll get the shots

652
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,240
You'll run the night

653
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,600
When I reshized a burning on your daily source

654
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,800
I do go and I'll win through a show

655
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,760
We'll serve you in girl that I still know

656
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,560
It's a Friday night and it's a show that I'll

657
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,760
Rollin' and roll around on the ground

658
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,560
Under the lights of the mark each

659
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,360
The women feet are still scaling my knees

660
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,160
I was breaking my nose on the fear of the girl

661
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,320
It's special balls on the food

662
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,400
I want to listen my feet

663
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,080
But I didn't really know it

664
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,800
I was bleeding on someone and dreaming of you

665
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,200
Just this entire week, we're giving it to ourselves

666
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,440
Face and Kevin, we are ready

667
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,960
My jacket and bed and you jean glam

668
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,680
Frame, when I'm running out of shame

669
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,560
Just me and John and Frigney

670
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,520
We'll clean our soul, but we're goddamn lean

671
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,400
We're just the filing James Ford Murphy

672
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,280
We're making me laugh when I look for my teeth

673
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,400
When I misshized a burning cry

674
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,200
To your winning arms for your life

675
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,160
And then I misshized a world of nights

676
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,960
When I reshized a burning

677
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,800
In your feelings and seeing

678
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,840
It doesn't make you try and walk

679
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,640
It doesn't make you feel it's easy

680
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,360
For giving it to us one time

681
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,160
For giving it to us one time

682
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,200
titanium

683
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,800
Sounds as pumper

684
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,280
Quite cast as jumping

685
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,840
Yes, belongs to the stag alone

686
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,040
Mement, belongs

687
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,800
for gross leaving

688
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,800
from around you

689
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,520
Vaseline

690
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,520
And humans are my size

691
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,840
Coop for making you stay

692
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,800
Incredible

693
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,420
We're a real

694
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:41,420
You're the only one to swell three nights.

695
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:45,420
Yo, the iGrily assassination with Irish eyes are burning.

696
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,420
You'll also find another positive music network.

697
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,420
Thank you to Sir Jersey Todd with a name like that.

698
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,420
Of course, he could be the chairman of British telecom.

699
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:56,420
Jersey Todd passed that on to me, especially for St. Patty's day.

700
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,420
All right, everybody.

701
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,420
The week is kind of weird, but I am planning on doing as many shows as possible.

702
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,420
I'd love to do five.

703
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,420
Wouldn't that be amazing to have a full week of the Charlie's?

704
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,420
Although I did get a lot of email from people saying,

705
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,420
Thanks, man, finally I could catch up.

706
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,420
All right.

707
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:14,420
Hey, whatever you do today, specifically,

708
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:18,420
as you walk through the normal habits of what you do every single day,

709
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,420
pay attention to stuff, pay attention to people.

710
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,420
Talk to someone you haven't talked to, live your life with passion

711
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:27,420
and enjoy your freedom while it lasts.

712
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:30,420
Another pod show podcast.

713
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,420
Stick it in your ear.

714
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,420
Thank you.
