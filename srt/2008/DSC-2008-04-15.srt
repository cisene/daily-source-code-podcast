00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,760
It's time for the DSC 747, one model that has not been grounded in the last two weeks.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,760
On Father, you are clear for takeoff.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,760
This is the daily source code, the daily source code.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,760
16 million dollars worth of airplane scrapped to my ass.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,760
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,760
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,760
I'm testing his battery.

8
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:11,760
It's time for the DSC 747, one model that has not been grounded in the last two weeks.

9
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,760
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

10
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:23,760
It's time for the DSC 747, one model that has not been grounded in the last two weeks.

00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,760
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

47
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,760
Then the next generation radio advertising events in my ears.

48
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

49
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Next generation radio content in my ears.

50
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

51
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,760
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

52
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,760
Then the next generation radio content in my ear.

53
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,760
And it was just great and it's a fantastic opportunity to catch up on a couple of shows.

54
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:29,760
You know, I can really only choose one because of the amount of time and most of the shows that I listened to are indeed at least half an hour.

55
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,760
But it was great and I'm feeling really good. You should try that. You should walk around the block.

56
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,760
You know, just to secure iPods and have nowhere to go except in circles.

57
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,760
And then the next day, make sure you go around the other way.

58
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Turn left instead of right or right instead of left because that really makes your brain work that much.

59
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,760
That's not much better.

60
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,760
A lot of interesting stuff in the newspaper today.

61
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:58,760
I should tell you that I also went to hand off the insurance cover note at the dealer for Christina's car, which will be picking up tomorrow.

62
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,760
And next, I think it's Tuesday. Next Tuesday is when she has her test.

63
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,760
I really hope she gets her driver's license.

64
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,760
I think she's a pretty good driver.

65
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,760
And of course tomorrow evening, I'm sure we'll be doing some parallel parking.

66
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,760
I'll be the designated over 21 year old driver with her as we cruise around the streets of Kilford.

67
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,760
So then I picked up the papers and picked up the financial times, of course.

68
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,760
Right on the cover there, JK Rowling.

69
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,760
The author, of course, of all of the Harry Potter novels.

70
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,760
And I don't know if you've been following this. It's really interesting.

71
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:39,760
And it caught my eye, of course, because I believe that this is being misconstrued in most of the press.

72
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,760
What it looks like, it looks like a very wealthy woman who actually came from nothing herself.

73
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:54,760
Is now trying to be the man and put people down who are just fans of her books and have written stuff up and put it on a website.

74
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,760
And now they want to publish that.

75
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,760
And this is a pretty high profile case.

76
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,760
And of course, you almost automatically.

77
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,760
And I believe that's a lot of what the newsworthiness is for tabloid newspapers.

78
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Oh, you know, she's a money grubbing bad person.

79
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,760
I have to say some of the quotes coming out of her mouth are always about money in this particular context, which is unfortunate,

80
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,760
because she's actually doing something or she and Warner Brothers are doing something interesting.

81
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,760
It's a very interesting copyright case where it has always been allowed.

82
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:33,760
I believe for hundreds of years to write cross references or indexes of other literary works.

83
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,760
And there's tons of them. As an example, take the Star Trek movies and TV series.

84
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,760
And of course, there's Star Trek books as well.

85
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:49,760
And there are tons of Star Trek books that are reference works, which tell you exactly, you know, the history of James to Captain James T. Kirk,

86
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,760
all the way up through, I guess, Deep Space Nine, whatever.

87
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,760
And that is a fair use under copyright law.

88
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:04,760
And so what Warner Brothers and Rowling are saying is, it's not fair use.

89
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,760
90% of all of that is copied directly from my work.

90
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Well, that's kind of the idea.

91
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,760
You know, it's like if I were to write a Star Trek reference manual, you know, it would come, you know,

92
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,760
I'd try to be as true as possible.

93
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,760
And of course, I'd say, well, you know, Captain James T. Kirk was born on this day and this date.

94
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,760
And I used existing material to do the research and put all the work together.

95
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:40,760
And what I don't like is, is, and I presume that the financial times has accurate quotes from Miss Rowling.

96
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,760
I don't really like, oh, what is she saying? Hold on, let me just grab a person.

97
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,760
She said something, it's on the front page, big picture.

98
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Hold on, let me just find it.

99
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,760
Where's the quote from? I didn't like that. Here it is.

100
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Should it be bubbly?

101
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
No, that's not it.

102
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Should it be published the book? And this is JK Rowling speaking.

103
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,760
I will feel that carte blanche will be given to anybody who wants to make a quick bit of money.

104
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Mrs Rowling said, the idea of my readership,

105
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,760
parting with their parents hard earned cash for this, is a travesty.

106
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,760
I don't think that helps her case very much.

107
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,760
Because it's more about ownership.

108
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
I guess ownership comes down to money.

109
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,760
There's tons of other Harry Potter books that have been published.

110
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,760
And I believe they didn't have to have any kind of permission.

111
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,760
The interesting case, I think we can really keep to the facts of what's going on.

112
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,760
That should be very interesting to see what comes out of that.

113
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,760
I don't necessarily agree with Miss Rowling.

114
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,760
I think literary work should be possible.

115
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Be always got to kind of projects that I yourself.

116
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,760
If someone wrote a book about me, wouldn't that just be an unauthorized biography,

117
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,760
and wouldn't they have copied stuff from my weblog and my experiences?

118
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
Can you fight it?

119
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,760
I don't know. I just don't know if it's worth it.

120
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,760
What I do know is that it's always worth it.

121
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,760
To welcome a very special savant back into the family.

122
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,760
Let's have a word with the Nylon.

123
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Spreading the news with the smile on where the wrong old right.

124
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,760
We go polite. Let's listen for a while through the Nylon.

125
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
He is back.

126
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Hey Adam, it's the Nylon.

127
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Hey Bay and your native's country.

128
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Oh, man, sit down.

129
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
Walking back to the Pulitzer.

130
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
That's interesting.

131
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
No, no.

132
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
Yeah, I know exactly where it is.

133
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
I used to live right around the corner.

134
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,760
I guess they weren't checking passports today.

135
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
Were they that you got in the country?

136
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,760
These new savant's new shelves.

137
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,760
They're like foxes.

138
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,760
They take the territory.

139
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
A new one comes in.

140
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
Yeah.

141
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
Shine eye.

142
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,760
They're making a new york.

143
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
And now the monetary scientists.

144
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Yeah, these are excellent savant's my friend.

145
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
You're a wall.

146
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
And of course they're moving in.

147
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
And I love them.

148
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
Who would he come from?

149
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
So quick thoughts.

150
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
Yeah.

151
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
It's federal reserve.

152
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Get off of it.

153
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,760
U.S. has had 15 years of unprecedented growth.

154
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
Everyone is better off than they were five years ago.

155
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
Oh, nylon.

156
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
This is where you go off on the wrong path, my friend.

157
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
Yes, of course, unprecedented growth.

158
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
But we were headed towards oblivion.

159
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,760
And it turns out that lots of people knew that,

160
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,760
including Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the federal reserve.

161
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,760
And by the way, who has had this great 15 years?

162
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
You?

163
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
Everybody?

164
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
In general, probably.

165
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
But come on.

166
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,760
If lots of people knew that we were basically running out of runway.

167
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
And would never really have any lift off.

168
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,760
And it would just, you know, crash and burn.

169
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
I don't think you can call that a good thing.

170
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
But I'm willing to listen.

171
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Just about says always correction.

172
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
I.E. recession.

173
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
We'll get past this.

174
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
We'll be growing again.

175
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
And the 15 years will be another recession.

176
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
You know, spoken like a true bank.

177
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
I think about the Fed now.

178
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,760
But, you know, Greenspan basically did a very, very good job,

179
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
15 years as well as Clinton.

180
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
No.

181
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,760
My next subject is just no agenda.

182
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,760
You know, when nine months into the sand fair of devour act.

183
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,760
And the most groundbreaking thing he's come up with is sit down with you

184
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
and talk about nothing.

185
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
He does it on Twitter.

186
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,760
He does it on his blog.

187
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,760
He does it on the floor.

188
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
He does it on the floor.

189
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,760
Actually, you do it on the SC.

190
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,760
I don't get it.

191
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
I really don't get it.

192
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Yeah.

193
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
This is what the big announcement was.

194
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,760
You know, you know what's interesting there, Nylon.

195
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Is the audience for these shows is astronomical.

196
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
I'm not saying that I can explain it.

197
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
First of all, we're not talking about nothing.

198
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
You know, that's a false statement.

199
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,760
So that's just not true.

200
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,760
But my audience is growing again month over month.

201
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
I know that spillover from no agenda.

202
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,760
It's almost rivaling daily source code numbers.

203
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
And that happened in only 26 episodes.

204
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
And you know what I asked people all the time?

205
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Why do you listen?

206
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Why do you want to hear that stuff?

207
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
Why do you want to hear two old guys?

208
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,760
And people say they're just hooked on it.

209
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,760
They're with their main line in buddy.

210
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
And I'm the candy man.

211
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Anyway, um, not a lot to say.

212
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Because there's just a lot of crap going on here.

213
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
So about nothing.

214
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,760
The goals stand in which we don't even have anymore.

215
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
So anyway, I'm listening.

216
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
By the way, I am employed.

217
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
I never said what I'd do.

218
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,760
I'm not going to tip my hand on that.

219
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,760
But I'm around.

220
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
And listening.

221
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
And monitoring.

222
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Good night, Juan.

223
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
Okay.

224
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
All right, nylon.

225
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,760
So what you just gave me there was one minute and 40 seconds of nothing, my friend.

226
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,760
Your band from the show, if you don't start sending in something that is useful.

227
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,760
And was completely crap.

228
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,760
Nothing came out of that.

229
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
The nylon ladies and gentlemen,

230
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
New Yorker living in London, delivering nothing.

231
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
Hopefully, you'll call back in with something useful.

232
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Good morning.

233
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Hello.

234
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
Hello.

235
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
John.

236
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
John.

237
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
The A3.

238
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Just a little bit here.

239
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
Like this.

240
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
The A3.

241
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,760
The car insurance.

242
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
Yeah.

243
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
You need to avoid these 90.

244
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,760
It's a big, big ass car.

245
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Yeah.

246
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
No kidding, man.

247
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
I've been talking to a number of people about this.

248
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,760
And people have been laughing and saying, oh, mate, you just never had to deal with this.

249
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,760
And I was like, I did.

250
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
I have two cars.

251
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,760
And I got to Jaguar insurance, whatever.

252
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,760
I don't care as long as it's comprehensive.

253
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,760
And honestly, I just, I can't be bothered.

254
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Shopping around for the cheapest rate because of it.

255
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
I just don't want any restrictions.

256
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,760
I'm just like, I'm just willing to pay more for that.

257
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
But yeah, boy.

258
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
Is it a scam?

259
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
Once you really get into it.

260
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
Cool.

261
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,760
You're going to like, they're all underwritten by one of the other companies.

262
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
And they come this year, you know,

263
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
right?

264
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
I've got a hundred.

265
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
So I'll get by a hundred insurance.

266
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,760
We're going to get the hundred deal for any work that needs to be done.

267
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
And man.

268
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Yeah.

269
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,760
No.

270
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
No.

271
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
No.

272
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
So I do like church.

273
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
Okay.

274
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
But I've been stuck.

275
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
Did anyone respond?

276
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Well, I've put my car.

277
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,760
I've got a five year old runner clear.

278
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
It's similar.

279
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
I've got a death report for driving.

280
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,760
That's like 12 pounds in church.

281
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
Yeah.

282
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Yeah.

283
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
Fortunately now.

284
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
I think I'm paying for like 25 pounds a month.

285
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
But that's still going to do that.

286
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
But hey.

287
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
Anyway.

288
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Wonderful.

289
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Richard.

290
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
That's right.

291
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Yep.

292
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
Indeed.

293
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
God.

294
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
And we're so lucky, man.

295
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Because I had health insurance before Patricia got sick before her.

296
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,760
Her cardiovascular disease kicked in.

297
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Oh, man.

298
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
I'm so, so, so lucky.

299
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,080
Can you just imagine in today's day and age going out and trying to get some insurance

300
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,760
at a decent rate for a pre-existing condition like that?

301
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
Oh.

302
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
I had this in the war.

303
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,760
I can now.

304
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,760
We're talking about about insurance.

305
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
And I should let me just write down a note.

306
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,760
I need to talk to him about that on the next show, which will be over the weekend.

307
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,760
By the way, I think the delta share is coming back on Saturday.

308
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,760
So my plan was to fly.

309
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,760
Well, first I got to fly the wing commander back to Antwerp.

310
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Of course, drop him off.

311
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,760
Then I was thinking, I'd go have dinner with my banker.

312
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
Share-D.

313
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
My lovely.

314
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,760
What is it?

315
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Five foot.

316
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,760
11 tall, blonde banker.

317
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,760
I can't wait.

318
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,760
And, you know, another thing that I over-insure.

319
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
Just want to make sure I've got all the bases covered.

320
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,760
That's the best promise.

321
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,760
Yes, I was wondering if you could help me.

322
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Yes, I may have you.

323
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
I need a curry.

324
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
Do you have a curry?

325
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
Yes, you have a curry?

326
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,760
No, I don't have a curry.

327
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,760
What do you want?

328
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Oh, it doesn't matter.

329
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,760
I just need a curry soon as possible.

330
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,760
I'm going to the restaurant.

331
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
I'm going to the restaurant.

332
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,760
I have to come there.

333
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
Yes, sir.

334
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,760
You don't come to my place.

335
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Where do you live?

336
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
Pardon me.

337
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Do you live off?

338
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
Yes.

339
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,760
Well, then maybe we do a delivery bar card.

340
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
Do you want to come down to the restaurant?

341
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Yes.

342
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
How fast is your service?

343
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
Pardon me.

344
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Well, how fast can you get it through?

345
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
Do you mean a curry?

346
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,760
Yes.

347
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
And if you're not good to a court, I'd throw you.

348
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Yes.

349
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
So, what do you come down or not?

350
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
No.

351
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
Well, so, I have to bring the package to you.

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760

378
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,760

380
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760

We still put it here.

386
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760

387
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,760

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Get me a curry here.

391
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760

393
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
No, not you wanted a curry here.

394

395
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
It's company that deliver packages.

396
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,760
We make food.

397
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760

398
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,760

400
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,760
We don't deliver packages.

401
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
Do you deliver food?

402
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,760
You're beautiful.

403
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,760
Yes.

404
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
Can I put the package with the food?

405
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,760
So, I got it before we don't deliver packages.

406
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,760
But you deliver food.

407
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
What have you got against packages?

409
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760

Oh, man.

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,760
Drop.io.

414
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,760

415
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
But wow, it was that thing.

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760

417
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,760

418
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
But I just couldn't wait.

419
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,760
It's too much of an opportunity to play it today on this beautiful Tuesdays.

420
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760

I'm a baby

470
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,760
The sun finds a horizon, long shadows fetch out

471
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
But this game flies in

472
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,760
We're in the room in the corner conversation

473
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,760
I come set in the moment of meditation

474
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
The whole day is playing back in my mind

475
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,760
The world of people in the phases in this moment of time

476
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,760
It's the part where the smiles of this following in misery

477
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
It's the point to mama while others become

478
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
Haterie, where the wife is in the mind

479
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
All through all the hardest stuff

480
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
When all the scars of the sun are lighted up

481
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
It's the darkness

482
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
And they can keep the smartest

483
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,760
I learn about the spades between the close and the pharmacy

484
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,760

486
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
Still the speeds that I leave for the hardest

487
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
Everything can be taken down

488
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
Be around to the world

489
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,760
Nothing but the past it is no longer good day

490
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,760

the Olympics and um they were you know people who are protesting the Olympics and trying to

00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:16,660
rights violations it doesn't the united states uh execute people as well i think i don't know if we hit

521
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:24,820
1400 a year but uh 10% of our population is in jail and i'd say 70% of that is uh probably for

522
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:31,140
marijuana offenses i don't know that for sure i'm just thinking it's gonna be pretty high

523
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:38,660
and uh you know if we're really willing to stand up and say look you know this country is much

524
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,300
worse than ours instead of of course looking at fixing our own problems and changing our own attitude

525
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,500
which is really the way to go then you probably should just stop buying products from china

526
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,860
that will make the message very clear you don't need to write letters you don't need to do anything

527
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,580
but just stop buying products and uh it's very near and dear to the geeks hearts because a lot of

528
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,820
this stuff my friends comes from china start looking at the labels if that's what you really into

529
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:08,100
or we could start looking at ourselves and changing our own ways and maybe not pointing over to uh

530
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:14,100
to people on the other side of uh the walls of our glass house it's just a thought

531
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:20,340
hi Adam this is bird calling from Belgium i was listening to uh latest the dfc version

532
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,580
in the traffic jam because i've been spending like uh actually three and a half hours now in

533
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,860
my car just missed the things uh nice oh anyway uh i was listening to your comments about

534
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:35,460
are you're renting about a spanning or everybody having to it should be banning chinese products

535
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,020
and uh i was thinking well let me should probably ban US products because uh you're in

536
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:46,020
or the US is invading other countries yes we as you said yourself uh we should probably

537
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,100
ban Belgian products because we sell weapons if we're at this i'm from Belgium and we sell

538
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:56,020
you sell weapons that's right and you sell good chocolate which it also be outlawed but yeah absolutely

539
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:03,380
everywhere in the world like real people so it's not that simple to just simply ban uh products

540
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:08,420
that come from one or the other country the solution is not in there uh it's probably the other

541
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:14,100
way around with this word what we're talking about here is human rights and if we want to

542
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:20,260
want to be we want you human rights to be respected so maybe this is where it's coming from

543
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,860
and this is even more twisted when you think about it so the human rights i guess part of that

544
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:31,940
is is coming from uh the knowledge that a lot of this uh industrial work a lot of these factories

545
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:37,300
a lot of that work is performed by uh underage children uh under horrible circumstances people

546
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,260
are enslaved to the factories but guess what it's to make the crap it's to make all the crap

547
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:47,060
that we're buying so if it really bothers you stop buying crap it's the only solution

548
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:53,540
and boy you know did that open up and just in in in the span of a couple years huh

549
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,980
not good nothing against china uh really i don't uh because i don't think that there any

550
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:07,940
worse than we are i think inherently all humans do uh really nasty shit to each other um now they're

551
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,300
not exactly playing by our rules they're sending uh over to a toys that are poisoned with

552
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:18,980
lead and you know stuff that is just wrong but isn't that driven by our insatiable lust for more

553
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:26,020
product for more gadgets more gear more stuff is not exactly are we creating the problem ourselves

554
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:35,380
just a thought then we the best ways for me to help this country to make money like we see

555
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:41,380
china make money grow up and become a civilized girl or well another civilized but a rich or a

556
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:48,020
rich europe country um and then i would hope that civil rights would at least be respected a bit

557
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:54,420
better um obviously there's always complaints here or privacy rights with cameras and stuff

558
00:28:54,740 --> 00:29:00,500
that's the problem we have in rich countries but at least we're not being uh detained uh a

559
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:06,180
lawfully uh well and it's not what do you mean lots of people are detained unlawfully how about uh

560
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:14,820
get oh oh please that's not true i don't know what hope so uh make these third world countries

561
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:22,260
richer don't ban their products don't buy a system um okay thanks uh for all these lovely

562
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:31,220
DSC's have been listening for years now uh thirty nine years old uh male uh gray hair hope you

563
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:38,820
win uh gray hair or gray hair love the stuff love you bye. Hi my thanks appreciate it sorry about the

564
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,620
the traffic jam you're sitting in there and i do love the fact that uh the audience pretty much seems to

565
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:49,940
be 24 and up and uh lots of people have one or two kids you know we got a job we're just trying to

566
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:56,980
get by we guess what we actually we grew up we care about the world it's not amazing uh unlike

567
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,940
the president of the United States i caught this little bit off a sea span uh unfortunately i don't

568
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:08,580
have the whole um the whole speech but listen to what uh president George Bush is saying about

569
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:13,860
people like well it's like you and i my friends chuckle head to love a good conspiracy theory when

570
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:20,500
you see one let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September

571
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:26,100
the 11th malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorist themselves

572
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:35,940
away from the guilty wow so uh i i'm not quite sure how to respond to that and it and again i'm

573
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:41,700
looking for the whole speech i had this is just too little of it to put into context but let us never

574
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:51,620
tolerate never tolerate conspiracy theories shifting the blame that's not i mean whoa that's

575
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:56,020
shit let me listen to that again let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories

576
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:03,220
concerning the attacks of September the 11th malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away

577
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:08,900
from the terrorist themselves away from the guilty now i'd really like to hear the rest of what

578
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:14,100
president Bush said there because i read and i don't know this is true that the conclusion and

579
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,740
i'd like to know if he actually said the conclusion is that conspiracy theory and participation there

580
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:24,820
in is terror recruitment so if someone can find that for me the video we're audio and i want to know

581
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:32,020
if he actually said that because that's a that's a real freedom of speech issue and uh i can see a

582
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:37,780
lot of shit coming to a head right now isn't it uh Charlie Sheen isn't he doing the movie uh uh

583
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:44,020
theatrical release of loose change 9-11 loose change uh he's doing the uh the narration i think it's

584
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:52,660
funded by um mark mark human owner of the mavericks of course and uh uh a super duper a-list blogger

585
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:59,540
hmm my wonder well this will be interesting to track so uh we're gonna pay attention to that

586
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:07,140
meanwhile over here in the United Kingdom the 7 7 terrorists of course we had the over 50

587
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:17,540
parish in the streets and buses and tubes of uh of London on July 7th uh i wasn't now it's not

588
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:23,540
two years ago it was a three years ago two years ago i believe uh they've brought the uh these guys

589
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:29,780
to trial and uh they're finding them guilty and there's all kinds of amazing stuff that has come out

590
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,500
and when i'm oh here's the only thing i don't understand so you know they they they

591
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:40,500
great detail all the papers today are going into um how these uh how they had blue prints of how to

592
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:46,340
make explosives they were doing it with liquids with like hydrogen peroxide and and other stuff and

593
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:52,580
uh i don't know if um if what is being said if these blue prints actually were dangerous enough

594
00:32:54,020 --> 00:33:01,460
i'm just gonna presume they are and let's just uh say for a moment here wow uh if these guys

595
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:06,740
really were doing what is being reported good on ya to the to the forces here in the United

596
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,140
Kingdom good on you're forgetting these guys and bringing them to justice and i'd say relatively

597
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:16,100
swiftly no gitmo camps just bring these fuckers right up to the front boom here you are but what

598
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:22,660
really disturbs me is that they're denying it they're denying their guilty they're saying that

599
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:29,140
they were not planning to blow up planes in midflight that they uh we're not plotting

600
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:37,780
terrorist activities of any kind yeah so i don't understand if if you're truly um if you're truly

601
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:44,740
a terrorist if if you're radical and you want to get the message across and i think the threat of

602
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:51,220
terrorism is just as um just as bad if not worse than the actual acts itself and of course

603
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:57,460
excluding the loss of life wouldn't you say that you were they you were planning it and that you know

604
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:03,620
there's more common why these guys denying it that i just doesn't sit well with me and in a

605
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,980
way it discredits kind of a lot of what's being reported i want to know why they're saying they didn't

606
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:16,180
do it why i have you know they have videos apparently these guys shot uh you know like their

607
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:22,500
final jihad videos uh as they go off on their suicide mission and they're they're saying you know i'm

608
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,780
doing this uh of course they go through the whole uh i'm doing this for a loud deal and there will

609
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,580
be many more behind us and you slash shed blood and you know in our land and we'll shed blood in

610
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:39,060
your land and so they got all that down which also i had to say it's pretty damn incriminating if

611
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:47,700
you're making those types of videos in English no less but then why deny it savants called action

612
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:52,740
i would love to know what's going on with that hey i'm on this list in the number

613
00:34:53,540 --> 00:35:01,940
guessing number 755 and book cherry it's probably about the last part of stuff out ever here you

614
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:08,500
say with all the positive music that we have to wait i know they're mainstream band and everything

615
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:14,980
and that's something you're kind of against whole we're reverend industry and everything but

616
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:22,580
well hold on i'm not against the record industry oh stop please i'm just saying there's a

617
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:28,660
better way and all i want is to be able to create content and and play people songs without getting

618
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:34,980
sued and that was the entire mission of the pod save music network i don't hate him it's sad it's

619
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:40,740
it's literally you watch eMI's in the biggest shit you they can imagine right now five billion

620
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:47,380
uh that there that has been leveraged uh against a failed business model and well not all

621
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,780
their business models are failed the some of the licensing will work for a long long time but still

622
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:57,860
i i just don't see the value uh certainly not going up and you know those guys are going to run

623
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:03,140
into some really deep trouble mark my words but i'm not sitting here on the sidelines you know laughing

624
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:08,020
or going or anything and i don't hate him i love it when people get switched on and see that hey

625
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:14,820
wait a minute this whole idea of a 360 record deal where the record company can in essence give

626
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:22,660
away the music for free and make money on merchandise concerts and other ancillary activities which

627
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:28,180
works quite well Madonna has a deal like that jazzy just signed to a deal like that and let the

628
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,860
people enjoy the music will buy if we have got proof time and time again proof that when people

629
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:39,620
really enjoy what you're doing and you've got a good offer right this is important a good offer

630
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:44,900
look this is the record companies of course their good offer was the CD because they package up 12

631
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:50,180
or 14 songs of which maybe you only like one or two very rarely do i think you like every single

632
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:57,220
track on an album you know that was shitty offer basically and these single tracks well it's just

633
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:03,060
not the same kind of income for these guys so they got a change but i'm not against them they understand

634
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:13,140
you get your music out there you give it away for people to play and people buy it and that's just

635
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:22,500
the way it is that's a great song and a love that is positive anyway bring here hope you win

636
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:28,260
love you no more and all that gets up yeah all right thank you very much well that's true

637
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,980
buck cherries on the pod sake music network and uh it's gotten lots of pod play i noticed and i

638
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:38,180
hope that article from billboard is coming out i don't know if it's gonna be this week and in fact

639
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:43,060
i would have heard if it was this week i think it'll be next week but uh wow man i really hope that they

640
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,860
give her some space this eve who's writing this article give her some page space or she can really

641
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:53,540
delve into it this could be an interesting turning point but then again you never know

642
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,420
the best this you think it'll be so hot it'll be so it's cold

643

mashup supplier of the daily source code mashuptown.com.

653
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,300
All right, everybody so as promised, or as predicted, or as as shit as I told
