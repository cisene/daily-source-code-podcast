1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Shara Charley's 7-9 or 5.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We died, and mine's working, and the tears are rising.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Cause, great father, why'd she show that it is?

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You know, we're getting more mean, not too sad to say to their minds.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Cause of what we had as we were.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're why, more things of no one else is there, babe.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Everybody get rid of the time we survive.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
All it has to be sure is for my eyes.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We'd be clung up with it, and that's what we died.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Why's more things of no one else is there, babe?

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes, I'll tell you the chance you are.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Don't like that she's kidding, her name won't move on.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
My heart has been glad, but she'll start next door.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why does it not work?

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Just standing here for...

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
When my country and people come to our country, the bridge is famous.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And at the same time, these people don't understand.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The way they partner with hate us.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But there's this love that's gone too good job, it's feel like a place to think.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But I'm really great, it's that's it.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
They're not a crime.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But we get a guy that's helped us survive.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What did my English name strike on my eyes?

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But I've been in this dimension of mine.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
My book and this vision of mine.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We can't even take destruction from both sides.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Destruction of people, destruction of life.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm a horse of four, the hungry sick and greener.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't want the house, but I'm a need.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah, getting angry.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's a beautiful emotion, bit of anger.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We could use some more and I'm pretty pissed off myself, my friend.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
A daily source code episode number 795 coming to you from The Curricondo in San Francisco, Northern California.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,400
California. It's Wednesday evening. Um, or as we call it at, uh,

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,600
mevio HQ, we, uh, speak of the Wu bar.

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,640
So we have our company meetings used to have them on Fridays.

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Food bar Friday now. It's a Wu bar because we do my Wednesdays. And I'm dead

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,640
tired. Really am. It's, uh, 840. Uh, yeah, 845 PM. Uh, but I am officially

40
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,000
calling this Thursday show. Which means I know there will be a Friday

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,400
show only a lot of you might not get it until Saturday because of the

42
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,040
time differences. Um, I got a head cold. Uh, it's been running at, you know,

43
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,760
we get like a Petri dish, a situation in the office right now. Uh, so my

44
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,640
nose has been dripping all day. I got a headache and they're within

45
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,080
incredibly busy. I'll be talking about that later on in this program.

46
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,160
Not not, um, um, um, this may not be a very long, uh, D. S. C.

47
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,080
Only never know. I seem to, uh, have a knack of expanding on things a bit.

48
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,880
But there's really just a couple of things that we have to talk about.

49
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,200
But of course, right off the bat, um, we know now that the Senate has passed the

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,560
bailout package. I believe 74 to 25, uh, I think was the final count. Um,

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,280
so what a great strategy, huh? What a fantastic way to do it. First, we try to

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,840
we come up, uh, uh, we meaning, uh, the true masters of the universe trying to

53
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,240
create a fourth branch of government with a, uh, a three pageer that said,

54
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,440
hey, give us all the power. This is our real intent. Of course, everyone

55
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,280
walks at that and then we, uh, we adapt it. Oh, we got to hurry up. We got to rush.

56
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,320
We got to suspend the rules. That's a form of a martial law, uh,

57
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,240
under which the Congress, the House representatives were, um, we're operating, um,

58
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,960
this dispute over the actual term martial law. But there was a

59
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,680
suspension of rules. So there were no committees. It didn't go through the

60
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,360
typical process because if we don't get this thing signed, then we're all going to

61
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,240
die. Which, of course, hasn't happened yet, uh, even though nothing has

62
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,680
been passed. And, uh, yeah, sure, we saw a 778 point drop. But, uh, it's still

63
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,800
was above way above, uh, 10,000. It's still above 11,000, the doubt. This is not,

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,040
the, um, the stock market. I talked with Johnson to work about this all the time.

65
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,120
The stock market is not necessarily an indicator of the economy, okay?

66
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,640
It's how it's an index of, of stocks, of industrial stocks that make stuff. So that

67
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,880
does relate in a way to the economy. But it doesn't mean necessarily that, oh,

68
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,600
you, meaning you and I lost at over a trillion dollars. Man, the lies are outrageous.

69
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,240
The things that are being said is just, it's starting to really piss me off. So anyway,

70
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,880
so that gets beaten down, uh, by a margin of like 24, uh, votes. And, uh, so then, of

71
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,840
course, the strategy comes out. Here's what we're going to do. Now we're going to pull

72
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,760
in the senators. We're going to have another version of the bill, which I have not read.

73
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,600
I don't even know if it's available yet. Uh, I've heard bits and pieces of what is

74
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,440
supposed to be included in it. And, uh, and of course, we bring back the presidential, uh, candidates,

75
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,520
the two leading ones. There are more in case you didn't know. It's not just those two guys you

76
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:45,280
can vote for. There are some independence, okay? Cynthia McKinney, Ron Barr, Chuck Baldwin. There

77
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,000
are more people that, uh, Americans can vote for international listeners. Please take note of that.

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,600
It's not just these two. That's the way the media plays it. Of course, the media owned by the

79
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,040
very banks that, uh, that have, have caused this situation. No one disagrees with that.

80
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,640
Because they're all saying, well, this is Wall Street and Main Street and Wall Street and Main Street

81
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,600
and Wall Street did this and we have a Wall Street that then. So we're still bailing on a bunch of

82
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:19,920
bankers. And, uh, I have had some, uh, the, the source code drop, which is Drop.io slash

83
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,520
code. Man, this thing is a treasure trove. I'm, you know, kudos to the guys who make this stuff.

84
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,600
There are small company that got just a little bit of financing. I wish them so

85
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,040
such a successful future because it's just a fabulous system. It's not really complicated,

86
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,880
but it works and people are using it in such interesting ways. And it's the first page I go to.

87
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,560
Now, when I wake up in the morning, first thing I do is I hit drop.io slash daddy source code.

88
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,680
That's where I'm getting, uh, a good overview of news. It's really, that's when I start producing

89
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,560
the show. It's the mirror. I read that thing and it's updated throughout the day. And of course,

90
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,600
I knew that the, the savants out there and there are many and you guys are expanding. The group is

91
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:09,680
growing bigger. I knew people would find stuff. And there was a link, which was Drop there to a, a very recent

92
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,960
thing was only about a week old, a very recent conference at Harvard University.

93
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:23,200
And it was, uh, believe six economists or, um, yeah, economists, I guess you can call them, um,

94
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,520
one of them even a current professor, but there was, uh, it's pretty diverse. There was a guy

95
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,960
from the World Bank. You know, the World Bank guy doesn't care about, you know,

96
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,440
Democrat Republican left or right. You know, those guys are about taking money from every single

97
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,440
country in the world, including United States. Um, and it was great. It's about an hour and

98
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,120
thirty six minutes. You have to watch this. You must absolutely watch this. And you will, if you're

99
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,960
brand new to the daily source code, not all of what they're saying may actually make sense to you,

100
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,520
but I found that, and remember, I'm just a DJ VJ, you know, the, I'm no economist. I have no

101
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:10,080
college education, um, I have, uh, uh, LICM, which is a high school, uh, education from, uh,

102
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,200
from the Dutch schooling system. Yeah, I went to school, but I didn't learn any of this stuff. I

103
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,200
wish they had taught me some of this stuff. But even with the knowledge that we've gained over

104
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,840
the past couple of, uh, months, I'd say, but really in the last few weeks, as this has started to come

105
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,640
to a head, uh, we've been, uh, predicting and talking about, uh, the financial crisis that would

106
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,840
come, then man, so much has come true, so much more than I even imagined. And just listen to the

107
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,360
words they're using. I mean, it's, uh, it's, it's financial terrorism. We're all going to die.

108
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,440
Nothing will work. It'll all be broken. They're going to lose everything. We don't actually know

109
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,400
if this is going to work this way, but it's the best shot we got. Now, this is not about the money,

110
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,040
because $700 billion. Look, it sounds like a lot of money, but I know at least personally,

111
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,720
10 billionaires. So, you know, you don't need to, you know, you don't need to small multiple of that.

112
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,200
That, that money is not, that it, it, it gets it's a huge, unfathomable amount. And before we have

113
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,720
seven, a hundred billionaires, seven hundred, what is it? Yes, seven, a hundred billionaires,

114
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:22,320
and I got to get it right. You know, there's, there's work to be done there, but it's not like

115
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,960
this money isn't out there in the world, and this isn't an outrageous amount. Although, of course,

116
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,720
it is a 10% of the, the national debt that the United States has were wanting, increased that

117
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,640
effectively. So, um, so we all know a little bit about this. When you listen to this panel speak,

118
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:45,360
you're going to be blown away. And, and, and I really buy into what they were saying, and they all kind

119
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,160
of said different versions of the same thing, which was very interesting. And I want to paraphrase

120
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,640
and kind of sum it up for you to, to wet your appetite, but you wouldn't even have to watch it,

121
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:03,680
just as I give you this kind of breakdown and lowdown. So, first of all, this economic crisis that

122
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,720
we're in, which is really based on all this bullshit that the banks created to make money

123
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,960
and to pay themselves handsomely. I mean, just look at some of those pay packages or go to the

124
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,200
South of France and take a look at those apartment buildings that are called boats that some of

125
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,440
these guys own. People are making $300 million a year. It's crazy. It's totally crazy. But, you know,

126
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,880
that was their own industry. It's an industry. It's a called the financial industry. And,

127
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,200
in fact, more of the things that was said for a foreign industry that is supposed to operate

128
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,040
really lean and mean and and be extremely effective. A lot of money sticking to the wall on the way

129
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:47,840
in, before it goes out. But, everyone's blaming these, the subprime mortgages. Again,

130
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,120
I'm paraphrasing all of this stuff, but I pretty much buy into what I heard. These people are a number

131
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:02,160
of the list of 166 economists who are saying this is not something that we should let happen.

132
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,720
This bailout package. And, by the way, just because, for those of you don't know, it's past the

133
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,680
Senate in United States. Now, it has to go back to Congress. So, they're probably going to vote

134
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,240
on it again Friday in its new incarnation. So, now, you know, now everyone's been indoctrinated and

135
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,280
we'll get to the mainstream media role in all of that in a second. Okay, so back to these theories.

136
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,360
So, what a lot of people make it sound like, it's, oh, this was poor people. This is a big

137
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,200
meme that's out there. Yeah, poor people who signed up for these loans, they could never pay for

138
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,680
and banks who, who suckered them into it. That's not necessarily true. A lot of this was

139
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,000
second mortgages. And, of course, they had these teaser rates, which is like, hey, come on in here

140
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,760
and for the first 24 months, you won't let you pay a really low interest. And, yeah, then it'll

141
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,920
go up depending on something, whatever, just sign here. And, this is marketing and advertising.

142
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,560
That's where there was a lack of regulation, obviously. But it wasn't poor people, necessarily.

143
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,640
Other than the middle class in America, which is poor, because what are we using the second

144
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,440
mortgages for? Well, to get by. You know, like, well, 24 months, maybe some nice will happen,

145
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,320
or maybe there were some medical bills that had to be paid. This is why these second mortgages

146
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:26,080
were taken out. I remember very well. In 1998, I helped a couple people who were in really,

147
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,920
really bad trouble with credit card debt. And I said, you got to consolidate and what you got

148
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,560
it, because they were up to their next. And I said, take this credit card debt. You can get a second

149
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,840
mortgages. And that, I was only talking, like, maybe that was like $8,000. And they had

150
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,840
probably, like, $30,000, not $20,000, because they'd had their house for, you know, 20 years or

151
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,520
whatever. They just didn't know how to use the instrument. So this has been going on for a long

152
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:57,120
time. But of course, at a certain point, if the middle class is taxed and there's, you know,

153
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,440
effectively, no real wage increase versus the price increases of energy and food. And then,

154
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,640
eventually, it's going to catch up to you. So that's what happened. Now, here's the, here's the

155
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,160
main thing. And this was really an eye opener for me when they discussed this. Before we had all

156
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:23,600
these complex pieces of paper and, you know, bullshit derivatives and credit default swaps.

157
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Basically, you went to a bank, you got a mortgage. And if you couldn't pay that mortgage,

158
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,040
if something happened, then you'd call up your bank and you said, hey, man, I got to sit down

159
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,840
with someone or the bank, of course, my contact. He was at, come on in and you sit down and say,

160
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,800
okay, here's the deal. I can't pay this mortgage. Here's what I can do. And then work with you.

161
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,120
Because of course, the bank would rather get their money than have to deal with a foreclosure.

162
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,680
And it doesn't mean that foreclosures didn't happen. But it was basically your bank and

163
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:01,440
there was someone there to work with you to work it out. What happened? And yes, this is a part of

164
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:11,920
deregulation and agreed is that the banks decided to split up these mortgages into little

165
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,440
bitty pieces. And I won't get into how those bitty pieces became even smaller pieces. And all of

166
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,600
sudden, you have hundreds or thousands of financial institutions, basically owning little pieces of

167
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:33,360
all of these mortgages. Excuse me. The direct result, of course, is when someone's defaulting,

168
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,040
who do you talk to? And in fact, the people who whose piece, little piece of loan was defaulted on,

169
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,400
either didn't know it because there were three stories removed in the house of cards in the

170
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:54,080
Ponzi scheme, they just, they would never actually know that that was taking place. But the bottom,

171
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,720
the bottom line. And by the way, the idea of distributing the risk of a mortgage is from a financial

172
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,880
perspective, not a bad idea, but not to the extent these guys took it. It's a bubble. I mean,

173
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:13,280
it's a huge, huge, huge Ponzi scheme house of cards, cards bubble. So there was no one to talk to.

174
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,800
So, you know, that's when stuff started to spin out of control. And of course, you know,

175
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,840
this is mainly because of these arm mortgages, adjustable rate mortgage. Again, with what they

176
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:32,000
called the teaser rate, you've heard all of these phrases. I'm sure. So these things, you know,

177
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,640
and after two years, or after three years, this shit starts to happen. And this has been happening

178
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,360
for a number of years. It's not something that just started to happen overnight. But all of a sudden,

179
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:49,040
if all these banks have built up the value of their company, and these banks have shareholders,

180
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,280
you know, it's, it used to be a really good idea to invest in a bank. Because banks are printing

181
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,800
money literally. And by the way, it's going to be a pretty good idea to invest in banks. Again,

182
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,160
depending on what happens, but you can already see Warren Buffett. And why is Warren Buffett putting

183
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:20,000
his money into banks? Okay. So he put $5 billion into Goldman Sachs. And today, he just announced

184
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,960
he put another $3 billion into GE. General Electric, one of their largest divisions is the finance,

185
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:33,680
GE finance. So basically, there's a bank. And they were also protected under the no-shorting rule,

186
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,120
which I think expires tomorrow or Friday or Monday or whatever. Now, Warren Buffett,

187
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:47,840
guy is not stupid. Why is he putting this money in? Not to help his cronies with like a

188
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,120
vote of confidence saying, oh, you know, Warren Buffett's, although I'm sure, I'm sure it's appreciated

189
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,240
that way. I warned Buffett, man, if he's putting money in, well, as Americans can certainly put

190
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,720
money into it. Yeah, one difference. Warren Buffett is a smart guy. These banks,

191
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,680
they need money. Okay. Now, it isn't the problem. There isn't money in the world to put into

192
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,360
these banks. So they can start lending to each other and lending to people and recapitalizing their

193
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,240
balance sheets. That's not the problem. The banks don't like the terms of the deal, because the

194
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,880
people that are sitting on the sidelines like China and their sovereign wealth funds are saying,

195
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,160
well, you know, hey, we don't mind putting some money in, but you're really going to have to

196
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,520
give up a piece of the pie. They don't want to do that. That's why they've come to the government.

197
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,120
It will just take it from those suckers. We'll take it from them people, one difference.

198
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,240
Warren Buffett believes me. The guy got an awesome deal. He's getting stock in these banks.

199
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:53,440
We are not getting stock in the banks. We are getting pieces of paper that if they can be

200
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,800
resold, yeah, we might make a profit, bloody, bloody, bloody, blah, but why didn't we get the same

201
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:05,760
deal as Warren Buffett? Why? Because we're being jacked around. It's financial terrorism.

202
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,560
In fact, the money that we're going to give is going to be given to the exact same people who

203
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:18,160
put themselves into this crisis in the first place. This is in the bill. This I do know

204
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,040
that the Secretary of the Treasury, Paulson, and Bernanke from the Fed, they're going to

205
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:33,120
hire Goldman Sachs, hire them outsourcing the work so that they can though buy up all of these

206
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,920
bad toxic assets, pieces of paper, computer entries, not even paper, computer entries.

207
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,120
They can buy that up and then sell that back. By the way, that's really true. They are doing

208
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,360
that in the Wall Street auction. It's something that, well, nothing ever has ever been done like

209
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,000
this. The government does know how to do auctions. They do it with the frequencies. They do it

210
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,880
with the area code. It's all kinds of stuff like that. Not for telephony, for phones.

211
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:14,400
I'd like completely like I'm so incensed about this. So that's the main. So again,

212
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,480
the amount of money. Yeah, that's a lot of money. And we should not be getting a possible

213
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,400
profit. We should be getting stock in these companies in these banks. We should be able to sell

214
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,560
back to them because we don't actually want to be owners of banks, although we already own a couple of

215
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:39,680
them. And we own AIG. Hey, 80% of that. You enjoy your insurance company there. Another version of a bank.

216
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:52,320
So it's really about the power. And if you look at the bill, at least the last version that I saw,

217
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:59,680
more bullshit, gaming the system of how decisions are made and the Congress will only have

218
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,920
10 hours to decide if the next 100 billion can go. It's all about power. It really is creating

219
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:14,240
a fourth branch of government. And again, the federal reserve is like federal express. It has nothing

220
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,760
to do with the government. It's owned by private banks. Oh, guess who? Let me see Goldman Sachs,

221
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:26,160
JP Morgan. They own the bank. They own the federal reserve. They've been given because of the federal

222
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,080
reserve act of 1913. They've been given the right to make and print the money. Dr. Ron Paul has an

223
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:39,120
excellent plan and a bill that he's putting together to abolish, well, at least they investigate first.

224
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,840
But eventually abolish the federal reserve. This should be Congress's job. We can't have and hold

225
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:51,520
anyone accountable at the federal reserve. It makes me mad. Okay. So now we're being sold, uh,

226
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:57,680
really sold into the idea. And this is what worries me because we had such a massive wave of people

227
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,320
calling emailing, writing, telling their congressmen or congresswoman, the representative,

228
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,880
no, no, no, no. I will hold you accountable for treason. And we have to do it again. We've got to go

229
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:18,160
right back at them. And we've got to tell them. And please, you've got to ignore all the bullshit that's

230
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:26,720
being told to you and put into your brain by mainstream media. Okay? Particularly, anything that has

231
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:35,040
the letters NBC in it. CNBC, MSNBC and NBC all owned by General Electric all owned by the bank.

232
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,000
You that what a huge conflict of interest. They're not even saying anymore. Well, uh, by the way,

233
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,120
we should point out that CNBC is owned by General Electric who has a stake in this whole thing.

234
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:55,040
They're not even disclosing it. So back to this, um, this panel, I was just one woman. I

235
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:01,120
think her name when my last name was Warren. Um, she said, look, what's really happening is you,

236
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,880
if you look at this whole house of cards, this Ponzi scheme, it's really like holding a thin metal

237
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,360
rod, if you will. Or maybe a saw, here they go, um, you know a saw. And you hold the saw by the handle

238
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,520
and you, and you, but you hold it flat. And if you shake the handle a little bit, what's going to

239
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,240
happen? The other end of it is going to go up and down and up and down. So when a couple of these

240
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,120
mortgages started to default, you know, that's like a little vibration. It's kind of shaking at the

241
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,920
handle into the saw. And then at the other end, at all the way down the line of these people who have

242
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,320
leveraged upon leverage upon leverage of little pieces of all these mortgages, it really starts to

243
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,160
shake up and, you know, up and down. And that's like a shock. If it happens again, then, you know,

244
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,440
while it's already shaking, you get another little vibration, what's going to happen? The other

245
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,680
end is really going to start going up and down. So they are fixing the problem at the wrong end.

246
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,400
Forget forget about all the power grab and forget it because it is a real problem.

247
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,760
Forget about the power grab and the money and the executives who will steal the money,

248
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,160
they will steal it. They'll all get, look, they've all got their houses in, in foreign countries.

249
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,520
I don't give a shit about you and I. This is going to take our money and get out.

250
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,000
This news about every single day. I don't even have to tell you. Just go look at the drop.

251
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,880
You'll see it all. So how about, um, we freeze the adjustable rate mortgage rate

252
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,320
bring them back to their teaser rates. That would be one way to do it.

253
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:30,640
Career, simple solution. It would even cost any money. It's a whole bunch of things that could

254
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,640
be done. But we're now being sold into this and it's, they're just propagating the hype

255
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:46,400
by companies who are, our, our licensed broadcasters who are now not even disclosing

256
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,680
their conflict of interest and what they're reporting.

257
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,160
It's almost like, uh, I don't know if you, you must have seen this. It's, it's all over the place.

258
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,960
It's like song for Obama. These kids, they're so called grass roots movement. It's funny.

259
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,240
It's almost like, I keep having to think of the new seekers. You know, um, I like to teach

260
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,480
the world to sing only when they did it for Coca-Cola. I'd like to give the world a Coke.

261
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,800
That's kind of this, uh, what this Obama video is, you got to see it. I'll put a link in the

262
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,160
show notes at daily source code.com. Um, this thing, uh, and this is why I bring it up,

263
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:33,200
is produced by professionals, including Jeff Zucker, the president and CEO of, oh, NBC

264
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:41,040
universal, pretending that it's a grassroots movement. That whole thing is filled with, with, with professionals,

265
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,120
professionally produced, misusing their kids. I don't care what it's for. That's why it equated

266
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:56,240
to selling Coca-Cola. Uh, uh, so, um, please, you must contact Congress. You must tell them,

267
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,200
no, no, no, no, no, no. Because now I'm here in these, these big grand turnaround. Oh,

268
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,000
where I used to, I was getting 5,000 emails that said, no, and only one or two that said,

269
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,240
yes, now it's like 60% of the people are saying, yes, I don't believe it. I do not believe it.

270
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,800
And you know what's even worse? I just found this on the drop. The House of Representatives

271
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:27,440
is limiting emails from the public. Listen to this. Listen to this. They're limiting emails to

272
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,840
the public to prevent its websites from crashing due to the enormous amount of mail being submitted

273
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:40,080
on the financial bailout bill. They are now censoring our true interactive wave

274
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,480
communing or communicating with them. Oh, this is so big. Oh, website to crashing.

275
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:53,600
Fuck that shit. That's such bullshit. I mean, even Microsoft can can deliver

276
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,000
incredible large updates to hundreds of millions of computers around the world,

277
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,560
but our government are all powerful government. Oh, and the website is crashing.

278
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,680
All they're doing is just shutting off the communication. That, I'm so angry at this.

279
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,560
How the hell can they even justify this?

280
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,480
Link to the show notes at dailysourcecode.com for that as well.

281
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:34,240
Oh, so angry. Yeah, I'm angry. But anger is beautiful. You're allowed to be angry.

282
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:45,600
Get pissed off with me and call your representative and say, no, no to the bailout fix it another way

283
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:54,400
at the root of the problem. Not at the branches of the money tree. Everybody knows things about it.

284
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,600
It's at the pression. Everybody's out of work. We'll scare you losing the job.

285
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,160
The dollar buys a nickel's worth. Thanks in going bus, shall give us keep a gun under the counter.

286
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,400
Punks are running wild in the street. There's nobody anywhere seems to know what to do and there's no

287
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,480
inventory. You know, there is a fit to breathe. Our phone is a fit to meet.

288
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:24,000
See, watching our TV's on some local of just a dozen. Today, we had 15 houses, 63, 500 trains.

289
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,320
As if that's the way it's supposed to be. We know things about it. We're so mad.

290
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,800
They're crazy. Just like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go on anymore.

291
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,320
We're sitting in the house and going to the world. We're living in this getting smaller

292
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,720
and always says, please, at least leave us alone. And I'll live in the room. Then we have my

293
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,600
toast or my TV. My steel built in great deals. I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.

294
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,200
Well, I'm not good anymore. I want you to get mad.

295
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

296
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

297
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

298
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

299
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:02,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

300
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:10,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

301
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

302
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

303
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

304
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

305
00:29:50,320 --> 00:30:00,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

306
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

307
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:10,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

308
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

309
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

310
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,320
I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad. I want you to get mad.

311
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
I want to get mad. I want you to get mad.

312
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,940
Maybe she willm, nevin' a van, not for one-off-tri'ing.

313
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,820
It was his name.

314
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,240
I came out at the San Francisco to set up.

315
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,000
We've now implemented a wonderful device called the TriCaster.

316
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,840
It's basically television studio in a box.

317
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,520
Now our studio is not built yet, so we have basically hijacked a very small conference

318
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:19,000
room, which kind of looks like a closet, in fact, I've seen walking closets much bigger.

319
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,080
And we're using it as a studio.

320
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,880
If you've looked at mevio.com, you'll see we have these three channels.

321
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,280
We have Texture, we have Lux, and we have Bang TV.

322
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:37,600
And the first part, and really what I've done is I've said everything up to really

323
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,680
show by example how we want this network to really look and run and how anyone can

324
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:48,200
create in exactly the same network that will come later on.

325
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,960
But anyway, if you go to mevio.com or, and this is all really like data or almost

326
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,640
alpha testing on the fly, so take it with a grain of salt and forgive me if stuff doesn't

327
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,920
look right, function right, et cetera.

328
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,160
We also have TextureNetwork.com, something we've been working on.

329
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,560
It's not all updated right, but you'll kind of get a semblance and idea of what we're

330
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,800
going for here.

331
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:14,120
And it's basically the return of me to doing video segments, which is kind of interesting.

332
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,480
It's fresh every single day, and we're really bringing all of these programs and

333
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,400
episodes and shows together, including some that we've done some pretty interesting deals

334
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,400
with that haven't been announced, but you'll figure it out pretty soon when when you see

335
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,920
this all rolling.

336
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:35,160
So keep your eye out on that as I think we're on to something here, and something that

337
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,080
you can create at home using our entire infrastructure.

338
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,400
Enough said, more about that as it progresses, probably by next week, we'll have some more

339
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
conversations about it.

340
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,800
Tomorrow night, of course, in the United States at 6 p.m. San Francisco time, the vice-presidential

341
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,800
debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin.

342
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,520
Now, I'm very excited about this for a number of reasons.

343
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,960
First of all, I want everyone once again to understand, I am not a Democrat, I'm not a

344
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:07,640
Republican, I'm a constitutionalist, and that's why I supported Ron Paul.

345
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,400
I would have loved that if he could have been president.

346
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,480
He is now endorsed the independent candidates, Ron Bar, Chuck Baldwin, Cynthia McKinney.

347
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,000
They all represent individual parties, which I have not had a chance to look into entirely,

348
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,160
but I'm pretty sure that I will, and they're more independent, by the way.

349
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,680
I will make sure that I'm well informed before I cast my vote.

350
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,680
My daughter who is now 18 is also getting into the game, and she's trying to understand

351
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,680
things.

352
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,480
The way I view this, what we're seeing right now, is truly the world's greatest reality

353
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,480
show.

354
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,920
This is not a debate amongst vice-presidential candidates who are actually going to do anything,

355
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:55,960
who will run anything other than the taps in the Lincoln bedroom, same for the presidents,

356
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,120
by the way, for the presidential candidates, McKinney Obama.

357
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,120
No, it's a casting call.

358
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,480
Okay, we've had actors before, we had one of the greatest actors in America became president,

359
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,800
and we have an actor in California, although that's actually a guy who was more than an actor,

360
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,600
but McKinney Obama, Palin Biden, actors.

361
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:24,800
The true agenda, what really runs them are Wall Street, that's mainly in Obama's case,

362
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,800
although McKinney also has plenty of Wall Street money in his campaign.

363
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,360
It's the lobbyist, it's the special interest groups, it's the think tanks, and it's shadow

364
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:40,240
government, and I'd say evil people, they're running it, they're running it for their own

365
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,280
power, for their own good, and these people are just front men, and you can agree with

366
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:51,400
me or not, but I don't think any of these people would be fit to run, I wouldn't even

367
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:57,680
have run a company of mine, let alone the country of mine, but it's going to be very

368
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,840
interesting because I've been following, you know, that would so NBC as we know, they

369
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,280
totally love Obama, Fox, totally loves McCain, and you can see how there's so many

370
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:18,160
children think that gets me, though, is how can NBC, so as a, you know, all of the different

371
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:25,120
companies, but it all comes back to general electric, whoever's in all that, they're running

372
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,960
it, it's amazing to me how they say, well, you know, Palin, she's so stupid, she's not fit,

373
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:38,320
she should drop out, if, if, if they're so pro Obama, why, why would they want, to help

374
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:49,200
them, it makes no sense, on the other hand, Fox news, it's, it's so blatantly obvious, again,

375
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,000
it's, you know, I'm just waiting for the number to pop up on your on the screen, just like

376
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,200
big brother or, or American idol or X factor, they've been saying, Sarah Palin's got the X

377
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:09,440
factor, I, I, I, I want to call it right now, I think I really think that we'll be surprised

378
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,640
by Sarah Palin, again, I don't, I'm not a Republican, I'm not a Democrat, I don't want any of

379
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,800
these people to be in the White House, of course, we're going to have one of these teams

380
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,840
is going to be in our cage match at the world wide wrestling Federation of the United States of

381
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,400
America, so it might as well be someone who's pretty, I think that's what a lot of people are

382
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:38,080
looking at, I think Sarah Palin will surprise everybody, if they teach her to just let herself

383
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:44,640
go and just speak, because she's pretty good, she's pretty personable, now forget about if she

384
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,640
knows anything, none of these guys know anything, but what, I'm just watching it purely from

385
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,400
a show business perspective as one of the greatest television extravagances in the world watch,

386
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,080
this is truly, you know what they say, the economy awards, watch my over a billion people worldwide,

387
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:09,360
which is a lie, big lie, this is the reality show that really is watched by over a billion people

388
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:16,880
worldwide, this really is the big one, and so that's the way I view it, that's what I'm interested

389
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,000
in, and I think Sarah Palin might actually just echo head and might just actually beat out Joe Biden,

390
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,600
but purely on character and personality, and none's nothing will be about the issues.

391
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,880
They tell these people they're all at the same answers, McCain and Obama, they're all for the same

392
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:40,880
thing, the little nuances, there's no difference, and we as the American public are acting like

393
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:46,800
the same way we do with wrestling, I'm for this guy, I'm for that guy, I'm for the

394
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:54,160
hammer, I'm for the the pile driver, now I want this guy to win big brother, now this person

395
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,760
sing was much better on X-Factor, except we get a little bit more angry at each other, which is

396
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:08,080
very disheartening. So, John C. to work, and I really liked doing our analysis of the president,

397
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,720
the first presidential debate, so tomorrow after the vice presidential debate, we're going to do

398
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,240
special edition of No Agenda where we go through all the points, and of course, John will be looking

399
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,600
at everything from his vantage point, and he was probably going to be scanning all the channels,

400
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:29,840
and I'm going to be listening and watching as someone who's been in television for years and

401
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:35,520
in show business, and I'm treating it as a reality show, and you may enjoy checking that out,

402
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,840
so that'll be tomorrow after the debate, no agenda.neveo.com.

403
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:52,800
Okay, um, it's just one other thing that came in on the drop, dropped.au slash daily source code,

404
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:59,840
which freaked me out. It's a YouTube video of Cynthia McKinney, who I was talking about earlier.

405
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:06,160
This is from September 27th, speaking at the Critical Resistance 10 Conference in Oakland,

406
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:13,200
California, from two days ago. I had a woman in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. I had a woman,

407
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,000
I've never really said this in public out loud in front of a lot of cameras, and there's a lot

408
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:29,280
cameras in this room now, but I had a mother to a homey because her son had a very gruesome

409
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:43,120
test. Her son's charge by the Department of Defense was to process 5,000 bodies that had received

410
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:53,920
a single bullet wound to the head, and these were mostly males, and her son was afraid to talk

411
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,360
because he assigned a silence of her greener. So he only complained to his mother,

412
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:13,200
but the data about these individuals was entered into a pentagon computer, and then reportedly

413
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:29,120
the bodies were dumped in a swamp in Louisiana. This is as a result of the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina.

414
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:39,440
Now, I have no, and I have a verification from insiders who wished to remain anonymous

415
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:57,200
and who wished for this is true. I suspect that these were prisoners, and so you know this investigation

416
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:06,080
of the whole prison that doesn't come, is extremely important, and it should not end with just

417
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:15,520
a question of the nature of prisons in our country, but these 5,000 souls also need suggestives too.

418
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,880
There you go. The American government directly are indirectly killing its citizens.

419
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,560
Even if you're in prison, do you deserve to be executed?

420
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,800
The prison industrial complex commercial prisons, I'll venture this so get paid for those 5,000 prisoners.

421
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,800
This is me, my fellow Chaka heads. We're going to stick on it. It's an outrage.
