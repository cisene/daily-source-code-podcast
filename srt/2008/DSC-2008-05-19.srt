strapped by us, and the next generation radio contenting my ears.

9
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:39,680
That's construction, oh, even though the feet of the body spurn in, as the warm machine

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:53,480

18
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,640
to kick off a show with a brand new week of the Charlie Hello chuckle heads, his daily source code episode number

19
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,960
759 coming to you from the curry manner on the west side of G-town. It's the afternoon suburb of

20
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,880
Suri known as Gilford. This is your daily source code. Oh my goodness, it's a good to talk to y'all

21
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,800
and I apologize about about Thursday and Friday. I warned you though because I had to

22
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,960
be show business bitch to the lady Pete. She was doing yet another live show of Holland's got talent

23
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,760
and she's got one more. Wow, is this like super compressed or is just me home on let me see if I

24
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:40,080
can how's that? Let me see, let me make a little different here. Just pumping too much baby, too much

25
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:48,560
pumping, not good for you. So she had another couple of really good you actually you'll laugh at this

26
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:56,880
all right. So as most of you know the lady Patricia refuses to fly with me across the English channel

27
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,920
that portion of the North Sea known as the English channel. And last I have a safety pilot with me.

28
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,000
Now she'll fly anywhere else and she does regularly in fact we've got another trip scheduled

29
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,440
pretty soon. We're going to go down to the south coast of the UK and you know when we have a nice

30
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,480
nice day weather wise today is actually not bad. It's not super. There's a it's you know there's some

31
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:25,200
clouds a little bit overcast or they would not be a candidate. Anyway it was anything but great weather

32
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:33,200
on Thursday and I had promised to take her suitcase which of course makes the easy jet trip that

33
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,720
much more enjoyable because then she doesn't have to deal with you know just anything really just

34
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,520
you know get your boarding pass walk go through security all she's got as her handbag and she

35
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,640
gets on she gets off no waiting at the other end and like yeah that's cool so um I loaded up this

36
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:56,000
huge to me bag which took up to all of the rear seats actually in the Delta Sierra and it was

37
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,720
interesting there was no one really flying at Ferroaks on Thursday and I could you know I knew

38
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,880
it was overcast about a thousand feet and saying well well we'll see yeah we'll see how we do

39
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,560
and so I took off indeed a thousand foot cloud base and about a minute into the flight it was

40
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:20,160
400 feet 300 feet pretty much touching the ground so I wound up flying in what this known as

41
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,200
instrument meteorological conditions for just are most of the flight really until I pretty much hit

42
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,280
mid channel wow the controllers are really friendly though here in the UK when you know when they

43
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,040
know you're flying through all kinds of shit then they really do help out it was cool that a good

44
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:43,440
time actually I should have recorded that one or the or the trip back because I feel that actually

45
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,040
mentioned this on Saturday on no agenda with the Johnson of Warack I feel like I've advanced a little bit

46
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:56,880
as an aviator and I'm getting pretty close to getting ready to take my well really focusing on

47
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,960
getting my instrument rating because boy will the skies open up for me now and I cannot wait listen we

48
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,680
got so much to talk about today because of course you know not only do we have Thursday and Friday

49
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,440
where I skipped a show but of course we had the weekends you guys have been calling with so much

50
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,520
stuff I mean really and we have stuff to catch up on from the food bar that we left behind so

51
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,000
first let's uh this is very important we have to see how our quota is our doing

52
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,760
morning Adam it's John Quirk yes got here I'll just listen to know again the 31 and I'll take

53
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:35,360
a guess that you like to listen to the news quiz on BBC Radio 4 from time to time yeah sometimes

54
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,240
I'm not gonna say how I know but I think you do oh and one more thing the prostate cancer prevention

55
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:49,440
closing thing you seem to be working tirelessly to turn one of the few in this piece of pleasure

56
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:59,600
less to the ordinary man into a chore you go dog I wouldn't say it's a chore I just want to

57
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,480
make sure we all stay good and healthy as you know survey has proven that masturbating five times

58
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:13,360
a week for men will reduce the chances of contracting prostate cancer severely and boy are you

59
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,520
guys responding to it Mr. Curry Jamaican in New York here you know I wasn't just show

60
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,440
give a day and um you guys were talking about prostate cancer prevention methods and you know I

61
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,960
must say that you know lately lately I've been very much meeting my quota no I just have one

62
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:40,000
question to ask with regards to meeting his quota no does this what what if what if meeting your quota

63
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,560
involves assistance let's say you know does that count as rubbing one out as well you know I

64
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,480
think it's called cheating you make it in New York what what about if let's say you have three

65
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:00,560
or four doors a night oh no what happens then to your quota you know so that's one thing I want one

66
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,840
thing I must ask you you need to get to the bottom of this no until the things Mr. Curry I

67
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,360
figure you know you're asking for a little theme song type thing you know and you know don't

68
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,880
through the song track of my life and I found this little ditty by a guy named Shinehead that

69
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,000
but apparently if it fits me perfect okay I'll be looking out for that one Jamaican New York I

70
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,840
appreciate you calling in with your hand to the grand comment report and we've got more hey Adam it's

71
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,800
being on desert I just want to know something I just let the comment be played brooding one

72
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:42,160
effort for cancer and how many times do I have to get my stuff aired on your show before I get a

73
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:50,560
jingle I want a jingle you know that's right just myth really should do a prostate cancer

74
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,560
prevention quotient or quota jingle or a mini song or something because that wouldn't you know

75
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,560
and in the lyrics kind of explain what it's all about so we have to go through that and then

76
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,720
whenever someone has a novel way of upping their quota then we could just play the jingle that's

77
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,360
a pretty good idea I just listen and I'm sure he'll come up with something here's something cool

78
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:19,120
I played a Frank Sinatra song last Wednesday and asked you to identify the mystery producer who

79
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,640

97
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:37,680
your favorite internet politics little red I had to pop in and say I thought the rendition

98
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:48,480

folder no you've won because we all have totally shaped embrace your freedom and lives in passion

101
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:23,520
I have to go back to my shows now and I'm over on MVO under LRWH as far as the past state thing

102
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:32,240
sorry guys I have worries of rest answer so you're on your own but at least my boyfriend will

103
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:41,440
make him speakly quota have a good week everyone later for now I have a lot Terry I love you thank

104
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,280
you so much totally shaped you know so I was thinking about that and all of a sudden it hit me

105
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,880
we can pull a double whammy on this so of course we know guys you know we have to we have to

106
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,280
do the business five times a week in order to keep our prostate prevention cancer quotient or quota

107
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:07,120
up and high but indeed women have to worry about breast cancer and for that you need breast examination

108
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,440
so I think you know if if the women on the show at least five times a week will self examine themselves

109
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,800
there's even a combination to be made I mean there's things that you know two partners

110
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,120
the partners could do together and we could be a really combating cancer in new and novel ways

111
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,480
I got to think a little bit more about it but it's coming to me

112
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:41,200
the president of the United States is dead he was murdered in the morning sunlight by a four-year-old boy

128
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,440
those voices here the stories and I've been a fan of that of the seven son ever since it came out

129
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,840
and it's feels like those were the cottage days weren't they? It must have been somewhere around the

130
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,760
three hundred oh man we're almost at seven hundred and what seven hundred and sixty came believe that

131
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:00,320
really moving along hey just got some news in today about the hum and the UK banks for those of

132
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,280
you in the UK you're gonna love this remember that you know the story that I've been tracking

133
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:12,560
obviously about the Gordon Brown deciding would be okay for the UK banks to swap that is a

134
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,600
literal translation of courses to just trade for temporary basis and it's based upon a

135
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:25,440
contract to swap the debt they have for government bonds and this was the 50 billion pound deal

136
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,560
that well definitely was highlighted for a while in the papers and now in the financial times

137
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:37,440
this comes from my sister days edition yes from from Monday check this out it is now turning

138
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:44,080
out to be closer to 80 or 90 billion pounds that the treasury of the Bank of England will swap

139
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,800
for bonds and they will and get this they're also of course going to get a triple a rating

140
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,640
because hey that's government money right oh by the way let me think it's our money that's right

141
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:04,080
wow they just increased that almost twofold from 50 billion to 90 billion it seems to me that

142
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,520
these banks are probably in a little bit more trouble than than is being explained to us and I think

143
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,920
it's quite worrisome tracking it for you as always I must have received at least 20 different

144
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,880
links to the story and the picture and you there's even some video of the two planes that collided

145
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,400
in a roanoke Texas at a a private commercial airfield and people are asking how the hell is this

146
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,840
possible if you haven't seen it I'll put a link in the show notes I think there's also a picture

147
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:39,520
on the drop drop.io slash daily source code what's happened there you literacy one plane and

148
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,440
another planes landed on top of it on its wings it's landing gear isn't bedded into the wings

149
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,360
and they're just sitting on top of each other like two deformed flies mating and I know exactly

150
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,120
how this happened of course the news meeting doesn't delve into it at all it's just here's the picture

151
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,600
and oh my gosh isn't that too not amazing or no one would hurt right there they don't get any

152
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,400
any of the details so the details are as follows this airfield a roanoke which is pretty much a

153
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,120
whole bunch of hangers and an air strip which is quite common actually in the United States this

154
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,920
type of roanoke I believe is in this case is roanoke Texas and you see them in California as well

155
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,200
and it's pretty much an operating airfield that does not have a control tower so it has what we call

156
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,560
a unicom frequency and sometimes it's even shared with other airports and you'll have to identify

157
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,440
which airport you're talking about what kind of maneuvers you're making so the airport the

158
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,360
the pilots speak to each other through this unicom frequency so they can say exactly what they're

159
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,760
doing where they're coming in from if they're joining the circuit if they're planning to land

160
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,960
if someone's lining up to leave and these two pilots apparently actually even knew each other and

161
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,160
here's where the confusion came in you know obviously one pilot was ready to line up to leave to

162
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,400
depart the runway while the other one was coming and I believe he actually had a student pilot with him

163
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,960
and there was some confusion which is I'd love to hear tapes of ATC or that unicom frequency

164
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,760
they probably don't exist but what obviously happened is you know both pilots thought that the

165
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,520
other had cleared them to for use of the runway and obviously you know it was a very very

166
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,520
fortunate ending could have been a lot worse but you know these things do happen and that's why

167
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,440
controllers and in towers at all kinds of airports are quite handy because they do look out for you

168
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:31,760
and they are watching your back I received email from Derek I'm still not happy with the microphone

169
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,040
today I'm not quite sure what's going on let me let me just do this that's a little better

170
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,560
Derek Richardson from I think it's in the UK but he's all in South Africa a lot he sent me a link

171
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,280
which I must put on in the show notes for today's episode of DailySourceco.com

172
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:56,320
the title of his email is the state of South Africa and I had no idea they were so bad when you

173
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,880
see these pictures it's basically a slideshow you see the horror the actually what are they call it

174
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:10,320
this this is a this is from the times of South Africa hold on I'm going to open up the web page

175
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,560
for a second the title of the of the of the pages flames of hate oh wait a minute I'm getting

176
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,760
an arrow establishing a database connection crap oh well I hope I hope this works by the time

177
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,720
I get the show notes up because you have to see these pictures it's really horrifying and it seems

178
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:35,120
like there's some form of genocide going on or genocide maybe something is is completely

179
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:42,480
completely wrong in in South Africa and uh uh crap man how come how come one down I don't hear

180
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,440
anything about this when you do hear some stuff but it just maybe it's just too much and the

181
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,360
and the news media doesn't have enough time to to handle all of it seems like this is pretty

182
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:58,720
important then again when you look at Burma or as the the junta there say uh me and Mar or if you

183
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,160
look at China where uh where hundreds of thousands are through are being threatened with starvation

184
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:10,800
same goes for Burma by the way um it's uh oh you just get a I don't know I don't know about you I

185
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,440
just get a nasty feeling I feel really crappy and I wish I could be doing a lot more and a lot of

186
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:22,880
things seem really really unimportant really they do you know I had uh one of those uh parent uh teenager

187
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,200
conversations over the weekend and I actually hear that shit coming out of my mouth you know like

188
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,320
do you realize what's going on in the rest of the world like oh fuck sound like my parents

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,400
well you know it it's it's our responsibility we're supposed to fix the world make it better for

oh man for a second it sounded like Dion Warwick's heartbreaker but I don't think I know this one

195
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:29,920
number two oh man see what Dion is doing is he's thinking it's been too easy because I've gotten a

196
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,680
lot right recently now he's making really short clues and number three

197
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,920

198
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:53,200
stand for the answer and answer number one in this week's hit this is from 1985

199
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,760
this is fruit k my feet one more wouldn't have guessed it

200

and this is answer number three from 1988 nearly finally

206
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,040

217
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:44,960
just listening to Charlie 757 I know I'm a little behind but I didn't call it up I got a long drive

218
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:54,800

for the primary election from libertarian republican and has done try I was able to vote for

220
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:10,080
Ron Paul we know we're that went but you can make me that she was the right guy you changed my mind

221
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:18,080
me to more or less one my heart and a little of a thing on June 1st in California

222
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:24,160
don't forget you got to wear an headset when you're yacking on your cell phone driving otherwise

224
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,840
not too late things can happen you never know or can change and this one sweep in the intro

225
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,080
webs I had to record off a youtube unfortunately so it's a mono email and the wrong power revolution

226
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:11,840
no more bring our boys home to our shows we don't walk big of a man for the build the book

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh on oh oh oh oh oh dinner

231
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:38,480
We haven't followed the Constitution and the next one we are to do.

232
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,480
The system that we have today are ripping off a little glass.

233
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,480
And you imagine how good a nation we can if we can't deserve system printing on as money.

234
00:30:38,480 --> 00:31:00,480
If anyone has an MP3 of that or a pointer to where I can purchase that, please let me know.

235
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,480
I'd really like to have a high quality version of the YouTube video.

236
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:11,480
By the way, oh man, Amy, she is hot and I love her voice and that video, it's fantastic.

237
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,480
You know, Ron Paul officially is still in the in the race for the Republican nomination.

238
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,480
And as I said, anything can happen, but it doesn't really matter because the revolution has started the revolution continues.

239
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:33,480
It continues in the hearts of minds of hundreds of thousands of not millions of Americans who are waking up and understanding that there are things going on that do not make sense.

240
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,480
We need to keep our eye on because hey, these fuckers work for us, remember.

241
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,480
And I appreciate the call that came in before that. Let me see.

242
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Well, I don't want to switch back to the UK just yet. Oh, this is something I just got to just got to address real briefly.

243
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Hey, Adam, this is Paul.

244
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
Listen to DSE756.

245
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:01,480
And I heard you mentioned something about GIDs and downloading duplicates of the podcast.

246
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,480
And I use juice, like you said in your podcast.

247
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:18,480
And I have noticed probably over the last couple of weeks that the juice that I'm running in a living room that downloads video podcast has re-downloaded all of texture.

248
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Let's see where their pod show shows all of deep brief TV.

249
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,480
And the only shows that I'm noticing it on are the pod show shows.

250
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:37,480
Yeah, exactly. And there's really two aggregators that were troubled by this or pod catchers, if you will.

251
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:48,480
One is juice, formerly known as iPod or lemon. And the other one is iTunes, unfortunately. So this has been a major point of contention and props to Mixmaster Andrew Grummit,

252
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,480
who figured it out.

253
00:32:52,480 --> 00:33:00,480
I'm still waiting to find out exactly what it was. I'd like to explain it to you guys, but it was a technical error. It was something that happened with the release of the new site.

254
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:10,480
And that should have stopped by now. So now I know you were still on 7.56. So let's just keep it tally. If you're still having double downloads, let me know.

255
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
Because we definitely have to keep our eye on stuff like that.

256
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,480
Let me see. Oh, this was interesting. A couple of people sent me this.

257
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,480
Check this out. Jason the architect sent me an email. Adam, I was on Skype today.

258
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,480
And I've always had Roger Smalls on my Skype contacts. I've never seen him on until today. He popped up and I started talking to him.

259
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
Apparently, he's been to prison.

260
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,480
And he was in Guilford library looking at job sites and so on Skype.

261
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,480
He's been packing potatoes, et cetera, since he was released. He wouldn't tell me why.

262
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,480
And it's been chatting up Polish girls. Well, that sounds like the real Roger Smalls.

263
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,480
I told him we all miss him as soon as he gets a phone. He will call back into the show, Adam, for the sake of the show.

264
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,480
Buy him a phone and get the best man back on the show. Yeah, absolutely Jason Roger. Just reach out, baby.

265
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,480
Just let me know where I can send you a phone. I'll send you one of those Nokia candy bars. One of those prepaid.

266
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,480
You know, I'll have the number preprogrammed. I'd love to hear from you. I hope everything's okay.

267
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
And I hope you aren't in too much trouble, my friend.

268
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,480
You say, Matthew, I say, Matthew, you say, you're not saying you clear.

269
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
Let's call the whole thing.

270
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
Adam, what's up, brother?

271
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:30,480
You have some time with the pod. Say, we played a couple of my things. One of the things you played was Adam Curry for president.

272
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,480
And hey, what do you think was a joke or something? I'm serious, man. You can get like a lot of all of the nice president or something.

273
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:46,480
Be really cool. So, of course, I use the good old DSC number three discount code at GoDaddy.

274
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,480
And now I am the proud owner of this name. Adam Curry for president dot com.

275
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,480
And you can check it out and see where it links to.

276
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,480
But there will be no surprises. Listeners where it goes. But may again contact with me in case you'd like to.

277
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,480
You know, we'll farther with this. I like we need to start thinking about the future.

278
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,480
And you know, Adam Curry for president's very cool thing because we don't necessarily have to consider president the United States.

279
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:24,480
It could be president of the world or something like that. And I think about it. I think you can run and maybe win. Take care, brother. Bye.

280
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:52,480
The Dutch owner is the eye, a car that owned by Germany, a fairies by Dubai, our defense and arms capacity is largely based offshore.

281
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,480
Thought we're British British to the core.

282
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:04,480
We've sold a faster premium ship to Florida, of course. The sweet on Harry Ramsons and the Yanks on each piece of the Spanish owner.

283
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,480
I think that came off a channel for something that came into the drop at drop.au slash daily source code.

284
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:18,480
I think that came off a channel for something that came into the drop at drop.au slash daily source code.

285
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:33,480
I think that came off a channel for something that came into the drop at drop.au slash daily source code.

286
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:43,480
And oh, yes, there's all kinds of things going on here in Britain. Don't think all the messed up stuff that's exclusive to the United States. No, there's plenty going over on here in the UK as well, my friend.

287
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:14,480
So that's further companies who then looked to employ these people, can check it out and say, well, yes, no problem to what they think the previous employers speak for all messed up.

288
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,480
This has actually been launched by Action Against Business Crime, AADC,

289
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,480
a joint crime reduction partnership, such as British retail consulting and the home office.

290
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:37,480
Yeah, that's the thing that really bothers me that the home office is involved in this. I mean, I can certainly see where, you know, companies might think this is handy.

291
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,480
I guess it's legal, but man, to have the home office involved, that sounds wrong.

292
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:53,480
That's fucking government. Okay, what is the, the employees version of this? Oh, this, you know, basically stating what they believe that they're all really good and bad.

293
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,480
And ethically, ethnically poor activities that they believe all the companies are getting up to.

294
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:11,480
If this, if this is the other way around, and it was all full of potentially slanderers and reliable and abused information about companies, you can bet companies would stamp this into the freaking ground.

295
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,480
Why the hell are we even allowing this to be used against employees?

296
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,480
And also, because we're looking at the safest and effectively blockball people out of that are working.

297
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
How does this stand with human rights?

298
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,480
Yeah, don't you have a human right to be able to work?

299
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,480
Yeah, you have a right to work. That's for sure.

300
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,480
I'm not quite sure how human rights would fit into this.

301
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,480
What do we talk to you about that here in the UK? Is that a member of Parliament?

302
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,480
I really need to, I really need to start understanding how it works here and how it can reach out to people because this is very concerning.

303
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:53,480
And I'll tell you why, because my daughter actually may get listed in this national staff registry database.

304
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,480
So, is that what is, and a dismissal, national staff dismissal register? There you go.

305
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
I'll tell you why in a second.

306
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,480
So, dismiss me not to those who are looking for way out of ever having to work.

307
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,480
Can you use this? There's effectively a means to keep them in benefits for the rest of their life.

308
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,480
This is really fucking rotten.

309
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,480
I hope you can pick it up and actually room with it.

310
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:25,480
It's got major retail employees, including self-adjusted habits, read managed services, and H&V signed up to popular register with data.

311
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,480
First of all, information, including further grants that we held for three years, all five years in special circumstances.

312
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,480
This is absolutely malicious. I'll have to email the link to it.

313
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,480
I just cannot believe this wasn't in the fucking news.

314
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
I can't see that.

315
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,480
Actually, it wasn't the news. I did get a couple of links from folks to a BBC webpage about this.

316
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,480
But of course, that's not really big like the news the news.

317
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:57,480
The companies that are doing this seem to be retail oriented, and I think that's actually quite easy to handle.

318
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,480
Because we do need to protest. We do have to do something about stuff like this.

319
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,480
By the way, I'm sure something like this will get started in the States.

320
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
It seems like just too good of an idea.

321
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
The national staff dismissal registry.

322
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,480
Although, of course, it will be the NSCR in the States.

323
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,480
The national staff can't registry.

324
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,480
A register.

325
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,480
So here's what happened over the weekend.

326
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,480
Christina usually works Sunday at an outfit called Jack Wills.

327
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,480
Now, Jack Wills is a clothing line.

328
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,480
Very much like Abercrombie in Fitch, if you will.

329
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:45,480
So it's a big brand, very expensive, completely over-priced crap that portrays a lifestyle.

330
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
Okay, the Jack Wills lifestyle.

331
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,480
And Christina started working for them part-time only because of course you still in school.

332
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:58,480
Because she was recruited on the high street of Gilford recruited because of her looks.

333
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,480
And if you look at the staff in this store, it's nothing with beautiful children.

334
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,480
In fact, all of them going to what they call here public school, but that would be the equivalent of private school in the US.

335
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,480
So the opposite of a state school.

336
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,480
So they're all public school kids. They are all blonde.

337
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,480
Every single one of them, they're all beautiful. Have striking features.

338
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Of course, my daughter definitely has all that.

339
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,480
She was talking to us at home about, you know, how she was kind of unhappy working there.

340
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:38,480
She didn't really, you know, like the, you know, the kind of the whole Jack Wills lifestyle that seemed a little, you know, just a little superficial to her.

341
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,480
You know, kidding, if you have to buy a $300 sweater.

342
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:50,480
And then she starts to say and mention a couple other things that really caught my attention. The first one is that they also recruit ugly kids.

343
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,480
That's really what she said. They have the ugly crew as they're known internally at the store. The ugly crew.

344
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:07,480
Who are supposed to do restocking only. They're not allowed to help in the store because they're not pretty enough, which just boggles the mind that this is actually taking place in 2008.

345
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,480
And here's the kicker. Okay. So these kids get absolute minimum wage.

346
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,480
And, and I also, it turns out she's starting to contract for Christ's.

347
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,480
A contract, which I didn't know about, and I can question the legality of that, you know, she's only 17. So

348
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,480
The contract says, if you want to quit, she has to give four weeks notice.

349
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,480
For a part time Sunday job, please, don't make me laugh.

350
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,480
But here's the thing that really pisses me off. So they get paid four pounds 60, which is a minimum wage per hour.

351
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:47,480
Here in the UK. But they are obliged. It's mandatory, although not written in there. You know, stellar employment contract. It's mandatory.

352
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:54,480
That whenever they're working, they're always wearing Jack Will's clothing. Now, they don't get the clothing for free.

353
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:02,480
In fact, they have to purchase the clothing. They can use their store discount, which is a big discounts, like 75% off.

354
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:17,480
But still, they have to wear it. It has to be new clothing. It has to be the new lines. It can't be something from last month. It has to be this month. So what happens is these kids wind up spending most of their harder and money on clothing at the same fricking store.

355
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,480
And it's, it's a, it's such a horrible nasty thing to do and to absolutely make it mandatory.

356
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:32,480
It's crazy. And so Christina is like, you know, I really want to quit, but I'm, I don't want to. I'm worried. I'm afraid because I don't want them to come after me.

357
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:49,480
You know, because I have to give four weeks notice and, you know, some other kid, Dan, he wanted to quit and they made him work for two more weeks. I'm like, wait a minute. This is freaking slavery. You can't do this. So I guess my whole point at here is that she may show up on some national staff dismissal register.

358
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:57,480
Right, for working in retail, which would be, and by the way, there should be a way under the Freedom of Information Act to find out if anyone's in there.

359
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:05,480
But let us not hold back from talking about the horrible practices of retail themselves. We don't need database for that. We can just say it.

360
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:16,480
And we can tell people not to go shop there because they treat workers unfairly or they report on them unfairly or they spy on them unfairly. And by the way, as much as it hurts me to say it,

361
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:25,480
we don't actually have to go and work in these stores. Let them know that they really need the workers to make all that money. They need their staff and the staff needs to be treated well.

362
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:37,480
And I can easily say this because I think I think I've been a pretty good job at treating staff very, very fairly throughout the years. And if not, let that person stand up.

363
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:51,480
So indeed, and again, helping out if there's a way to get to a minister of or a member of Parliament to discuss this and the home offices involvement by all means, let's get into it.

364
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,480
All right, what do we do on time? Let me just see what we're at.

365
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,480
Holy crap, 45 minutes. Let's go another 15 if you don't mind, because I still need to talk about fuel.

366
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,480
Hi Adam, this is spurred to going from Belgium again. I was catching up on some very source codes.

367
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:17,480
So we're in the April, I was and have ended up, and I wanted to weigh in or pitch you questions towards the responsibility on the following thing.

368
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:27,480
First, it's about oil prices. I learned from my brother, who works in the oil industry and directly that the list cost of oil.

369
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:36,480
That's like what it costs to fill up a barrel of oil is to stay at $12 dollars, roughly, around about that figure.

370
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:45,480
We're paying or on the market, they're paying over 100, what are we at, $120 and $30? Who gets this money?

371
00:45:46,480 --> 00:46:01,480
First question. Second, if the euro is growing solar towards the dollar, that should mean that oil cost and our petrol cost and Europe should be lower, no, because our euro is worth more compared to the dollar.

372
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:11,480
So we should be getting more oil for less euros, but that's also something that's not happening. We're just paying more and more and more.

373
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,480
So thanks for somebody explain it. Thank you.

374
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:26,480
All right, man. Thank you. Yeah, of course. And this is something that was explained to me very simply by John C. Devorek on no agenda, no agenda.mevio.com.

375
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:36,480
It's basically the commodities and future traders. They're ripping us off. They are completely ripping you off and the government is standing by and letting it happen.

376
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:43,480
What's going on here is whenever the dollar gets stronger, weaker, IE, the euro gets stronger, the price of oil automatically goes up.

377
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,480
Okay, because the two are linked intrinsically, I think is the right expression.

378
00:46:50,480 --> 00:47:04,480
In fact, if you really wonder the calculation, go back to 2000 and look at the euro versus the dollar. In fact, I think it was $1.2 to the euro.

379
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,480
I think that's it. Or 1.2 euros to the dollar. There you go.

380
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:16,480
And the price of oil was about per barrel about 70 euros at the time, 60 euros, actually 60 or 70.

381
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:24,480
So that's basically converting the dollar price to the euro. Now with a much weaker dollar, okay, a much weaker dollar.

382
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:30,480
But a much higher price of oil, it's still around 70 euros for a barrel of oil.

383
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:36,480
Okay, you could do these calculations. This is just roughly it's saying I'm just taking oil somewhere around $11020.

384
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:45,480
So that shows you that there is a margin in there. There's money to be made by basically selling the dollar and buying oil.

385
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,480
Or you can reverse that and sell the oil and buy the dollar.

386
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,480
And you can basically make money on the way up and on the way down. And that's exactly what happened.

387
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:01,480
This is what guys like nylon are doing. Notice he hasn't called in recently because this is what banks do. I'll cut them banksters.

388
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:10,480
Okay, banksters, commodity and future traders. And by the way, I can't really blame them because they're just doing their job, you know, they're making money. That's what they do.

389
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,480
But boy, I can't believe we're sitting on the sidelines and just letting it happen.

390
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:27,480
With someone please just show the public how are being ripped off because the price of diesel has doubled in Europe from 2000 to 2008 doubled.

391
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:41,480
So if the price of the raw material doing the conversion on the dollar to the euro has not changed, maybe by a euro or two, but pretty much stayed the same. Why are we paying twice as much for the end product?

392
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,480
Okay, why was very simple because you're getting ripped off.

393
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,480
So I guess now it's time to reintroduce the concept of an alternative.

394
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:59,480
Adam, both by Johnny here from New York, a couple weeks ago listeners to the Charlie may remember my lengthy screen about the D evolution of mankind.

395
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:10,480
And all this bitch and we do and all the action and the lack of action that we take. Well, when I hung up the phone I realized that I'm just part of the problem and I've done nothing to solve it.

396
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:25,480
I don't know if this was a good idea. I'll let you know in a month or so. I sold my my beloved Audi A4 with six on the floor that used to snap my head back and suck 16 miles to the gallon.

397
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,480
And I got a car that runs on straight and wasted vegetable oil.

398
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:39,480
And there's plenty of research out there about this and there's a lot of controversy whether or not it actually helps or hurts the economy. All I know is this.

399
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:50,480
Gas get $4 a gallon in New York last week and I'm paying a dollar a gallon from the Chinese lady who owns the Chinese food restaurant down at the corner.

400
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,480
So, we're going to have the car explode in a month or so, who knows?

401
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:03,480
At least some Mercedes, so I'm rolling in style. Anyway, I'll check in within a month. I can either be calling to tell you it's the greatest thing ever.

402
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:11,480
And that every chuckle head should have a car that runs on vegetable oil or I'll be back at the Audi dealership until then.

403
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,480
Well, glad you got it.

404
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:24,480
Yeah, awesome. Thank you. Hey, my next car. It's going to be a diesel and I've already seen over here in the UK. You can get this thing called the fuel pod. Actually, the fuel pod, too.

405
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:32,480
Cost 2 1 1,000 pounds. You can get it green fuels.co.uk. You can create your own biodiesel from vegetable oil.

406
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:40,480
That's, you know, we need to rebrand this stuff as well. Something like put a Chinese restaurant in your tank. Put a Chinese in your tank.

407
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,480
It is better.

408
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:51,480
Ah, that fits in perfectly with my rebranding of nuclear energy into nuclear energy, which actually isn't a rebrand. It's the way you're supposed to pronounce it, Mr. President.

409
00:50:52,480 --> 00:51:04,480
Atomic rod here, new clear power. I like it. New clear. It's a great brand name. It should work to deflect any immediate negative reactions long enough to share the rest of the story.

410
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,480
Paul, if you're listening, thank you very much.

411
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:14,480
As you know, coming up with a good brand name is only one of many steps in a process of solving customer problems.

412
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:21,480
No brand succeeds without being built on a strong foundation of performance. Fortunately, the new clear business has a lot going for it.

413
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,480
The world's reactors are now producing the energy equivalent of about 12 million barrels of oil per day.

414
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:33,480
And there is room for huge growth. There are also thousands of ships flying the world's oceans that burn oil, but could vision uranium.

415
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,480
We can just build as many plants each year as we did in the 1970s to the 1990s.

416
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,480
We can break the market power of the coal oil and gas industries in just a few years.

417
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,480
We can really make the world a cleaner place with just two or three decades worth of steady effort.

418
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,480
The notion of a long-term struggle puts some people off. They advise that we should pick the low hanging fruit first.

419
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,480
They forget that our install base of power system took many years of hard work to build.

420
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,480
The quest for a quick fix for mining of how some people approach weak control. It doesn't matter to the years to get fat.

421
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,480
They still want to remove those pounds and time for their vacation next month.

422
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:15,480
Time to get back to work building the new clear infrastructure that will make us all win by hard to protect your freedom to compute, to travel,

423
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,480
and to take long, comfortable showers to aid in the achievement of prostate prevention quarters.

424
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,480
I think it's the long, long, nice warm showers.

425
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,480
That's a little more information about you than I needed my friend.

426
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,480
Yeah, I'm still, I gotta tell you, I'm still kind of into the nuclear, the nuclear products, the whole idea.

427
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:45,480
You know, stackable waste. We know how to take care of it. We know putting in water is one way.

428
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:52,480
Of course, I'd still love to figure out if we can shoot it to the sun, shoot it to the moon, or drop it off on Mars for that reason.

429
00:52:53,480 --> 00:53:02,480
Hey, if we can get to 300 channels of stereo audio via satellite, we certainly, we should be able to throw some shit into space,

430
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,480
off towards the sun, ship it out there.

431
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,480
Stay on top of it, my friends. Oh, here's just one question I had for you guys.

432
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:23,480
This came in a while ago from Terence Daniels. Adam, do you know, or can you talk about a super network that Google plans to set up as the cable companies attempt to drive the phone companies out of business?

433
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,480
And the IT companies try to drive the cable companies out of business.

434
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,480
Interesting. I know I could love a good, good conspiracy, you know that.

435
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:39,480
So, I have not heard about a Google super network, but maybe I have something to do with those wireless frequencies they bid on, I don't know.

436
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,480
And maybe it's all those data centers they've got.

437
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,480
Why can't Google figure out what to do with our nuclear waste?

438
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,480
And why can't the President pronounce it properly?

439
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,480
Gee, wouldn't that be novel?

440
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,480
Something you don't hear very often. Actually, I don't think ever on the radio is poetry.

441
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,480
Certainly not poetry for our time.

442
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,480
And I think it is important to share that whenever possible.

443
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,480
Of course, on the media network, I actually beat up audio over here in the UK.

444
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:14,480
Today we have the slam idle podcast, which is just about the only one I'm aware of that really does any distribution of poetry.

445
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:22,480
And this one I found on the drop. The drop.io slash daily source code by a woman named Aaron Livingston.

446
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,480
And I think the title of the poem is Cassie and Ty.

447
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,480
And it's about our times, it's about our children, about our young people.

448
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,480
What they're going through. Things that we don't even take notice of.

449
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,480
Things that are happening, things that you see on the street.

450
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,480
And eyes of teenagers that we look into are hollow.

451
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,480
And we'll have a listen.

452
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,480
This is where it goes. I've got to have a story about two of my friends.

453
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,480
This is really important now because I mean, we're still a country at war, right?

454
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,480
So, and I hate how it just gets sort of pushed out of the way.

455
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,480
You know, once we're kind of like, oh, it's hard. You know, it's safe. You have same stuff every day on the news.

456
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:11,480
But it's, I mean, that shit adds up. You know, you hear just like stories coming through a couple people, you know, car bomb here, you know,

457
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,480
sneak attack there. And it's, it adds up.

458
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,480
And it's really important to remember that there are still affecting real people and real lives.

459
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:26,480
And so this is a story about a good friend of mine and her brother and their relationship.

460
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,480
As it pertains to the war. So.

461
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,480
He must know how her eyes stare at him.

462
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,480
From his unmistakable crew cut on down each brass button to polish pattern feathers.

463
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:48,480
And back up, Chris starts creases to confetti breast of patches finally landing on his name tag.

464
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:56,480
Only sometimes do they make it back up to his square jaw and on rare occasions they might meet his gaze.

465
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:06,480
But his eyes are faded, smoldering like mortar shells gone screening through house sites stored in memory reflex sense of smell.

466
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:25,480
And she wouldn't dare ask if he didn't want to tell it drips off him wanting someone to understand this first born son raised in an upper class subdivision turned college drop out left without meaning as a man and searching for approval.

467
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:35,480
He landed in Afghanistan, pride, weighing heavy as the machine gun and his soft hands and he wonders how did this happen.

468
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,480
Together, they ask the same questions.

469
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:52,480
Too many limbs lost to a cause, explained only in catch phrases. Too many bullets fired over rubble dalleys of misinformation. Too many graves dug to bury baby faces and sometimes.

470
00:56:52,480 --> 00:57:00,480
She wishes the two of them could trade places because he must know how his eyes stare at her.

471
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:16,480
From her unmistakable nodded up locks on down each protest slogan button to scuffed and muddied marching boots and back up pants of patchwork trails finally landing on her unbound breasts.

472
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:26,480
Not only sometimes, do they make it back up to her square jaw and on rare occasions they might meet her gaze.

473
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:43,480
But her eyes are faded. Too long dated by her underestimated significance of accountic cultural presence in the face of a leader who would rather see her own brother die than admit to lying about why the US went to war.

474
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:55,480
This is not a battle over who loves our country more. This is a battle over preserving our nation's values conflicted as they are.

475
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,480
Hers.

476
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,480
She doesn't really happen. I'm sorry.

477
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:29,480
Hers is exactly the type of freedom he set out to defend, but believes is a two few dial memes to an end.

478
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:45,480
And his is exactly the type of freedom she could never defend because she believes that a two brutal memes to an end to be American is complicated to say the least.

479
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,480
And to air as human we all make mistakes.

480
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:58,480
And then we all wonder why it takes so long to learn from them.

481
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:09,480
So I learned from my friend and her piece making process with next of kin together around a dinner table mediated by two loving parents.

482
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:15,480
They settle conflicts that have baffled and plagued the greatest of nations.

483
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:22,480
So God bless these heroes that they may leave my generation.

484
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,480
Thank you.

485
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:55,480
Take my hand. I heard you say depend on me.

486
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:05,480
Close your eyes. I'll lead the way. Don't disagree.

487
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:18,480
I've tried so hard to make this happen. I've lost myself.

488
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,480
Now it's pain to see.

489
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:33,480
You won't let me go. I'll give you a shot. No, I don't want it anymore.

490
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:43,480
It won't be the same. Don't do what you think I can take over.

491
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:58,480
Here we are. You have me full. You're blind to me.

492
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:04,480
So I'll lead the way. Don't let me go. I'll give you a shot.

493
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:18,480
You won't let me go. I'll give you a shot. No, I don't want it anymore.

494
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:27,480
It won't be the same. Don't do what you think I can take over.

495
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:47,480
I'll lead the way. Don't let me go. I'll give you a shot. No, I don't want it anymore.

496
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:56,480
You won't let me go. I'll give you a shot. No, I don't want it anymore.

497
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:06,480
It won't be the same. Don't do what you think I can take over.

498
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:16,480
You won't let me go. I'll give you a shot. No, I don't want it anymore.

499
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:24,480
It won't be the same. Don't do what you think I can take over.

500
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:29,480
It won't be the same. Don't do what you think I can take over.

501
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:34,480
It won't be the same. Don't do what you think I can take over.

502
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:39,480
It won't be the same. Don't do what you think I can take over.

503
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:44,480
It won't be the same. Don't do what you think I can take over.

504
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:49,480
It won't be the same. Don't do what you think I can take over.

505
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:54,480
It won't be the same. Don't do what you think I can take over.

506
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,480
It won't be the same. Don't do what you think I can take over.

507
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:04,480
It won't be the same. Don't do what you think I can take over.

508
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,480
It won't be the same. Don't do what you think I can take over.

509
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,480
Don't do what you think I can take over.
