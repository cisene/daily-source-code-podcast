00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Delta Shara Charley's 7-9-4, today is September 30, 2008.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
$60 million worth of airplane straps by us.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
To the next generation, we need to cut any of my ears.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You need not sticky turds in.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I like to think I'm flying to the street.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Look, casting is a matter of curry.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We have the chance to turn and leave us all.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We're moving right from we want to ride.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We got to make us meet before we get much older.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We're all someone's brother.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're all someone's son.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hello!

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're getting each other.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Don't know where we're gonna go.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You're the one strand of standing.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Make the noise of making clear.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Wow!

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We're not on the same side or less.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We're all someone will be alive.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's a trend.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We know we all can share together.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We'll go out and tell you how we're born

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We'll eat them, we'll eat them, we'll eat them

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, we're off someone's daughter

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We're off someone's son

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Help, give them a pretty child

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Don't know where we'll go

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't know how we're born

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We'll eat them, we'll eat them, we'll eat them

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We'll eat them, we'll eat them, we'll eat them

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, we're off someone's daughter

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We'll eat them, we'll eat them

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, we're off

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Someone's daughter

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We're off someone's son

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Help, give them a pretty child

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Don't know where we'll go

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We'll eat them, we'll eat them

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We'll eat them, we'll eat them

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, we're off someone's daughter

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We'll eat them, we'll eat them

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, we're off someone's daughter

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
As I sit here, overlooking the San Francisco Bay

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm proud to be an American man

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You're the voice, and you know it

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We won't sit in silence, we won't live in fear

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And our voice will be heard because we all are the voice

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Everybody welcome that is source code episode number 7

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
9 or 4 coming to you from San Francisco, Northern California

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
In the curry condo, it is Monday evening, 9, 30 exactly

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
On September 30th, 2008, of course, historic

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We're going down today

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sure that a lot of you are at least keeping an eye out on some of the news over the weekend

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I actually spend most of my weekend indoors

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Watching Seaspan, which is just a fantastic

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I love those fat hours

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Fantastic initiative from the cable industry

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Where's last night even I was watching

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What was going on in the floor of the house

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Watching everybody speak

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And this morning I even set my alarm

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
5am, 8am on the east coast

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So that I could see the continuation of

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, it wasn't really a debate because of course this whole thing was railroaded

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Ramrodded through I should say

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And all set up to pass

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And this is really the thing you have to understand about the way America works

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We have a representative government

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So we choose our representatives

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We can't all go and vote on things all 300 million of us

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So we choose representatives and they are supposed to go and represent

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You know my brother represent

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Which means they should be representing the general consensus of the constituents

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That each representative represents

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And not a single poll disagreed with the enormous

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Percentage of Americans who did not want to see this bill passed

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The bill by the way, which came out Sunday evening probably around

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Or actually afternoon it was around 3 o'clock

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So when I saw C and N had a copy of it

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And finally got released and 166 pages

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You know me

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I was spending quite a lot of time looking at it reading it

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Cross-referencing

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This thing was like the Lisbon Treaty man all these cross-references

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And language that really just goes beyond me

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean it was not very understandable at all

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
In fact I was still parsing it when

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
When I got an invitation to join this week in tech

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And I actually said I can't join you because I'm doing something right now

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And I was just reading this thing trying to understand it

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Wow

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You know I wondered is there anything to talk about today

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Is there any kind of news we should be discussing

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Anyway, so you've got this representation

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And very clear that the majority of Americans did not want this to pass

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
As is if we need time to think about it

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We need time to parse it we were you know being threatened

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Without any real

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Real explanation of what the the choice of not passing this bill would be

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Everyone said it would be horrible

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Now when I look at the markets

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And of course so you know by now that the

103
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 did not pass the house

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
By a nice enough margin

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Markets particularly the Dow Jones that's what I would say most people are using as the bench mark or the bill weather

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Down 770.77 points

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Still well within Dow 10,000 territories

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So it's not like everything crashed tremendously

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I think a lot of this was probably already built into the price

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The world did not come to an end and of course this is not over

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Because there will be more

112
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Trials at this they'll come back at it. They're going to do another round

113
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sure I'm not quite sure how or when or what but you better believe something's cooking

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And let me just reiterate this was from in my mind this was not really ever about the money

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
In fact by all accounts from what I can tell the 700 billion dollars was just a big number pulled out of the air

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I think it truly was about a power grab

117
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And the power grab being almost a fourth branch of government and that would have been the federal reserve the treasury and their cronies

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Where these guys all come from obviously and

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I think that that is the thing that that we did really good on by by telling our representatives look you just you just can't do this

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He just can't pass this owned by the way. There's all kinds of stuff in this bill that that I was able to parse out

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And some chuckle heads helped out on the source code drop drop that I owe slash daily source code

122
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The four instance for any further approval of funds that would only be a 10 hour period almost no debate

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'd probably these all the house committees were would be cut out again. I mean this is just it's a power grab

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's really what it is finally you know real control over our money

125
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So I'm very proud that we let our voice be heard and we stopped this again. It's not the end all the be all the end all the be all

126
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But at least you know, we were able to say unlike in the European Union I might add

127
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Hey, you know, we don't like it. I mean this was almost as good as a referendum the way television and the internet and email and all these different pieces fit together

128
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We let our voice be heard and right now we didn't want we you guys were trying to hand us and we said no and our representatives heard the call the majority of them at least

129
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And it didn't take place

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But I'm sure there's going to be a lot more to talk about a lot more to keep our eye on in the coming weeks and months as we move up towards the elections

131
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I do have a couple of things that I want to play for you

132
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Most of this obviously from from the drop. This is Representative Thaddius McCotter. He is a representative for

133
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Believe Michigan

134
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He's a Republican and I just want you to listen to this two and a half minutes about what he said on the on the floor of the house and this was today

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Talking about the depending bail out. I think he really nailed it on the head

136
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So let's just have a quick listen this of course coming from YouTube links in the show right today not to change anyone's mind

137
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But to express to my constituents my reasons for opposing this bill

138
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
There will always be time and pretext enough

139
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
For people to compromise their principles and perform poor public policy that may in the short run be popular

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But in the long run it will be detrimental to long-term interest of the American people

141
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We learn this through history in the 1832 bank panic Andrew Jackson had the question of whether he would remove the bank of the United States charter

142
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The people in the bank did not like that they threatened the prosperity the American people in the middle of a panic Andrew Jackson looked at these bankers

143
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And he said there are no necessary evils in government the treasury to you gentlemen is closed

144
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This was an act of courage on the park of President Jackson because he understood what was his stake was not merely in a femoral prosperity or a panic caused by the very people with their hand out

145
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Andrew Jackson understood this was about majority in rule

146
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It was about the faith in the people's representative institutions and those who inhabit the seats in which they are entrusted

147
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Today we are in a global financial bank panic. It is the first of our global economy

148
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We are seeing a leverage to bail out of the United States treasury

149
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And in the end these interests that want your money are threatening your prosperity

150
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And the choice you face is this

151
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You will lose

152
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Potentially your prosperity for short period of time

153
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
As the expense of your long-term liberty

154
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Once the federal government has got you to take that risk and pass it on to you as a quote-unquote moral hazard

155
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
They will be in the marketplace and as the free market is diminished your freedom itself is diminished

156
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And as your congress does not stand up to these and put forward a better plan that truly protects the taxpayers

157
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It truly has the long-term interest of the United States is heart

158
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You will be in jeopardy of losing both your prosperity and your liberty

159
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The choice is stark and it was put forward in the book by Dostaeevsky

160
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
In the brother's karma's off the grand inquisitor came to Jesus and he said if you wish to subject the people

161
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Give them miracle mystery and authority but above all give them bread

162
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And it has always been the temptation and a crisis especially to sacrifice liberty for short-term promises of prosperity

163
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And it was no mistake that during the 1917 Bolshevik revolution the slogan was peace land and bread

164
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Today you are being asked to choose between bread and freedom

165
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I suggest that the people on Main Street have said they prefer their freedom

166
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And I am with them I yield back right on

167
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Right the F on my friend

168
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So this was very interesting to me as I was following all these debates and I'm hearing Republican after a public and after a public and a post

169
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And a post this and which I don't maybe it shouldn't be surprising to me

170
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Of course congressman Dr. Ron Paul or Republican

171
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But I certainly have never ever felt that I was a Republican for any reason whatsoever

172
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And I think I've been pretty clear that I don't connect with Republicans or Democrats certainly not the candidates

173
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm pretty sure this is pretty much a professional wrestling where we've just got puppets who are making up a really big show

174
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And it is a show and it's a huge huge show

175
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But to hear all these Republicans oppose this

176
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Told me that the Democratic Congress really is the ones that has been trying to sell us down the river

177
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And it surprised me

178
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Because you immediately think hey this is Paulson the Bernanke this is a Bush thing

179
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's the Republicans it's the evil the evil right

180
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And you know it's just a pussy left

181
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I think who just let themselves be railroaded or who basically are the the puppets of Wall Street

182
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Anyway, lots more investigation to be done certainly on my part before I draw all kinds of conclusions here

183
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Some very interesting stuff on the drop and I'm not quite sure because I really am a little tired

184
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I am putting in full days here because I am here to work

185
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You know, I've got a whole bunch of people we're trying to create something here in my view

186
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But this was very interesting at least at first glance

187
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
There's something called the the Basel 2

188
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And of course there's a link in the show notes a daily source code dot com

189
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But it's an international banking standard or a set of

190
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
A set of rules or standards

191
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That went into effect I believe officially in April of this year

192
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And by October 1st which would be Wednesday

193
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Every single bank that wants to participate in this international banking network

194
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Or the ability to actually communicate and do trade and lend borrow transfer etc

195
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
We'll have to adhere to the Basel 2 standards left to comply

196
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And somehow this may have something to do with the reason why this was

197
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Blown in so fast and why everything had to had to take place

198
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Lickety split overnight

199
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
If you want please have a look at the information

200
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And see if you can help us deduct this and figure out exactly what's going on

201
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh, by the way, before I forget Shana Tova

202
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It is Jewish New Year officially

203
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
At least here in San Francisco and for those of you in Australia

204
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Hope you enjoyed it

205
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
In the United Kingdom meanwhile

206
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Wow, things not going too well there either

207
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The after northern rock, I guess the the largest mortgage lender

208
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Which was still a real company is now been nationalized

209
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
According to the telegraph it will cost taxpayers 150 billion pounds

210
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
To to nationalize Bradford and Bingley

211
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
One of the country's biggest mortgage lenders that's like almost 300 billion dollars

212
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You can't tell me this is all just because of the subprime crisis in the United States

213
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Clearly there's something going on

214
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We've been through it many times

215
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's really a house of cards a big Ponzi scheme

216
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The whole idea of how fractional or reserve banking works

217
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
How you can essentially print money out of thin air

218
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And it looks like it's back to the real economy

219
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Like we really got to get back to work and build stuff up

220
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And keep a very sharp look out for what people are attempting to do

221
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Some interesting feedback on the drop

222
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
There's a people now using it kind of as a comment thread

223
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Which I'm not a big fan of a much rather you did that in the comments section

224
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Of the show page itself

225
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Title of this don't let Adams distortions fool you

226
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And it basically debunks my entire

227
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Theory as to why we should not approve this bail out

228
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Need more economic savants to get in there

229
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But that's too bad that

230
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's easy for Adam to say he'll comfortably ride out the complete collapse

231
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
In his mansion with fistfuls of cash in a bar of gold

232
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You and I will suffer badly probably lose our houses and families

233
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And many will die Adam will feel little pain

234
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You and I will bear the brunt Adam doesn't seem to understand the stakes

235
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Now I think I do and I've got 70 people here in San Francisco

236
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
who depend on me to keep this and not just myself

237
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But all of the media management to keep this company running

238
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Luckily during all types of economic downturns

239
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Entertainment always seems to fare reasonably well

240
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So a little harsh there on what I do and do not understand

241
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And of course you can't look in my pocket book and I can't look in your wallet

242
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So you don't know what I have and what I don't have and vice versa

243
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And if I have a lot of dollars and a dollar goes down

244
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's going to be just as bad for me as it is for you

245
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
By the way the pound was down significantly against all kinds of

246
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Different currencies such as the dollar

247
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So anyway

248
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I love this this was pretty funny

249
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Buy my shitpile.com

250
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Now there's a go daddy domain that or a good inspiration to hook yourself up with a go daddy domain

251
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You got to take a look at this what happens on Main Street effects Wall Street

252
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And you can basically upload your shitpile that you'd like to be bailed out from

253
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And there's all kinds of funny stuff here

254
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Broken heart

255
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Million

256
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Dirty video games 55 bucks

257
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's a cool site. You should take a look at that

258
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And also if you want to set something up like that yourself

259
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Then go ahead and use my go daddy code which will find in the show

260
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Now it's a daily source code dot com

261
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So over the weekend as I said

262
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Saturday I just did some grocery shopping and kind of stocked up a little bit

263
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Because as you know I'm staying out here for a while

264
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So we get some stuff rolling which will be seeing

265
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
By the way, if not the end of this week the beginning of next week

266
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
We're setting some stuff up

267
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The return of texture more on that later in the week

268
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Or as I said beginning of next week

269
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And I'm reading through this

270
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Economic emergency economic stabilization act

271
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And I get a ping from no actually

272
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I knew that twit was coming on

273
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And I'd never really had the opportunity to check out the live stream

274
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And the chat room because it's always like one a.m. on Sunday

275
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Or actually so Monday morning in the UK

276
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So I think I love flip it on

277
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And before they started the show

278
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And John C. Devoreck was on he's

279
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
He's talking with Leo

280
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And actually they were talking about

281
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Sponsorship and financial stuff

282
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And so I sent John a little Skype and I said

283
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Dude this is like totally on the on the stream

284
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And I don't know how many people in the chat room

285
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But there's a lot

286
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You may not want everyone to hear this

287
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And then Leo said oh I don't even should join the show

288
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And I still had a third of this thing to go

289
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And he was expecting Patrick Norton to show up

290
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And anyway so I finished reading this document

291
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
They're still going out at Patrick hadn't shown up

292
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So I dial in

293
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And I was fun

294
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It was nice to be on to it again

295
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Because of course I don't get invited

296
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And then to get a spur of the moment

297
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Invite was cool

298
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And it was fun to talk about just some pure tech things

299
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Although at the end after the show ended

300
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
We did continue and here's a comment about that

301
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And by the way it was only so it wasn't in this week in tech

302
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Which was what episode 162 I think

303
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It was only for people who were in the chat room

304
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And on the live stream at twittlive.tv

305
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Who could hear that the conversation

306
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Which was well known behold about

307
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You know stuff that we chuckle had

308
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's usually talk about

309
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Hey Adam

310
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm not really a

311
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Took a little head

312
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But I do enjoy the head

313
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I don't know agenda

314
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I just got through watching

315
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Foot live there

316
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I went along and that the conversation

317
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I had there with Leo

318
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
After the show was over

319
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It was cold

320
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And as soon as I 11 got mentioned

321
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I knew it was coming

322
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I just stepped back and enjoyed the ride

323
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yeah I enjoyed that conversation

324
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I enjoyed that conversation as well

325
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And what's interesting

326
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I got several comments

327
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But all around the same thing

328
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
For some reason people have the idea

329
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That Leo and I don't like each other

330
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And

331
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
John C. DeVorac actually said

332
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Wow man you sounded like

333
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You were really pissed off at Leo

334
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I said what are you talking about

335
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I was like I'm happy to be on the show

336
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And then I started getting email from people

337
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Saying wow Leo was really mean to you

338
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm like huh?

339
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Please people

340
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And I don't know what it is

341
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Maybe it's just the way we interact

342
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
When we're talking

343
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I have no idea how you get this idea

344
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That we have a problem with each other

345
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
In fact

346
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Seeing all this type of commentary

347
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Leo, you and I got to do a show

348
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Man this will be fireworks

349
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Even if we're professing our love

350
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Each other people

351
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So incredibly confused

352
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm pretty sure that Leo and I

353
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Just like each other

354
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Okay

355
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah

356
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Hi Adam, it's Matt from Game To Weasel

357
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
On this week's show

358
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
We enter a curious village

359
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
With a guy called Professor Layton

360
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
On the DS

361
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I also play mercenaries

362
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Two on the PlayStation

363
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Three

364
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
There's copies of sonic

365
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Chronicles

366
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Up the Grams for the DS

367
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And also a feature about the new

368
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Spider-Man game

369
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Web of shadows

370
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
That's all the gamesweasel.com

371
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Alright Matt, thank you very much man

372
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I promised

373
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Myself that I do a better job

374
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Talking about the sponsors of the

375
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Daily Source Code

376
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And what kind of incredible deals

377
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
They have to offer the chuckle heads

378
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Let me just list them for you

379
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
If you're looking into

380
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Getting a rent a car

381
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
If you need a rental

382
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
For a week or actually

383
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You've got a deal for any amount

384
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You can get 10% off of any amount

385
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
That you spend at budget rent a car

386
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
By using my code

387
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You can just go to

388
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The show notes at

389
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
DailySourceCode.com

390
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Or curry.com

391
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And you'll see the codes

392
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Right there

393
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
30 dollars off weekly rentals

394
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
That budget

395
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
BrooksDone.com

396
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
If you don't know what BrooksDone is

397
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's kind of I would have to say

398
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Well, it was still around

399
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It was my second favorite

400
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
After sharper image

401
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
If you go to the mall

402
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You know

403
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
My girls I'll be like

404
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'll go clothing shopping

405
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Or whatever I say

406
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'll go find the sharper image

407
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And hang out there

408
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Of course

409
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Sharp image

410
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Went belly up

411
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And BrooksDone

412
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It's kind of like

413
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
A sharper image for outdoors

414
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You know, they've got like

415
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Barbecue thermometers

416
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And automatic

417
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Long lighting

418
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah, just kind of

419
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Different kinds of pocket knives

420
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
A little more

421
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Less techy

422
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But a little more useful type stuff

423
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
But a very very cool store

424
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And of course

425
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You can shop online at BrooksDone.com

426
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
10% off of anything you buy there

427
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
With my code

428
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Then of course GoDaddy

429
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Several codes there for the.co.uk domains

430
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
We give you half price

431
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You can't get a cheaper anywhere

432
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Certainly not a.co.uk domain

433
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And you'll get 30% discount

434
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Off of anything you buy using

435
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
My DSC3 code

436
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And finally

437
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You can still get 35 free songs

438
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
At EMUZIG.com

439
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
With no obligation

440
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Now that's not

441
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It's very different from other offers

442
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
That are out there that may say

443
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You can get more free songs

444
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But you can literally cancel

445
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
The minute you get your 35 free songs

446
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Again a code to be used there

447
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And all the links in the show

448
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
No, it's a daily source code.com

449
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And it's curry.com

450
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I've been following

451
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
What's going on in the south

452
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
In the southern states

453
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
With apparently there's a gas shortage

454
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And it's not really being reported

455
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
In mainstream media

456
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Which is confusing to me

457
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Because as I look into it

458
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It appears that

459
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
The supplies are filling in

460
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But yet again today

461
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
In Atlanta

462
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
The Atlanta Journal Constitution

463
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
This is

464
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah, the 29th

465
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
People are now calling 911

466
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
To get gas

467
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
They're running out on highways

468
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And I don't get it

469
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Because I thought that there was a supply

470
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But apparently it's still going to be three or four more weeks

471
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And people are getting pissed off

472
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Waiting in these lines to fill up their tanks

473
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And there's reports of some people

474
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Getting out

475
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
There's someone cut in line

476
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And you think that's bad in the UK

477
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
If you break the queue as they say

478
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
In Atlanta now

479
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
They just pull out a baseball bat

480
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Start whacking your car

481
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So I certainly hope that this isn't a problem

482
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That it's going to last too long

483
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Because you want to see some

484
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Shit come down

485
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And you want to take a look

486
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
When you can't fill up your car with gas

487
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That absolutely

488
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's a day record

489
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Let's put it that way

490
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
This is one you're going to see all over the internet

491
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Guy by the name of Stephen Spoonor

492
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And he is a security expert

493
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Now there's a whole bunch of YouTube videos

494
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And I'm just taking part nine

495
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I think this is a it's 12 different parts

496
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Maybe it's hours of the interview with this guy

497
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Who's talking about how the election

498
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I think this is even a dig

499
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And I saw a Boeing Boeing

500
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I mean if you haven't seen this yet

501
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
You might want to fast forward

502
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Because I do want to play it just a little bit of this guy's audio

503
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
From this YouTube clip

504
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Where he's saying that the whole idea of having electronic voting machines

505
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Is just prone to fraud

506
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
There is apps

507
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Just like thieves

508
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Can use a man

509
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The middle technique to steal your

510
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Your ATM

511
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
We are credit card information

512
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It all goes to a central processing

513
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Or it all goes through central processing

514
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
In the so-called cloud

515
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Well you know what

516
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Let me just bring this up

517
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You can listen to a little bit of this guy yourself

518
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Fantastic to hear

519
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
How

520
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
How's our how fragile

521
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Our our elections have become

522
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
With the

523
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The entry of electronic voting machines

524
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And he's actually calling the election

525
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
For McCain Palin

526
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Unless of course those who are the true owners of the earth

527
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Change their mind

528
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I have predictions for the upcoming election

529
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Should we do that?

530
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
McCain Palin

531
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
By 51.2%

532
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And a shotgun

533
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Probably winning by three of the tools

534
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And you believe that's going to be

535
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Because of course that

536
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Now this audio sounds really shit

537
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Now that I'm listening to it

538
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It sounded a little bit better

539
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
When I was listening to it

540
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Just on the laptop speaker

541
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Let me try a little bit further on

542
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Baby

543
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
We know

544
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Now we're getting out

545
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Oh crap

546
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
This is not good enough

547
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I don't want to put you guys through that

548
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Take a look at these YouTube videos

549
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
With this guy

550
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
He explains very clearly

551
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
How the only way to have a fair election

552
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Is by paper

553
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Ballets

554
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
No electronics

555
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And that the system is too easy to gain

556
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
He says the last two elections

557
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Have been game that way

558
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And quite honestly now that we found our voice

559
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And we have our power

560
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Maybe we can overturn some of that

561
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Maybe we can still do it in time

562
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's certainly worth consideration

563
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Because I think that we're going to have a

564
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
A close election

565
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And as you know

566
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm afraid of both sides

567
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I don't think that either one of the candidates

568
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Actually is going to run anything

569
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
There actors

570
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
There front men

571
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And it's people like

572
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Well

573
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Certainly on the Obama side

574
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Zignu Brazinski

575
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Who are running the show

576
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The guys who McCain's got on his

577
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
In his camp are just

578
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
As evil and frightening to me

579
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But there is something that

580
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
That is starting to bug me a little bit

581
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And I was actually talking to Janet

582
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The office about this

583
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Because she's noticed it

584
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And I would have to say it happened to me

585
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yesterday for the first time in person

586
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Where I noticed this fanaticism about

587
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Barack Obama

588
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
By people who are clearly

589
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Extremely desperate

590
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Very very upset with the state of affairs

591
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And see

592
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Not just the Democratic Party

593
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But I would have to say

594
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Literally Obama as the Saviour

595
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
As far as I'm concerned

596
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Vapit and empty claims of

597
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Change

598
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And

599
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The neighbor

600
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I've talked about here at the condo

601
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Like the horny millfee neighbor

602
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Maybe a cougar would be

603
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
A better description of her

604
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
So once again

605
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm going into the elevator

606
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Oh shit

607
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Hold on a second

608
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Let me just

609
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Sorry to do this to you

610
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
My cell phone alarm is going off

611
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Telling me to take out the trash

612
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Hold on

613
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Stop already

614
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
All right

615
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Of course that means it's six a.m. in the UK

616
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'm sorry

617
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Seven because that's when I have to get up and take out the trash

618
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm Tuesdays

619
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I've got no people for that

620
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Anyway

621
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So let me just say that

622
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I haven't seen her in a couple months

623
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And she lives on my floor

624
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Almost like across the hall

625
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And by the way, she's very pretty

626
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
She's I think she's my age

627
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Maybe one or two years older

628
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And once again, I'm going over to the elevator

629
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And the minute she hears my keys

630
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And she's like

631
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And this has happened so many times

632
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And she's like come out of her apartment

633
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And she'll have some kind of excuse to

634
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
With me

635
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And so I'm like hey, you know, good to see you

636
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And we're chatting on the way down

637
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
She had me like I'm going to put something in her car or whatever

638
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Like that was a big necessity

639
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And we're chatting

640
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And you know, she's smiling

641
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And we're just shooting the breeze

642
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And then she says, well, you know, I'm really busy these days

643
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Because I spend two hours a day

644
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Doing call outs for the Obama campaign

645
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm volunteering

646
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
But it was something

647
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It was something about the way she said it

648
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
That just kind of struck me

649
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And I know that she could see that in my...

650
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And I didn't say anything about

651
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
How could I, right?

652
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You can't launch it into the kind of

653
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Stuff that we've been talking about for the past months

654
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Or we're almost a year now

655
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And I know she saw it

656
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And she started to kind of get that fanatical look

657
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And I have a feeling that the love is over

658
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I really do

659
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And I'm seeing this fanaticism

660
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Which is somehow it's misplaced

661
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
In a way it's like a misplaced patriotism

662
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm not quite sure what it is

663
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And it's certainly not all Obama supporters

664
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But there is a certain fanaticism that is frightening me a little bit

665
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And I don't have to say that it feels

666
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You know, I really hate to say it

667
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But in a way it almost feels like the beginning of

668
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Some kind of fascism

669
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And by the way you have to really

670
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
If you're saying oh my God

671
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
What is you saying now

672
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I'm not calling anyone Hitler

673
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Anything like that

674
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But why do you think that it looks

675
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I know lots and lots of Germans

676
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And I know Germans who were around in World War Two

677
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And do you think that the Germans were born evil

678
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Kill people and take over the world

679
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
No

680
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
It came from something

681
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's bottom-up some kind of grassroots thing

682
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Where people are really afraid to

683
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Speak their mind or say what they really feel

684
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And they have a strong sense of nationalism

685
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And then it's so easy to get them hypnotized

686
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
By a few people

687
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And I don't know

688
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I can't quite put my finger on it

689
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
But maybe it was exacerbated

690
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
By a posting Dave Weiner made on scripting.com

691
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Which was so full of hatred

692
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
You know this whole idea of red states blue states

693
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And I hate you and you hate us

694
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That's un-American

695
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And that is so fundamentally wrong

696
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
To be talking that way

697
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
We all can respect each other's differences

698
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
By the way

699
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I don't see that much difference in what these candidates are saying

700
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
If you saw the debate

701
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
What were the differences

702
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
They agree on everything

703
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
That's confusing

704
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Very, very confusing

705
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
So I'll just have to hold to my

706
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Call it conspiracy theory

707
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
But I'll just have to hold to my theory

708
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
That actually what's going on here

709
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
These guys are just puppets

710
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And doesn't matter who wins

711
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
The people who truly rule the earth

712
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And by the way, their banks are still standing

713
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Goldman Sachs

714
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Morgan Chase

715
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Definitely members of the

716
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
True Owners of the Globe

717
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Going to the other side of the Globe

718
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
This is

719
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I told you it was going to happen

720
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Now there's

721
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Flu shots coming to the United Kingdom

722
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Already

723
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Being administered in Australia

724
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
This is the

725
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
H3N2 Flu virus

726
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Now remember that the dangerous bird flu virus

727
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I guess is H1N5

728
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
So it's all meant to look and sound alike

729
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But now hundreds of people have been killed in Australia

730
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
By the so called Brisbane H3N2

731
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Where did this come from all of a sudden

732
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And so

733
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
They're starting to

734
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Vaccinate people

735
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
For the flu

736
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And it's a very scary story

737
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Look, I just don't trust them

738
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I just have such a huge distrust

739
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
For these vaccinations

740
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And

741
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
If you live in Australia, Brisbane

742
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Let me know what's really being said about this

743
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Flu

744
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And let's keep our eye on this coming to the United Kingdom

745
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And I presume we're going to see this all over the world

746
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Once again, you know, this

747
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It still feels like

748
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Big pharmaceutical companies trying, you know

749
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
How many times have I not said this

750
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
If I was as evil as I think these guys are

751
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'd release them shit into the air

752
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So that I could just administer this vaccination

753
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I make money

754
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
These are big public corporations

755
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
They've got to do something

756
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And I truly believe that this next comment

757
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Which is about the

758
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Guardazil vaccine

759
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Which is

760
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Ment or

761
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Advertised as saving

762
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Young girls from

763
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
cervical cancer

764
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The way this person calls in doesn't sound like a true chuckle head to me

765
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
There's no identification of who she is

766
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
There's no sign-offs

767
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Um

768
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
But the message is very clear

769
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Let's dissect this one for a second

770
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Hey Adam

771
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
This is the first time I've been moved to get

772
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Really pissed off all listening to the daily source code

773
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm kind of behind those catching up and you were talking about

774
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Guardazil

775
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You're actually raging against Guardazil

776
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And

777
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I have to say I've been very skeptical about vaccines

778
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I can't say that I'm a big fan of them

779
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Um

780
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
In fact I was extremely

781
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Concerned about Guardazil when it came on the market

782
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And then when

783
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Some people were getting sick from it

784
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Yeah, I think it changed my mind

785
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Do some research

786
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I hate it when people say that

787
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Do some research

788
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I think I've been doing quite a bit of research about this

789
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And as you get into your story

790
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'll see if I can tell you what I've learned

791
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And

792
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I'd love to hear back from you on these points

793
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Yes, it's actually transmitted disease

794
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
But by offering up a vaccine

795
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Against it is not encouraging people to have sex

796
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Now see I don't think I have

797
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I've remade a big point about this

798
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So this is why I'm very highly suspicious of this comment

799
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Because I know that there's a lot of

800
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Schools and churches who are saying

801
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
This is promoting sex

802
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
That's why we should do it

803
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm against injecting anything into our children

804
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Okay, beyond

805
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
The vaccines which I I do believe

806
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Are real and are working and have stopped

807
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Death on a major scale

808
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Things like polio obviously

809
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
But once big pharmaceuticals got into this game

810
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And each child that is to be treated with this guardazil

811
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Cost about $500

812
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So it's a huge money maker

813
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Now I've never really really made a big point

814
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
About it promoting sex at all

815
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
But you do point out

816
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I say that it's a sexually transmitted disease

817
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So as you yourself will reveal what

818
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
What the HPV virus actually is

819
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
We'll talk about other ways

820
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
That you can combat this without going the vaccination route

821
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Whether we like it or not

822
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I think the statistic is something like 80% of women

823
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Will get HPV in their lifetime

824
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Now

825
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I have not seen this statistic

826
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
So I'm not too sure about that

827
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But seems awfully high to me

828
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Considering that this is basically

829
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Genital wards you know you get it from having sex

830
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And as far as I know

831
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
If you wear a prophylactic device

832
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
You

833
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Will be shielded

834
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
From this

835
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
And that could be as an adult

836
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Your husband could cheat on you

837
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Yeah, would you could cheat on your husband

838
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Good wind up with it

839
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And it is the biggest cause of cervical cancer

840
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And what makes the guardicill

841
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
In my mind even more important

842
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Is that it is like one of the first vaccines that

843
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It's not a cancer vaccine

844
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Although it is marketed as a cancer vaccine

845
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I've been paid very close attention to the news reports

846
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I've paid very close attention to the commercials on television

847
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It's being marketed as a cancer vaccine

848
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Let's go on and tell me what exactly HPV is

849
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But there is a direct direct link

850
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Between the virus that is HPV

851
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Which is genital wards

852
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
There you go, thank you, genital wards

853
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Do you know that

854
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
The way you used it

855
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
This is treatable by the way

856
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
It is treatable

857
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And you have to have a patch me regularly

858
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
And I believe that they can even

859
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Detect it with like vinegar

860
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It's this is not like something super duper

861
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Yes, and by the way

862
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I have two women in my immediate family

863
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Who have had cervical cancer

864
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And have had horrible operations because of it

865
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And both of them say

866
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
You know you're right

867
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
There were other ways to detect this

868
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
There were other other ways to combat this

869
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And the idea of a vaccination is weird

870
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Okay, and when it's weird

871
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I get suspicious and when I'm suspicious

872
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm thinking someone's out there to make money

873
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And when I'm seeing the statistics of girls dying from this

874
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Of severe pain, nausea, illness

875
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Because of this vaccination

876
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I'm thinking BS

877
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And cancer

878
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
So if it means that a generation of kids will have a far less chance

879
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Is having cervical cancer

880
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm all for it

881
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
In fact, they're expanding their label

882
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And the coming year to

883
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I believe include boys

884
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And also inoculate older women

885
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Yeah, I wonder how you know this

886
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
How do you know that

887
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm on the lookout

888
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
All the time for information

889
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I got guard to seal

890
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Just sounds evil to me

891
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I myself am almost 30

892
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I was disappointed to find out that

893
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I was not covered by insurance to get it

894
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Partially it's assumed that I've been exposed to it so much

895
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
By the time I'm in my mid 20s

896
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
But it doesn't matter

897
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Which is awful

898
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It's also partially assumed that I won't have as many sex partners

899
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And it's also because as an adolescent if you're exposed

900
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Or a late teenager or in your early 20s

901
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
If you're exposed to HPV

902
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You are a chance of having a very viral strain that contributes to that cancer

903
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Is much greater

904
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
So

905
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Looking into it a little bit more

906
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I kind of hate it when people do that

907
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
You would look into it a little bit more

908
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Do you re-threat

909
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Savans I call upon you I need a medical

910
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Savans to explain to me HPV

911
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Is it indeed just pure general awards

912
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Is this something that we need to be vaccinated against

913
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Are there other ways to protect yourself?

914
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I need some real information from a real doctor

915
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And not from what I really feel is like a shield for the pharmaceutical companies calling in

916
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Almost like she's reading a script

917
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And yeah, there are risks

918
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And the way that vaccines hit the market

919
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Big pharma

920
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Not always great stuff

921
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Keep that skeptical I are

922
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
But consider it consider a little bit more

923
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Especially where it comes to cardio

924
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
That's all

925
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
And notice she's using the brand name

926
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And not the medical name

927
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I'm hot

928
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I'm sweaty I'm tired

929
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It's been and that hasn't even been here a week

930
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It's it's it's a rough man

931
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Ah luckily I can play a jingle here

932
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Because there is a

933
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Comic strip

934
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Comic strip

935
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Comic strip

936
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Comic strip

937
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Time to move over to the European Union

938
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Here's our correspondent

939
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Comic comic strip

940
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Hello Adam

941
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So you say it's in financial meltdown

942
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I would say the world is in financial meltdown

943
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
At least the banks are yes

944
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And what is your opinion saying

945
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Well, you know we're saying let's bail out for this bank right?

946
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It's full of you say

947
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
It's because you say it was not regulating

948
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Markets enough

949
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Well, federal you says that's no federal measures

950
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And this is how you knew

951
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
You know let me just tell you that now

952
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
This is actually a comment that CSB sent in before the fortress bail out

953
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Which is kind of interesting to play it now

954
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
This is rampant

955
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
All right, this is not just the USA

956
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Not just because of

957
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
That that there was fraud going on in the states

958
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
It's happening everywhere it happens

959
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
On the European forces it happens

960
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
The London exchange

961
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I mean this is this was one big scan

962
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Have you ever met a banker that you actually thought was a smart guy?

963
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
No, these are guys that go to strip clubs all the time

964
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And hang out and drink and do drugs

965
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Because they know the game it's simple

966
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It's a really really simple game

967
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
EU is next

968
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Planning to go wrong there look what the European central bank has been injecting into

969
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Into the financial system

970
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Oh, no, this is not just America

971
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
This evilness is all over the world

972
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So I must say that I don't believe in anything

973
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I don't believe in it and

974
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Seren Paul said globalization works

975
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Only if free competition is at work

976
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And EU is too over-regulated

977
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Too fortified

978
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And EU fails to meet challenge

979
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Of Asian economies like China

980
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And others

981
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
So now let's enjoy the right

982
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
On the Titanic to downfall

983
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Western civilization

984
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So long and thanks for all the fish

985
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Yeah, thanks for all the fish

986
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I don't think it's going to be that bad

987
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
It's not going to be pretty that's for sure

988
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I don't think it's going to be all that bad

989
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I'm just looking at the markets and saying

990
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Hmm, that wasn't you know these guys are eating each other up

991
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
They're eating their young

992
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
They're eating a banks they're being hijacked to bring in the deposits

993
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
It's a big roll-up strategy

994
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I'm sure people made billions and billions today

995
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
With the way the stock market went down

996
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
You watch you watch

997
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
If we don't go into severe

998
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Economic depression with people dying

999
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Then it certainly wasn't as dire as it was sold to us

1000
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Is it good? No

1001
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Do we have to change things? Yes

1002
00:46:51,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I mean, while Gitmo Nation East continues to expand the United Kingdom this is this is just fantastic from the BBC

1003
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Children's web watch dog has been launched a new internet watch dog has been launched to help protect children from harmful web content

1004
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Such as cyber bullying and violent video games

1005
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So it looks like there's going to be some kind of task force that will take down these illegal sites

1006
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I haven't seen the legislation yet

1007
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I'm not quite sure exactly what this is going to be

1008
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
But the strategy apparently A established a public awareness safety campaign

1009
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Notice safety

1010
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Establish measures to protect children and young people such as here comes taking down illegal internet sites

1011
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It's going to be interesting to see what is deemed illegal versus what is basically free speech

1012
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Which I guess does not exist in the United Kingdom

1013
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Promote responsible advertising to children online

1014
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And establish voluntary codes of practice with an examination of how websites handle videos

1015
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Or messages posted by users a lot of this of course it's about social networks

1016
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
They're all going to take it down. This is just the beginning

1017
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
This is the censorship of the internet

1018
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
People who are so incredibly pissed off about the net neutrality

1019
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Here's your next focus, okay

1020
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Are these people crazy?

1021
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Are they absolutely nuts?

1022
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
How about educating your kids?

1023
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:30,000
You can't just do all this. There's nothing in the strategy here to educate children about how to behave

1024
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And what is socially accepted and what is not accepted and parents have a role in this

1025
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Taking down illegal sites

1026
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
That's next a daily source code

1027
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:50,000
No, no this guy's in sight. Oh, he may be using foul language. We should take down that illegal site. You watch. You watch. It's coming.

1028
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Proof is in the pudding

1029
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,000
This is you got to read through this article about the European Union Parliament

1030
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Where there was you remember the three strikes you're outlaw that that France started up

1031
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Well, I guess this was last week the European Union Parliament voted to pass the telecom package

1032
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Which is a big overhaul of the European telecom rules which included

1033
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Basically you know a version of this three strikes you're out

1034
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
And there was an amendment put in amendment I think 138

1035
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Which made it so that you know that it will have to go through a judge and a

1036
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Yeah, only a judge can really order a disconnection of your internet

1037
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Introduced by a French guy minister of European Parliament Gibono

1038
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I guess his name

1039
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And looks like Vivian Reading who actually we had on the show like she tried to keep that amendment out

1040
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
That come to think of it. She looks kind of reptilian

1041
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yeah, you think that's interesting. Check out this comment we got from Chris laden who works in our UK

1042
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I think he was doing an I think part of his intro there got cut off

1043
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,000
But it's Chris laden. I recognize the voice anywhere

1044
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
If I thought she'd just come across

1045
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,200
Schools in the UK and now starting to thumb print children and in the month the school has the

1046
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:37,000
The thumb prints in order for a catering system. So there's this third party company which goes into schools

1047
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Scans the children's thumb prints

1048
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And then keeps the biometric date on a database so that schools can have cashless ways of

1049
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Vending foods so the work so that the system is company comes into school

1050
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Can companies can children some prints children then go to cafeteria on pay for their food with their thumb prints?

1051
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So this is a couple things in one first of all this is already being implemented in big box supermarkets

1052
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Where you're given the option to pay with your finger print your biometric data so it's all kept on record

1053
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
And like dumb sheep most people think oh this is really cool

1054
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Also it's really the move over to electronic money was just gives more credence to or more

1055
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Possibilities for people to to make up fake money

1056
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And I'm just a believer in in real

1057
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
You could call it gold backed

1058
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
But some kind of real valuable

1059
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Value not just pieces of paper and so removing even that piece and taking it on to the digital realm

1060
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
It's just not a very good idea

1061
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Along with that comes the story of this

1062
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Information which by the way the UK is very good at losing misplacing dropping into the wrong hands. It happens all the time

1063
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:02,000
And it's just another piece of the get-mo nation big brother cafeteria on pay for their food with their thumb prints

1064
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I mean this credit time is quite attached. Oh, so you can see if the kids eating you know

1065
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
What the kids eating if they're eating right more reasons to take your children away from you?

1066
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
That's happening more and more throughout the world

1067
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Parents being blamed for a number of things and this is proof

1068
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
kind of things now

1069
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
This is where I get really started to freak down because schools have schools

1070
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And now the government had access to children's

1071
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Some friends at the point this has been going on for years

1072
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Once that school is in reddish, it's called Trinity High

1073
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
That's Trinity High to all took UK if you want to go and bomb art their website

1074
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,000
There's also another one in Bishop's store for that thing that's Bishop's store food high school something like that

1075
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
These are two that are come across

1076
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,000
But yeah, there are companies that go around into schools take children's thumb prints and then keep them on a government database

1077
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
It's with ridiculous

1078
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And

1079
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,000
It's strange because some schools are based in nine children food. It's the case if we don't have your thumb print we're not gonna sell you food

1080
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Yeah, there you go. There you go. No thumb print no eaten

1081
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
A school that did this is morally high school and leads

1082
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
It is forced one of its parents to make their child pack lunches

1083
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
This is school provided an alternative way for children to receive their dinner

1084
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
There's either a case of we have your thumb prints and we serve you food

1085
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Or you're gonna starve

1086
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Which is absolutely ridiculous

1087
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,000
This is a complete outrage. This again is a complete case of them not working for us

1088
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
No then

1089
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Spying on us and watching our every move

1090
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It's the whole big brother situation all over again

1091
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It's biometric dates and the government has access to this just isn't generally good thing

1092
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Hey Chris really knows what he's talking about because he keeps getting searched randomly when it comes

1093
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Out of the tube station the the subway

1094
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Just you know minding his own business random search

1095
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:58,040
And if you say you don't want to be searched, they rest you and the United Kingdom and you're taking downtown and

1096
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,760
Then they really search you and they waste your time essentially it happens to him lots of times

1097
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,760
He's a frequent travel on the tube

1098
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,400
Get my own nation my friends get my own nation east

1099
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,800
Either I hope you well right here

1100
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,200
Hope you end love you. I mean at no home. Oh, they work for us

1101
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,360
Yeah, we got to keep reminding him Chris we really really do a man

1102
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,080
We really do

1103
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,080
Where's the outrage in the United Kingdom?

1104
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:30,280
It was so nice to see Americans pissed off and saying hey we're not standing for that crap

1105
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,480
We need that same type of outrage in the United Kingdom. Here's something that might spawn it

1106
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,440
This is from the times main stream media publication

1107
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:51,720
Drivers will be banned after two convictions if they exceed the speed limit by 15 miles per hour in urban areas or 25 miles per hour on motorways

1108
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,200
This is new road safety laws

1109
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:59,480
So the way they do this of course is with digital cameras

1110
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:07,560
The track average speeds over long distances rather than what they call the gatso cameras. I've never heard that term gatso

1111
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:14,120
Basically those are the the speed cameras that record speed at a single point flash, you know, they get you

1112
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,720
So this is now they're tracking you over long distances

1113
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,800
And they look at your average speed and based upon so they don't even have you violating you know

1114
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,280
I could have be teleporting for all I care

1115
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:32,680
But they said look you you you start you were here at 10 a.m. and you were there at 10 30

1116
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,880
I'm sorry you drove too fast and if you do it again, we're taking away your license

1117
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,640
Ah

1118
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,640
Meanwhile the true criminal criminals are

1119
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,680
hard at work scheming to take away

1120
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,280
more of our freedoms

1121
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,760
Yeah

1122
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,760
But you know what we're gonna stick it out chuckle heads

1123
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,960
Because we do make a difference today was proof

1124
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,440
And you know if you tolerate this

1125
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,720
Your children will be next

1126
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:26,360
So if I can't you promise then I can't you fash least

1127
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,680
But let's follow a way too too

1128
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,000
If you got it all I can

1129
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:47,000
On a month's quick front and two people tells me it's what got this one man

1130
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,960
Yeah

1131
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,560
If you turn over 거부

1132
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:59,800
And that you'll be

1133
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,480
And if you turn over 거부

1134
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,760
Then that you'll be

1135
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,440
Who be next

1136
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Everybody keeps my heart down, always with my vision

1137
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:38,000
A beautiful land being so big

1138
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Holding your heart to date

1139
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,000
But I'm a pacifist

1140
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I've worked so hard for us, but now we're really in time

1141
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And if it's our reality, then we'll try and we'll be lost

1142
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And if it's our reality, then we'll try and we'll be lost

1143
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:24,000
We'll be lost, we'll be lost

1144
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:31,000
We'll be lost

1145
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And if it's our reality, then we'll try and we'll be lost

1146
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And if it's our reality, then we'll be lost

1147
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:11,000
And if it's our reality, then we'll try and we'll be lost

1148
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:19,000
And if it's our reality, then we'll try and we'll be lost

1149
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:26,000
We'll be lost

1150
00:59:49,000 --> 01:00:19,000
And if it's our reality, then we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try and we'll try

1151
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:49,000
and they'll work for us. It's a good thing. Doesn't mean that I don't want to like just play some jam and songs on a show this week. Even I get a little tired of it all. Alright, I got a good all I got to go to bed. You know, I was just thinking. I'm gonna turn this into a positive. I'm gonna invite my neighbor Laku guy. We're gonna call her Laku guy. I'm gonna invite her to dinner. Maybe launch her dinner and I'll see if I can get inside her head and see what's going on. And of course, I will report back here chuckle heads on the next day.

1152
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,680
source code or one in the bare near future here for the next couple of weeks in San Francisco.

1153
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:57,720
Until tomorrow, the day after or maybe even to the footballer Friday,

1154
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:05,800
enjoy your freedom because you're learning how to take advantage of the system to enjoy more of it.

1155
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:12,760
But whatever you do, whatever you do, live your life with passion. Another fine,

1156
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,960
and be the old presentation, stick it in your ear.
