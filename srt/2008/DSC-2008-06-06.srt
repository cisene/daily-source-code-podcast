I mean, is this thing on the radio?

360
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,040
I think I've heard this before.

361
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,400
I've sourced it on the podcast,

362
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,960
I'm using network, electric, soul,

363
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,240
but I know I'll place a link in the show notes

364
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
and if I get to it.

365
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,640
I am so personally full of artists

366
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,120
as the outrageous, what a week it's been.

367
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,960
And then I find out today that the Builderberg Group

368
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,320
is meeting in Virginia, the Builderberg Group.

369
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,840
Of course, started by Prince Bernard of the Netherlands,

370
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,800
which is rumored to be the secret meeting,

371
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,320
annual meeting of all the world leaders,

372
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,440
mainly people from royalty and the financial world,

373
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,800
also a big media moguls are there,

374
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,160
but you never read anything about it in the press anywhere.

375
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,360
And so I kind of got sucked in a little bit.

376
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,720
Before I know it, there I am.

377
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,440
I'm on Alex Jones's site and I'm reading up on it.

378
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,800
And I'm spiraling down into Build Giltner's videos

379
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,080
about 9, 11, that they were no actual planes.

380
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,440
Oh, man, it's like, oh, my brain just hurts.

381
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,880

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,240
when he actually views Giltner,

388
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,360
there's a base to launch his attack on Danish health London.

389
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,680
He's only managing to reach the outskirts of the city

390
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,320
and messes him six hours.

391
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,280
The feet occasionally match to the stage, right?

392
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Yeah.

393
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,880
Happy once again to say hello to the one-on-one he surges he took.

402
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
Yeah.

403
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,680
To make a motion to rock this mother out.

404
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,360
Your honor, please don't bang that gavel.

405
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,960
You can try this cowbell out.

406
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,840
Let's all give a night.

407
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:49,640
To the hardest work and lawyer, he's charging time, yeah.

408
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,040
He's charging time, oh, yeah.

409
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,880

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,960
So dude, I've got to give you somebody big this week.

413
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:14,280
One of my all-time, all-time favorite potsafe artist is back with her brand new album.

414
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

415
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm feeling a little horny this week because I got blue number nine.

416
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,960
Stephanie Saskin and the gang is right out of Jersey City, New Jersey, and they are just

417
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,400
absolutely a lot of fun.

418
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Check it out.

419
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,200
It's a brand spanking new one from blue number nine called I like the way you move on the

420
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,600
daily F and source code.

421
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,120
Check it out.

422
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:57,520
I used to spend my time just keeping busy not to hear the nagging voices side by head

423
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,640
with my friend love it's no brand new.

424
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,960
I know one will understand your whole jaw hand with fake controls so just give it up.

425
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,840
There is no hope get used to being alone but then you walked into my world with a

426
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:20,320
sweet smile upon your face and I got dizzy when you told me not to worry about the past.

427
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,120
And the nagging voice announced that there was no way this could last but I was swept

428
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:33,640
away by love and hoping to take a chance because I like it I like it, I like it

429
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:43,480
with you, I like it, I like it, I like the way you move, I like it, I like it, I like it

430
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,840
with you, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like the way you move.

431
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:58,160
What the honey move it ended like honey moons always cool little irks and things you did out of the blues

432
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:09,200
and the wangers turned my cheek to see just good all the way I felt miss on the stud and when you asked me what was wrong I couldn't tell you what I should

433
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:19,280
said I like it, I like it, I like it with you, I like it, I like it, I like the way you move.

434
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Said, I like it, I like it, I like it where you, I'm doing it, I like it, I like it, I like the way you were born.

435
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Falling down, I came falling down, getting through the kitchen, fading, crashing around.

436
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,280
But we held on fast and it turned back around.

437
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:58,280
And now and forever I will sing it about it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it where you, I like it, I like the way you were born.

438
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:08,280
I like it, I like it, I like it where you, I like it, I like it, I like the way you were born.

439
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:18,280
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like the way you were born.

440
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:25,280
I like it, I like it, I like the way I'm kind, I like it,, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like that, I like...

441
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:32,280
You like it, I like the way that that makes it and it does, it's the jersey grows into work, of course.

442
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,280
Number nine source from Surgeers, he taught the official musicologist of the Charlie.

443
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
I like the way you move baby.

444
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,280
If you've never checked out all that pod safe stuff, you really should.

445
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,280
It's a good shot going on there.

446
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
Oh boy.

447
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,280
You know, I do want to talk about a couple of things even though today is a football show.

448
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,280
I'm going to keep it relatively short.

449
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,280
And it's coming up a little bit later on because we got lots of music to play.

450
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Lots of music to share, soundtrack from our live type stuff.

451
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
Come up in a little bit.

452
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,280
But of course, this being a Friday, you know what that usually means.

453
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,280
It's the hit test.

454
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280

455
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Oh, I'm casting with Adam Curry.

456
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,280

Hey Adam.

460
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
How are you doing?

461
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
I'm doing great, man.

462
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
I'm ready for the hit test again.

463
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
Okay.

464
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,280
I'm going to start right away with intro number one.

465
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
Let me.

466
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Oh, shit.

467
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,280
I know this one, Young.

468
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Oh.

469
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,280
I think I might be too fried to play today.

470
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,280
I can't come up with the answer.

471
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
Number two.

472
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
It sounds like I'm every woman, maybe.

473
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
Maybe, maybe chuck a con.

474
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Oh, yeah.

475
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
I'm going to say one.

476
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
Number three.

477
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
Boom, boom.

478
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Check it like a boom.

479
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
That one I know.

480
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,280
Uh, I'm going to do everybody walk the dinosaur.

481
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
Was not was.

482
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Oh, gee.

483
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,280
Maybe we got one out of three this week.

484
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
And that's it.

485
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,280
And all of this week's answers are from.

486
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Of course.

487
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
Hit me.

488
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
And answer number one.

489
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
What's this?

490
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
It's by Lionel Richie.

491
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Oh, well, gee.

492
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,280
I don't mind losing a point on that.

493
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,280
You look sometimes.

494
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,280
I sit in the wonder.

495
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Without you six.

496
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,280
You say I.

497
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,280
Say I.

498
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,280
I remember it now.

499
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,280
It's not on the soundtrack to my life.

500
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Say I buy Lionel Richie's answer.

501
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
Number one.

502
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,280
And this is answer number two.

503
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,280
By Rick James.

504
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,280
Yeah, I could have known this one too, actually.

505
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
Great James Glowers.

506
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
Answer number two.

507
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Okay.

508
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
I got that one right.

509
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,280
And this is answer number three.

510
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Was not was.

511
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
I like this.

512
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
For a million years ago.

513
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,280
I'll need a single bit.

514
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Pick up a monkey.

515
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Everybody walk the dinosaur.

516
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,280
Everybody walk the dinosaur.

517
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,280
Open the door.

518
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
Get on the floor.

519
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Everybody walk the dinosaur.

520
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
Look at like a boom.

521
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Everybody walk the dinosaur.

522
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
Open the door.

523
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
Everybody walk the dinosaur.

524
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Answer number three.

525
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Was not was.

526
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
And what to dinosaur.

527
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
And that concludes.

528
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
It's number 125.

529
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
Don't even ask me on.

530
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
How did you do this week?

531
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Let me see somewhere between really bad and sucks bill.

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280

Note here from Thomas Nyberg, hello Adam.

700
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,280
You seem to enjoy having samples of fresh human insanity

701
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,600
and evil delivered directly to your doorstep,

702
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,840
so I thought I'd share this with you.

703
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,360
Rick Falkfinger, the leader of the Swedish pirate party.

704
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,560
The skust a wire tapping bill called,

705
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,280
better adapted military intelligence gathering

706
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,040
that soon may hit hard on the privacy

707
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,720
of anyone relying on any electronic communication

708
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
routed through Sweden.

709
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,280
Check this out.

710
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,480
At about 20 points in the national information

711
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,000
infrastructure network, all traffic is spliced off

712
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,040
and fed into the fierce pirates of Adirn Staten agency.

713
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,240
These points are placed as to catch all traffic

714
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,440
entering and leaving the Swedish borders.

715
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,240
But we'll catch much if not most domestic traffic as well.

716
00:22:50,240 --> 00:23:06,240
So, you know, you know, you sure could all go on.

717

741
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,240
You got to ask yourself, do they really work for us?

742
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,240
You got to ask yourself, do they really work for us?

743
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,240
You got to ask yourself, do they really work for us?

744
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,240
You got to ask yourself, do they really work for us?

745
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,240
You got to ask yourself, do they really work for us?

746
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,240
You got to ask yourself, do they really work for us?

747
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,240
You got to ask yourself, do they really work for us?

748
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,240
You got to ask yourself, do they really work for us?

749
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
That almost hurts.

750
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,240
Man, those guys are nuts.

751
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,240
The Danny Warhols, they put this like a tracks up on the Pods head music network.

752
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,240
That was Valerie Yum, holy moly.

753
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,240
Those guys are pretty out there, I'll say.

754
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
I learned something really interesting today.

755
00:25:52,240 --> 00:26:01,240
Remember I was talking the other day about the possibility of RFID chips being located in 510 and 20 Euro bills.

756
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Well, you know, you think why would that be?

757
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
And of course you can test this yourself.

758
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,240
If you have a Euro note, 510 or 20 in Denomination, just pop it into the microwave.

759
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,240
And you know, turn it on for 10 seconds within a second or two.

760
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,240
You'll hear a pop and there will be a hole right off the center of the bill.

761
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Now, I've been talking to some people.

762
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,240
I talked to a guy from the RFID platform in the Netherlands.

763
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
And he said, oh, no, I've heard that before.

764
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,240
That's just a little piece of wire they weave into the fabric there.

765
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Like, well, yeah, but why would you put a piece of wire in there?

766
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,240
Well, you know, but that's one of the ways you can tell if it's counterfeit or not.

767
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,240
I said no, because I looked it up, you know, the European website.

768
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,240
And there's five ways you can tell if a bill is real or not.

769
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,240
And it has to do with the hologram, you know, some raised bombs.

770
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,240
But no mention of a piece of wire, which by the way could act perfectly as an antenna.

771
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,240
And I've been reading up on RFID chips.

772
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
These things are actually pretty interesting.

773
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
They don't really transmit anything.

774
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:14,240
What they do is they respond to what is known as an activator or a combination RFID reader.

775
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,240
But basically, it sends out a magnetic signal.

776
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
It hits the chip.

777
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,240
That's enough to power the chip, the send back a little signal.

778
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,240
And, you know, there's different frequencies.

779
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,240
And, you know, it really depends on what your what application you're using.

780
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:37,240
And for you'll get anywhere from a couple of centimeters distance range to actually a red reports of three to 500 meters,

781
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
which seems like an awful long way.

782
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,240
But, you know, it could be an active RFID chip.

783
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,240
But anyway, so I learned today by complete coincidence that as of June 15th,

784
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,240
so that's was at nine days from today.

785
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,240
And I've read nothing about this.

786
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Go ahead and Google it.

787
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
Do a Google news search for this.

788
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,240
And then once you Google it like in the regular Google search,

789
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,240
it'll show up to get the European website laws.

790
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:14,240
But as of June 15th, no person may transport 10,000 euros or more than 10,000 euros in or out of the European Union.

791
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,240
And the reasons for this according to the law, which, actually, I think I wrote that down somewhere.

792
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
And let me see.

793
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,240
It was like 1899.

794
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,240
I'm sorry, I can't recall it.

795
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,240
I thought I had my browser history.

796
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:38,240
Anyway, you have to declare, which is very similar to the United States by the way,

797
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,240
except there it's less.

798
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,240
It's now $10,000, which is significantly less than 10,000 euros.

799
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,240
You have to report it, which I'm sure not many people do.

800
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:58,240
Interestingly enough, now, at most major airports, already, they're using money sniffing dogs.

801
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,240
Now, they say that this is to combat whitewashing or laundering.

802
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:12,240
Whitewashing, this would be a European version, but laundering of money in particular for funding of terrorism.

803
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
That's why they say they're doing it.

804
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,240
So, I'm just putting a couple things together here, like one and one, that all of a sudden,

805
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,240
or some reason, this RFID chip in your money pops onto my radar screen.

806
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:34,240
When at the very same time, they're starting to put sniffer dogs out there to sniff money.

807
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,240
And if you don't declare more than 10,000 euros, then they can confiscate it.

808
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:45,240
And they can find you, you know, I've seen some numbers of 16,000 euros.

809
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,240
They can find you for not declaring your money, your own money.

810
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,240
And I'm thinking, you know, what is more efficient than a sniffer dog?

811
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Hmm, could it be perhaps an RFID chip embedded into the money?

812
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,240
Yes, he gets another star for answering the question correctly.

813
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
And is the food bar Friday, my friends?

And this is Go Home Productions.

853
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:02,560
you. There's often you've expressed a complaint before about how the web repeats bad

854
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,680
information and how it's all a bit terrible and no one does near original research.

855
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,840
Well it occurs to me that maybe that doesn't actually matter. It's like the gutter

856
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,480
press and Britain exists, but it doesn't mean that everyone believes everything

857
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,800
that's in it and it doesn't mean that the good information isn't out there if you

858
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:30,000
wanted and the the upside of course to the easy replication if the net is when there

859
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,040
is good information that is also easily replicated. So maybe it's not so much

860
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:41,520
worth worrying about. Maybe just be happy that we gain the things that we gain and

861
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:47,440
rely on people to use their nons to decide what information is good because I

862
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,440
think most people will only accept bad information if they don't actually care and

863
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,480
they're not actually going to act on it anyway. Anyone who's actually going to do

864
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,280
anything will go and find out the truth like you and the European Parliament. You

865
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,880
find the bad information and then you're going to talk to the right people and you

866
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,360
discover that it's bad and the net result is positive. I like that. I hope that

867
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,640
contribute something to the conversation. I love you, mean it, no home, great hair, hope you win.

868
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,600
They work for us. Yeah, keep out the good work. Yeah, thank you. Man, I appreciate that.

869
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,440
Whatever you're on, you better be sharing that. But you know, this is exactly what's gone through

870
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:38,400
my head, you know. I'm starting to see some really big pictures again and maybe it's just for

871
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,880
you know, it's a very, very much red pill stuff. You know, I'm seeing an overview. I'm looking

872
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,080
into people's eyes. I'm listening to how they're speaking. I'm seeing things happen around us.

873
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,560
There's no coincidences, you know. And it's just like, you know, more and more people are

874
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,760
tuning into this, they work for us thing and do they really work for us or are they working for

875
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,520
themselves and stick in it to us? And I'm conflicted about it. I really, really am. You know,

876
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:16,320
on the one hand, it seems so totally easy for all of this to be true. All the conspiracy theories,

877
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,200
you know, that Brussels is trying to take over the power on their end and that, you know,

878
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:29,600
there's all kinds of secret seeds and secrets and clubs and moneymen and powerful people

879
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,080
who are pulling strings all over the place and got a little bit out of whack with that credit

880
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,240
crisis, but they're re-adjusting and I don't know. And on the other hand, I'm thinking, you know,

881
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,560
we're just a bunch of fucked up humans on this dumb earth, you know, trying to figure it out

882
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:49,200
and we're probably all evil in our own little way. So yeah, sometimes I struggle a little bit.

883
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,040
I got this awesome, awesome email. I'm very excited about it. I want to share with you guys

884
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:03,360
crap who sent this to me. Oh, shit. I didn't do very very good on my, uh, on my prep today.

885
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:10,320
Anyways, from Russian to date, RAU. Russian geologists have discovered a new mineral, which absorbs

886
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,560
radiation from liquid, liquid, nuclear waste. They're now striving to chemically clone it in the

887
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,720
hope it may help solve the problem of radioactive waste disposal. So this new mineral was tested

888
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:30,640
and named at the Cola Science Institute. And let's see a quote here. It's nature that is showing

889
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,480
us a way to solve the problem of preserving those radioactive isotopes. That's what the, uh, the

890
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,680
geologists have discovered. His name is Jaco Ventuch. This is big news. This is really too,

891
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:48,720
atomic rod, uh, the big savant, uh, for all things nuclear. He got to get on the case man. I got

892
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,920
to figure out what's going on. This is really, really awesome. I'm excited.

893
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,720
Um, let's see, uh, let's get back to the music for a second here. Um, and I don't usually play

894
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,520
songs with intros, but uh, with a hell. It's a special food bar. Bernie hit it. Please.

895
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,840
Hey, Adam, this is Bernie. World of Bernie.com, you remember we used to talk when you were with

896
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,240
Pod Show. Yep. Now I know it's been a while since I've been in touch, but I've been working really

897
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,440
hard to bring new artists onto the Pod Saves scene. I mean, this week, I got four terrific artists,

898
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,880
and it was hard for me to choose which one I was going to get in touch with you about. I got

899
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,800
to tell you that there's a couple people doing this now who are like independent promoters for

900
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,040
Pod Saves music artists. And, you know, and they're starting something. There's something going on

901
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,120
with this. It's very much, uh, it's very analogous to the, uh, the old music business. Only,

902
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,280
it's like people working directly with people, independence, you know, trying to make some

903
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,080
shit happen, uh, hopefully making some muddance of money together, and Bernie's one of them.

904
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,720
And, uh, that's why, you know, I'm happy to make an exception for the intro. So I went with one

905
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,400
that was close to home. My uncle, Brian Kane, has been on the professional music scene for a while.

906
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,520
And I know, especially when it comes to food bar, you love hard rock and tunes. I got special

907
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,560
permission from him to play this Pod Saves and to share it with you so that you could play it on

908
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,200
the Charlie. This is a tune off of his new album called Haunted and the tune is,

909
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,320
you can't stay here. All right, let's hit it.

910
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,120
Oh, go, where you going? Go back to you.

911
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:47,760
And it'll do the flow. What you're going to do, babe, with me up some more, I don't care what

912
00:37:47,760 --> 00:38:00,480
you say. Leave it enough to the sky. I know the sides are far away, but taking the road so it's all the same.

913
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,120
We got to be all by the end of the day.

914
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:37,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

915
00:38:37,120 --> 00:39:07,120
oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh,

916
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:13,120
I said you can't say it, I can't say it

917
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:57,080
You know it's got a little bit of easy top and down, but it's fine

918
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,080
Oh no, don't have to worry

919
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,080
Is it a rubbish out to hurt me?

920
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,080
So it's taking me with you to worry

921
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:19,080
Yeah, I'm on my way for the same

922
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,080
I can't say it

923
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,080
Oh, I am an honest person

924
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
Bernie, you know me so well

925
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,080
I prefer to try like this on a footballer front

926
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,080
I guess what? I'm actually staying home this weekend

927
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
Go figure, Billion

928
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,080
Say the lady Patricia and the princess will be off

929
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,080
On a little trick for a couple days

930
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,080
So I'll be home alone

931
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,080
Up until Wednesday

932
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,080
That's a secret message, all the girlfriends

933
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,080
I'll be all alone, which will mean plenty of Charlie to be done

934
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
That's for sure

935
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,080
I cannot wait

936
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,080
If it's a Friday

937
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,080
We should be doing some music from the soundtrack to my life

938
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,080
Well, this is what I've been thinking about

939
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,080
And this is what I want to play and dedicate to the lady Patricia

940
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,080
Bad company, feel like making love

941
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:34,080
If I had those golden drinks

942
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:39,080
Of my yesterday

943
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:45,080
I would have been in the heaven

944
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:50,080

I think about love

952
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:37,080
Darling, if I live without you

953
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:42,080
I live without love

954
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,080
And if I have

955
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,080
The sun and moon

956
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:54,080
And if I shine in my heart

957
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,080
I would give you

958
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,080

They won't get their Tammy flew.

1064
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:15,600
Oh my goodness, I think if we can wrap up the conversation

1065
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,720
we've been having over the past week or two about the price

1066
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,360
of diesel, actually when talking with nuclear, of course,

1067
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,760
just to talk to you, we just talked about that new mineral

1068
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,440
that absorbs all the radiation.

1069
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,200
Wouldn't that be beautiful if that's true?

1070
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,200
Oh man, being out of sometimes it's hard.

1071
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,840
The figure out what's true and what's not true,

1072
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,960
but I'm going to stay on top of that one.

1073
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,400
A great article in GQ about nuclear power.

1074
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,920
I think it's available online as well.

1075
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,400
You might want to check that out.

1076
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,160
And then this showed up on the daily source code drop,

1077
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,640
which, of course, you'll find at drop.io-slash-d daily source code.

1078
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,560
I don't know who it's by, but man, it sure does ring true.

1079
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,400
There's only so much oil in the ground.

1080
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,120
And it's kind of like a really bad 70s Charlie's Angel soundtrack

1081
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,280
to them, but I'm digging it.

1082
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,680
In a way, it's retro, and it fits right into the Fubar Friday.

1083
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,400
The festivities are definitely all.

1084
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,400
There's so much oil in the ground.

1085
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,840
It's what a little bit won't be in much round.

1086
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,840
Tell that to your kids right from the ground.

1087
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:27,200
That's all because it's only so much oil in the ground.

1088
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,120
We can't get loose without that juice.

1089
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,520
We can't get loose without that juice.

1090
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,560
We can't buy anything when things are showing out.

1091
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,520
We can't get loose without that juice.

1092
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,960
Because the fact we just didn't got some things you can't get loose.

1093
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,120
Because there's only so much oil in the ground.

1094
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,680
So let it don't be in, not around.

1095
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,280
All the nightzones is out, power must be found.

1096
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,960
Because there's only so much oil in the ground.

1097
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,040
Because there's only so much oil in the ground.

1098
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,040
There's a fact of the nightzones.

1099
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,280
So what is worth something a little girl?

1100
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,040
Unfortunately, no sense for it.

1101
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,720
If there's always so much oil in the ground,

1102
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,720
there's no use for our views.

1103
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,720
No, it's use for our views.

1104
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,720
Because there's still not what we use when I see that awesome sky.

1105
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,000
But it's an end of the world where it'll wash away the ground by.

1106
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,560
There's no use for our views.

1107
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,560
No, it's use for our own views.

1108
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,480
Because it's just assumed that what we use when I see that awesome sky.

1109
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,320
But it's an end of the world where it'll wash away the ground by.

1110
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,440
Because there's only so much oil in the ground.

1111
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,520
So let it don't be in, not around it.

1112
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:14,560
You can tell that to a shield and why you're probably been brought that out.

1113
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,240
There's only so much oil in the ground.

1114
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,280
Because there's only so much oil in the earth.

1115
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,240
There's a bank of life.

1116
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,560
What is worth something a little girl?

1117
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,400
Unfortunately, no sense for it.

1118
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,000
There's always so much oil in the earth.

1119
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
We can't lose.

1120
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Now that you can't lose.

1121
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,240
But that's your one.

1122
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,240
We can't buy everyone.

1123
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,240
Things showing that we're cool.

1124
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,800
And the fact we just ain't got a picture.

1125
00:50:51,280 --> 00:51:09,280
There's only so much oil in the earth.

1126
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,280
There's only so much oil in the earth.

1127
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,280
There's only so much oil in the earth.

1128
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,280
Could you imagine?

1129
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,240
If the mineral really is for real?

1130
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,680
Damn, when that be awesome.

1131
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,760
Only so much oil in the ground.

1132
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,640
And again, I'm sorry.

1133
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,600
I don't know how to perform that.

1134
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:33,360
Maybe next time someone who dropped that in the drop can just leave a little tag.

1135
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,720
And tell us who that was by.

1136
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,120
So I can put something into the show notes.

1137
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,520
So normally we do a final thought of the week.

1138
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,320
I'm not actually going to do it this Friday.

1139
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,720
I'm going to let one of these comments that we're sending

1140
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,320
do some of the talking.

1141
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,360
It kind of reflects how my week has been.

1142
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,080
Hey Adam, this is Leslie from the Daily Christian Show.

1143
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,080
Daily Christian Show.

1144
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,880
I'm just plugging my podcast while I'm at Daily Christian Show.

1145
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,920
That's because I can't.

1146
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,360
About the European Union Constitution, sorry, 3D.

1147
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,960
Obviously it's written by some folks who don't understand the origin of rights.

1148
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,200
In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson pointed out that we the people are endowed

1149
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,000
by our creator with certain unalienable rights, life liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and

1150
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
all that.

1151
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I know the Daily source code is a no religion zone, so I'll stay in terms of everyone can

1152
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
get behind.

1153
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,200
Humans have natural rights, we're born with them.

1154
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,600
They're a part of our being.

1155
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,080
Government doesn't give rights to people, they simply recognize rights that are already

1156
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,080
there.

1157
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,440
Now the problem is that not everyone thinks the same way Thomas Jefferson did.

1158
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,000
They can't see how rights are a natural thing, so they think they're an artificial

1159
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
thing.

1160
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
They think we made them up.

1161
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,440
The problem is that if we made them up, we can also take them away, or we can decide

1162
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,000
that someone else's rights like the rights of a government are more important than the

1163
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,840
rights of an individual like me.

1164
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,560
And that's what you see in the Lisman Treaty, we have a right to life unless it gets

1165
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,560
in the way of the government.

1166
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,600
We have a right to respite, unless it gets in the way of the government.

1167
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,640
That's definitely not the language you see in the U.S. Constitution.

1168
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,800
Our Constitution avoids exceptions because look what happens when you allow exceptions.

1169
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,280
The Constitution makes an exception for habeas corpus and now look how President Bush

1170
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,120
is abusing the hell out of it with Guantanamo Bay and Secret CIA presence.

1171
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,380
The Constitution says your stuff can't be seized without due process, or bought out by

1172
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:20,920
eminent domain, and if it re-adact passes for due process, and eminent domain abuse is

1173
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,880
running rampant as rich people use local governments to take over the land of four people.

1174
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,800
That's what happens when you make exceptions for government.

1175
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,960
They government always takes advantage of those exceptions, always.

1176
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,040
Now look at all those exceptions in the Lisman Treaty, why even bother to list rights?

1177
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,160
But you see the exceptions are there because the writers that the EU Constitution don't

1178
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,160
believe rights are natural.

1179
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,920
Well, some of them might, but those people didn't put together the final draft.

1180
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,720
The draft reads like EU government is more concerned with its rights than ours, which

1181
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,720
it is.

1182
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,120
Except the government's rights are artificial, not natural.

1183
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,720
Governments aren't made by nature.

1184
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,520
By nature, well, you see nature on the nature channel, right?

1185
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,520
Only the strong survives.

1186
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,520
It's a rival of the fittest.

1187
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,280
Well, we don't want that, so we make governments.

1188
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,240
Governments are manufactured, not artificial.

1189
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,840
So since their manufactured, they have no rights.

1190
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,320
My laptop has no rights, my wristwatch has no rights.

1191
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,000
My government has no rights either.

1192
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,560
Stalling out of governments rights in a Constitution means you don't understand the first

1193
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,960
thing about where rights come from.

1194
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,320
If you think rights are granted by a government that you've just taken the first step towards

1195
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:20,760
totalitarianism, because of the government grants it, the government could take it back.

1196
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,760
Back to Thomas Jefferson.

1197
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,400
Governments get their power from the just consent of the government.

1198
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,520
If the government abuses its power, it's our right to overthrow it.

1199
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,040
It's not a person, it's not an entity, it's a machine that's gone wrong and when that happens,

1200
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,040
you pull a plug.

1201
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,040
Anyway, that's my rant.

1202
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,320
Thank you for watching Show.com.

1203
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,960
Demographics 37, starting somewhere between Diddley and Squat, single White Nail, love the

1204
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:46,320
show, love the hair, love you, man it, your wife is hot, the folder, six times, they'd

1205
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,320
better work for us.

1206
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:17,680
I'm Laces where you used to be, it wasn't inside of you, but the way you looked at me,

1207
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:28,120
you're getting a close test, so many mistakes, it wasn't inside of you, like it always

1208
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:58,120
is, it's me, talking to businesses, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me

1209
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:27,080
it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, I feel like a

1210
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,080
It's the world.

1211
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:35,080
You've been in your summer, but you don't ever find me home.

1212
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,080
What don't get up in your town?

1213
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,080
I do what I need, and you won't keep doing it.

1214
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,080
You're doing it, you're doing it, you're doing it.

1215
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,080
You're doing it, you're doing it, you're doing it.

1216
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,080
You're doing it, you're doing it, you're doing it.

1217
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,080
You're doing it, you're doing it, you're doing it.

1218
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:52,080
We are wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.

1219
00:56:52,080 --> 00:57:02,080
Come here to love you, you're free.

1220
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:12,080
Come here to love you.

1221
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:16,080
Come here to love me.

1222
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:23,080
I know what I don't know, I never waited with the night

1223
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:29,080
I know how hard it is to always walk out in the light

1224
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,080
And it's an ensign job

1225
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,080
To load a bad book in vain

1226
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,080
It's an ensign job

1227
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:41,080
To hang on to the jail, I'll never hear

1228
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:44,080
Don't know if I would you give

1229
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,080
They know your mother's late name

1230
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,080
And what you have for breakfast

1231
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:53,080
What you have never met

1232
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,080
It's an ensign job

1233
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,080
To load a bad book in vain

1234
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,080
It's an ensign job

1235
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,080
To load a bad book in vain

1236
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,080
To load a bad book in vain

1237
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,080
It's an ensign job

1238
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,080
To load a bad book in vain

1239
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,080
It's an ensign job

1240
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,080
To load a bad book in vain

1241
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,080
It's an ensign job

1242
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,080
To load a bad book in vain

1243
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,080
It's an ensign job

1244
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,080
To load a bad book in vain

1245
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,080
It's an ensign job

1246
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:35,080
To load a bad book in vain

1247
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,080
It's an ensign job

1248
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:51,080
Let those words be the final thought of the week, my fellow charcoal heads.

1249
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,080
Donamently knows it.

1250
00:58:53,080 --> 00:59:00,080
As those Sean Pan has those Rosio Donald and the Baldwin brothers.

1251
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,080
They work for us, don't they?

1252
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,080
Or do they?

1253
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,080
Until we speak again.

1254
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,080
Live life with passion.

1255
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,080
Enjoy your freedom.

1256
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,080
Another fine, medial presentation.

1257
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,080
Stick it in your ear.
