1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,200
The 60 million dollars worth of their plan strapped by us, 3 meters to the next generation

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,000
we do content in my ears.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,400
We don't need no speaking friends, me and I like to think I'm flying into this church.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,400
Augusti!

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,400
This man!

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:28,400
Don't the Cherichardly 790, a milestone program in the common collective of the chuckleheads.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,240
I won't say anything.

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:41,200
It came that took it all away,

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,320
the main highlight of all day and night.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,200
I'll always listen before you stop to revenge.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:58,040
That seemed to be something, but the way I was and before me,

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,040
You're a bit of grotesque

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,040
So many mistakes

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,040
You're the man that's trying to jump

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,040
Like it always is in me

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,040
Talking about you, this is you

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,040
While you're on dreaming

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,040
That's a little I love to see you

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,040
While you're on dreaming the other way

20
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,040
They'll take your light to all you're on, I'll hear

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,040
Because I'm inside of you

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,040
Maybe you'll never hear

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,040
Your touch makes the heart

24
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Everything you want to do

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,040
When I'm inside of you

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,040
Like it always is in me

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,040
Just talking about you, this is you

28
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,040
You're a bit of your summer

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,040
But you don't care about me

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
I don't care about you

31
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,040
I do what I need you

32
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,040
I don't keep doing

33
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,040
Doing it, doing it, doing it, doing it

34
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,040
Doing it, doing it, doing it until we're gone

35
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,040
We're going, we're going, we're going

36
00:02:52,040 --> 00:03:03,040
I know what I'm doing, I never waited with the night

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,040
I know how it is to always walk out in the night

38
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,040
And it's an answer jump, turn out of that book again

39
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,040
It's an answer jump, hang on to my dear eye

40
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:28,040
You don't know what I'm doing, I know what I'm doing

41
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,040
I know what you're doing, I never waited with the night

42
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,040
And it's an answer jump, turn out of that book again

43
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,040
It's an answer jump, hang on to my dear eye

44
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,040
You don't know what I'm doing, I never waited with the night

45
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,040
And it's an answer jump, turn out of that book again

46
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,040
You don't know what I'm doing, I never waited with the night

47
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,040
And it's an answer jump, turn out of that book again

48
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,040
You don't know what I'm doing, I never waited with the night

49
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,040
And it's an answer jump

50
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,040
You don't know what I'm doing, I never waited with the night

51
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,040
And it's an answer jump, turn out of that book again

52
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,040
You don't know what I'm doing, I never waited with the night

53
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,040
And it's an answer jump, turn out of that book again

54
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,040
You don't know what I'm doing, I never waited with the night

55
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
And it's an answer jump, turn out of that book again

56
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,040
It's an answer jump, turn out of that book again

57
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,040
It's an answer jump, turn out of that book again

58
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,040
It's an answer jump, turn out of that book again

59
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,040
It's an answer jump, turn out of that book again

60
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,040
It's an answer jump, turn out of that book again

61
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,040
You don't know what I'm doing, another beauty full day today

62
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
We had a great weekend, a great Monday

63
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,040
And typically I don't do a show on Mondays

64
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,040
But I really felt compelled to talk with you guys

65
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,040
Because I had some interesting things happen over the weekend

66
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Not just interesting, really important milestones

67
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,040
The first one, really took place just before the weekend

68
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,040
I got a link, which I believe was on the source code drop.

69
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Drop.io slash daily source code

70
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,040
That pointed to a new story about documentary

71
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,040
An Italian documentary about 911

72
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,040
And this thing is called zero

73
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,040
An investigation into 911

74
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Of course a link and a bedded link in the show notes

75
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,040
A daily source code dot com and curry dot com

76
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,040
As far and wide as I can spread this

77
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,040
This is the first documentary that I really

78
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,040
When I looked at this and I've seen a lot of these individual bits

79
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,040
It was done in Italian, which is interesting

80
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Because they have a number of Italian experts

81
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,040
And they have an England in this version that I've posted for you

82
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,040
There's an England English British narrative voiceover

83
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,040
That does the voiceover for the Italian bits

84
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,040
But it's a lot of stuff that I've already seen

85
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,040
And it was without a doubt

86
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,040
In fact, I sent this to a couple of people who I've never sent

87
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Any 911 truth videos to at all

88
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Because it has a number of experts

89
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,040
Many of whom I've already seen in different material

90
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,040
Available online

91
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,040
That really debunks the official conspiracy theory

92
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Because that's what it is

93
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,040
The 911 Commission report is a conspiracy theory

94
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
It's the official one

95
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Of course does not drive at all with the alternative theories that are out there

96
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,040
And what I like the most about this documentary

97
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,040
Is that it includes my favorite pieces of evidence about

98
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:45,040
The so-called plain that allegedly flew into the Pentagon

99
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,040
And this is completely debunked

100
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,040
And wildly fantastically and accurately debunked

101
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,040
That conspiracy theory, the official version

102
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,040
By the pilots for 911 Truth.org

103
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,040
Which as I was telling John C. Devorek on Saturdays

104
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,040
We were recording no agenda episode 47

105
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,040
I may not know a lot about architectural issues

106
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
I may not know the exact temperatures

107
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,040
The steel melts at

108
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,040
I may not understand how pancake theories

109
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
And all kinds of other

110
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Non-demolition

111
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Non-demolition building collapses

112
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
How they work

113
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
But I do know a thing or two about flying

114
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,040
And the evidence is extremely clear

115
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,040
That the flight data recorder from the flight that supposedly hit the Pentagon shows

116
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,040
And proves this is data coming from the National Transportation Safety Board

117
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,040
Which by the way, I'm fairly convinced it's Dr. Devon

118
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
And that's how stupid they are

119
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,040
But it shows that the plane flew over

120
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,040
The Pentagon by about 480 feet

121
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,040
And this is because they messed up when doctoring the tape

122
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,040
They forgot to set the pressure setting for that day

123
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,040
Which of course is historical evidence which we know

124
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:13,040
And so it decides multiple very experienced airmen coming out

125
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,040
And saying, besides that the maneuver that was made

126
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Is impossible to make for the most experienced pilot

127
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,040
The speed that was registered at the low altitude

128
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,040
Is physically impossible

129
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,040
It is physically impossible, okay?

130
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Physics, there's a lot of physics

131
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,040
But at least the NIST is not trying to debunk these physics yet

132
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,040
With more dumb and bad and fraudulent signs

133
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,040
So this documentary really got me excited

134
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,040
Because this is now something I'm going to show to my wife

135
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,040
To my daughter, this is something I would not be ashamed

136
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,040
To show at a gathering at a party

137
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,040
And when I say ashamed with that I mean that

138
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,040
It is so non-refutable

139
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,040
And the experts that talk about what is going on

140
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,040
And what has happened and what really happened

141
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Is so strong and so convincing

142
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,040
That there would be no discussion

143
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Based on fuzzy shaky video footage

144
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,040
You know all of these documentaries

145
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,040
Although good in their own right

146
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,040
There's a high amount of drama

147
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
And it gets people very confused

148
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,040
When you see professionals lecturing

149
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,040
And showing empirical evidence

150
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
It really changes the game

151
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
So I'm loving this documentary

152
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
The new story by the way

153
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
And obviously I'm going to see if I couldn't find it

154
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Before I take the report of the show today

155
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,040
The new story that I picked up

156
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Was saying how even show business friends

157
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,040
Of French president and current European president

158
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Nicholas Sarcosi were making jokes

159
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,040
About how stupid we are

160
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,040
How lame ass we are as Americans

161
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,040
That we're letting our government do this to us

162
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,040
Same type of noises coming out of Italy as well

163
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
And I'm thinking man just leave it to the Italians

164
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,040
To show us how lame actually are

165
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Then I hadn't seen the documentary

166
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
I'd only read this link

167
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
And I was planning on taking a look at it

168
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
And then I did no agenda

169
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
Number 47 with John C. Dvorak

170
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,040
And at a certain point

171
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
The conversation turned to him

172
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Quaring me

173
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,040
For the first time I believe he actually asked me

174
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Outright if I was a so-called

175
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Truther

176
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
A 911 Truther

177
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,040
And I said yes I am absolutely a Truther

178
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,040
And he started his normal

179
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Scoff and guffying

180
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,040
And the typical ridicule

181
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,040
Which is okay because

182
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,040
We have a lot of respect for each other

183
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,040
And that's just his opinion

184
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,040
But then I started to lay some facts on him

185
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,040
Some facts which are particularly from

186
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,040
Pilots for 911 Truth.org

187
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Which

188
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Really turned him not around

189
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
But I could hear it got him thinking

190
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,040
And John is an arrogant old bastard

191
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,040
And very set in his ways

192
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,040
And very opinionated

193
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,040
And it was quite a personal

194
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
I don't want to say it was a victory

195
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,040
But it was so extremely satisfying

196
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,040
To finally have used some of the evidence

197
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,040
That millions of people at this point

198
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Worldwide are now becoming aware of

199
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,040
And for him to actually start thinking it over

200
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
And of course I sent him a link

201
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,040
He hasn't commented on the documentary

202
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,040
But after the show I sent him a link

203
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,040
But it was so spectacular

204
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,040
And it was really kind of towards the end of the show

205
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
That I got really excited about

206
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
And like man if I can turn this guy around

207
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
If I can wake him up

208
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,040
Because he sees all the evil ways

209
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Of the thugs that run the world

210
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
The true owners of the earth

211
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
And a lot of that is

212
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
We cover in financial news

213
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,040
But I really got to him

214
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,040
And I got me extremely excited

215
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,040
And really made me want to pass on this

216
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,040
Particularly this information

217
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,040
This evidence and this documentary is far

218
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
And why it is possible

219
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
And then something else happened

220
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
On Sunday

221
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,040
My true friends

222
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,040
A comic strip blogger

223
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,040
And the candy man who do an answer

224
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,040
Show to know a gender

225
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Which you may have heard of

226
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,040
I know I've talked about it

227
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,040
Before on the daily source code

228
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
It's called Yo Agenda

229
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,040
And typically this show is

230
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,040
They just kind of refute everything

231
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
And I listen to it religiously

232
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
And here's the reason why

233
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Because it really helps me understand

234
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,040
How to communicate better

235
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,040
Because so often I'll hear them pick up

236
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,040
On something that was said

237
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,040
And pick up a totally incorrect

238
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,040
And sometimes 180 degree opposite

239
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,040
Meaning of what was said on the show

240
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,040
That it's very important for me

241
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,040
To learn how to communicate better

242
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Essentially

243
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
And I wish I had an answer

244
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
Show for the daily source code

245
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
I mean wow it's so helpful

246
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,040
Now

247
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,040
I don't talk about it

248
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,040
About that program typically

249
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,040
Because it's

250
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,040
Now they say a lot of

251
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Mean, often hateful, personal things

252
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,040
I know they don't mean it

253
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,040
I know it's all taken in just

254
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,040
And

255
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
And obviously a lot of things

256
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,040
They say are just completely incorrect

257
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,040
And not at all what

258
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,040
What was discussed

259
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,040
Or what the intent of a discussion was

260
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,040
And you know

261
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,040
John and I have both been called

262
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Pretty nasty names by these guys

263
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
But they are my true friends

264
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
Because they are saying

265
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,040
What they truly believe is right

266
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,040
And what was interesting about this

267
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Most recent episode

268
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
Now the no agenda

269
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
Number 47 was about

270
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Almost two hours this week

271
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
It was a long one

272
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040
But it was jam packed

273
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,040
And that show was meant to be long

274
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,040
And no agenda

275
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
A yoga agenda

276
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Was longer than usual

277
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
As well

278
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
In fact it was about

279
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
They had minutes typically

280
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
They do around 30

281
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
And they even play a song

282
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,040
And those 30 minutes

283
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
And what blew me away

284
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
Is that they were talking about

285
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
All kinds of stuff

286
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,040
Particularly about me

287
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
And about me, and about me,

288
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
And how I'm distracted

289
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
And how I'm not

290
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
And I'm crazy

291
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
But they didn't for one second

292
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Talk at all

293
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
About this evidence that I laid down

294
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
And what I was hearing

295
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,040
Was listening to the show

296
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
Was my God

297
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
I got to them

298
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,040
And they are so

299
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,040
Conflicted internally

300
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,040
They can't actually bring themselves

301
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
To speak about

302
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
This empirical evidence

303
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,040
That 911

304
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
The attack on the towers

305
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
The Pentagon

306
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,040
That it was an inside job

307
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
It was controlled

308
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
By the American government

309
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
It was what someone called

310
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,040
A false flag operation

311
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,040
And it is far and wide

312
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
And it is extremely vast

313
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
What a crime

314
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
That has taken place here

315
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
A global crime

316
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
It wasn't just Americans in these towers

317
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
And they couldn't bring themselves

318
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
To discuss the topic

319
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Even though that was

320
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
Without a doubt

321
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
The climax

322
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,040
And the most important part of the program

323
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
I'm presuming they heard the whole thing

324
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
And it's funny

325
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
Because

326
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
They had sent me a promo

327
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
And I said

328
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
Getting to the week

329
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
Or maybe even last week

330
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
I said, hey

331
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,040
People drop a promo

332
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,040
That hasn't happened in a while

333
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
People aren't sending me promo

334
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
It hasn't, of course, promo

335
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Start showing up

336
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
And so they sent me a promo

337
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
For yo agenda

338
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Which I didn't listen to

339
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
Until the

340
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
This morning

341
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Because I got it late

342
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
And we don't play promos

343
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
I know agenda

344
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,040
And I think I got to put that in the next

345
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Daily source code

346
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
And then I hear the actual promo

347
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
And I want you to take a listen to this

348
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
Because

349
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
It's just

350
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
It's amazing

351
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,040
Listen to this

352
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
So you love

353
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
No agenda

354
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
Podcast

355
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Or maybe you hate it

356
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,040
People are afraid of their feelings

357
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,040
And feelings are disturbing and painful

358
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,040
But how can you deal with love

359
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,040
If you are afraid to feel

360
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,040
Pain is meant to wake us up

361
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
So don't be ashamed

362
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,040
Stand up for your rights

363
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,040
To feel your pain

364
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,040
And visit your agenda

365
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
And listen to it

366
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,040
Put us about an agenda

367
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
Yo

368
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
So normally I would not even

369
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
Play that promo

370
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
After the show they put out this week

371
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
Because it had nothing to do with

372
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,040
A comment or a bottle

373
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
To anything discussed on no agenda

374
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,040
I mean almost nothing

375
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,040
It was just all personal bashing stuff

376
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
Which is okay again

377
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
I don't mind

378
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
And normally they do

379
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
As I said they do have a good

380
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
You know

381
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
A good show that sticks to the topic

382
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
If you listen to that promo

383
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
I mean that is the actual

384
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Projection of what they're feeling

385
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,040
And I'm here to say to my real friends

386
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,040
So Candyman comic string blogger

387
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
But really all chuckle heads

388
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
It is okay

389
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
It is okay to now say

390
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
That you have

391
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Feelings about this monstrosity

392
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,040
That you feel that something is a miss

393
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
That you

394
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
You may not know it

395
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,040
You may not be able to put your finger on it

396
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,040
But firstly it's okay to just say it

397
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
It is okay

398
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,040
You're no longer going to be ridiculed for this

399
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
Because around the world

400
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
All the way up to

401
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
The highest levels of government

402
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
People are now talking about this

403
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,040
The mainstream media

404
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
We'll not discuss it

405
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
We'll not show any of these videos

406
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,040
But it's okay for you to start

407
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,040
Investigating and start talking about it with your friends

408
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
It's now seven years on

409
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
And the time has come to do this

410
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Please

411
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,040
If you can download this documentary

412
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
Burn it to a DVD

413
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Let people see this

414
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Send them the links from YouTube

415
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
And Google video

416
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Let them see that there is

417
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,040
An alternative conspiracy theory

418
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,040
To the official conspiracy theory

419
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,040
And if you want

420
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
You can just point them to me and say

421
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
Here's someone else who thinks there's something going on

422
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,040
You can point them to thousands of places online

423
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Thousands literally

424
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,040
So

425
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,040
This is really this is really fantastic

426
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
I'm just getting reports from around the globe

427
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
The people are waking up

428
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
More and more people are saying

429
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
Wait a minute this can't be right

430
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,040
There's now book in the top ten of the New York Times

431
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,040
Best Seller List by a very accomplished prosecutor

432
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
The United States

433
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
I believe the title is

434
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Prosecuting George Bush for murder

435
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,040
Not a single bit of exposure on television

436
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,040
Anywhere still top ten New York Times Best Seller List

437
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,040
All the polls that are being taken now

438
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,040
80 sometimes 90% people are saying

439
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Yes, I believe that there was something wrong

440
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,040
About the explanation of 911

441
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,040
And it's okay to come out and say it now

442
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Of course this happened seven years ago

443
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,040
And it's taken us seven years for this collective awakening

444
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Which is now taking place and it's really running quite fast

445
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,040
And I believe you are going to see more and more show up

446
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
In mainstream media

447
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
Certainly in newspapers

448
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,040
That's probably what you'll see a lot of this come first

449
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,040
But you're still going to have to be a part of the alternative media distribution

450
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Network which goes beyond the internet

451
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,040
And the best way is I love giving out DVDs

452
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,040
It's really cheap to make

453
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,040
You can buy a whole stack of CDs for empty DVDs

454
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
For a pretty low cost

455
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
And you can just hand them out to people

456
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
And it's okay all of these truth videos

457
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,040
911 truth or videos are okay with you handing it out

458
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
You might want to check the copyright notice

459
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,040
Just to make sure but as far as I can tell everyone is on board with that

460
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,040
No one's making money with this

461
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,040
People just doing it to get the information out

462
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
Get the word out and start waking people up

463
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,040
But seven years after the fact and they have

464
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Advait they

465
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Okay in this case let's just focus on George Bush and particularly Dick Cheney

466
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
They have already advanced their agenda so far

467
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,040
We've seen what's happened in South Assetia

468
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
With the Americans

469
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Basically train the Georgians

470
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Gave them weapons, gave them security consultants

471
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Which is another term for mercenaries

472
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
They attack South Assetia

473
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Georgia retaliated

474
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,040
That was not part of the plan now they're getting ready for a war in Iran

475
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Which looks like this going to be a ground war as well

476
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Now as tanks are being moved into Afghanistan

477
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Where there have no use the only use for them would be

478
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Indeed to drive up the road across the border into Iran

479
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:53,040
And it's all interconnected right into the financial crisis

480
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Which is taking place in front of our very eyes over the weekend

481
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Filed for bankruptcy chapter 11

482
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,040
We've had Merrill Lynch being sold to Bank of America

483
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,040
And now there are huge put options on city group

484
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,040
So that may be the next target to be taken down

485
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:17,040
It's all interconnected all of this is a part of the same system all of it being orchestrated by a reasonably small

486
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,040
Number of people

487
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,040
But it's all the same and you know who they are you know how they're connected and they are so connected

488
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,040
To each other even through family bloodlines they're connected

489
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,040
It's just amazing

490
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,040
So one of the ways to fix a financial crisis is to start a war

491
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
This has been done over and over again

492
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,040
The true owners of the earth love starting wars because they make money on both sides by lending money

493
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Which subsequently is make to use to make weaponry and sell weaponry

494
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,040
And another way of course is

495
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Through drug trade you'll see that to start to rise again

496
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,040
As it's just another form of currency that is used

497
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,040
And I don't want to get into deep everything because I'm already so excited

498
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,040
That we can lift the veil on lift the veil just a little bit on this horrible event

499
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,040
That took place seven years ago

500
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:15,040
And there's so much has happened in between so much that we have to combat so much that we have to

501
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,040
Open up our eyes to and it's not just my responsibility

502
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,040
It's all of our responsibilities to help wake people up

503
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,040
So go get the go get this documentary again

504
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,040
It's embedded in the link to links are all in the show notes at dailysourceco.com

505
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,040
As well as at curry.com

506
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
You can show this

507
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,040
It's it's low on drama

508
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,040
Well, there is some drama in there obviously for effect

509
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,040
But still it's really easy to understand it's empirical evidence

510
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,040
It's evidence that everyone just cannot avoid

511
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:00,040
And I really urge you really really urge you now that you're starting to wake up to get other people on board as well

512
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,040
It's absolutely essential that we do this

513
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Alright, so that was the message for this Monday September 5th 2008

514
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,040
And I'll leave you now with a message from the musical genius himself as Eddie Murphy once said

515
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,040
Stevie Wonder loves a need of love today

516
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,040
This has to

517
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Could change your joy and laughter

518
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,040
To tears and may

519
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,040
It's that love

520
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
And need

521
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Of love today

522
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,040
Don't delay

523
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,040
I'll send yours in right away

524
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,040
Hey

525
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,040
For now

526
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,040
We can many homes

527
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
Stop

528
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Bit me

529
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:34,040
Before it's gone too long

530
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Oh

531
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:55,040
The boss of evil land

532
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,040
To make you its possession

533
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,040
And it will if we met it

534
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,040
And it will if we met it

535
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,040
And it will if we met it

00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,040
And it will if we met it

537
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,040
And it will if we met it

538
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
And it will if we met it

539
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,040
And it will if we met it

And it will if we met it
