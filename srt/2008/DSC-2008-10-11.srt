00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No, it's not the same.

406
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
No, it's not the same.

407
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
No, it's not the same.

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No, it's not the same.

412
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
No, it's not the same.

413
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No, it's not the same.

414
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No, it's not the same.

415
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,720
The metropolitan police of London had millions of stacked up there as a safe haven.

416
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,080
And now the money's been locked up.

417
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,960
What does the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom do?

418
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Gordon Brown.

419
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,080
He invokes the terrorism law.

420
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,880
He says, hey, wait a minute, you know, we've got to freeze everything up here because

421
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,360
these guys nice and they're, it's just terrorists practices to lock up our money.

422
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,240
How are you nuts?

423
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
This is crazy.

424
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,640
This Europe is falling apart at right there, right in front of your very eyes.

425
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,240
No coordination whatsoever.

426
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,480
And I am now more convinced than ever that the entire push behind the Lisbon treaty.

427
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Go ahead and Google it.

428
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,720
Go on Google news and you'll see that they're still really pushing to get this thing wrapped

429
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,960
up as soon as possible with a second referendum.

430
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
God bless the Irish.

431
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,280
They were so smart.

432
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,840
They wanted this Lisbon treaty done because it would have gone into effect around

433
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
now.

434
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,000
Round October would have been ratified by all the countries just in time for the world financial

435
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
system.

436
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,720
This is what they have been planning for maybe decades as far as I'm concerned.

437
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,920
Bankrupt all of the banking system get everything to flush it all out.

438
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,560
All the G7 finance ministers were in Washington yesterday in this morning and they've been

439
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,600
meeting, but they've been meeting about, they've been meeting about one financial system,

440
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,360
maybe even one bank.

441
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,480
And they're going to, and you can mark my words on it right now, right this down.

442
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,080
They're going to come back with some kind of new financial system, what they need now

443
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:20,080
is time to rewrite all the rules and it's going to be something based on carbon credits.

444
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
Mark my words, my friends.

445
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,640
We'll get into that a little bit later on because I do want to get to the music because

446
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,840
we've got plenty to do today.

447
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,400
Just one more thing about the absurdity of what's going on with Iceland.

448
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:39,960
This comes from the BBC, Norwegian politician, I'm sorry, I said Iceland, but now I

449
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:46,880
want to talk about how crazy our elected officials are in Norway, there you go.

450
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,440
Norwegian politicians said she will not seek reelection after running up a large phone

451
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,320
bill, ringing fortune tellers at Parliament's expense.

452
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,560
Sarah Khan, Minister of Parliament for the ruling labor party, amidst calling paper, minute

453
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,920
fortune tellers, 793 times in one nine month period for a total of 133 hours.

454
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,920
This is what they've resorted to.

455
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,720
Their freaks, the people running our governments think about it, who are these people?

456
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:20,880
Their crazies, their lunatics, of course not all of them, but you can bet a good 75 to 80%

457
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,720
are just fucking wackos.

458
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,680
That's why they took those gigs in the first place and crazies attract crazies.

459
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
That's exactly what's going on.

460
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,440
Ah, fortune tellers, can you believe that ship?

461
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,040
Anyway, what has happened now?

462
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,120
You heard it there in the beginning from Adam Freeland, we want your soul.

463
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,080
Everything's being taken away from us systematically and everything you thought that was

464
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,120
all a part of your reality, there was a part of what you quote owned.

465
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,560
You may wake up one day and you say, how did I get here?

466
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,760
This is not my beautiful house, this is not my beautiful car.

467
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,760
No, it belongs to the government, you are screwed.

468
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:10,080
You may find yourself living in a shut-con chat, you may find yourself in another part of the world.

469
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,440
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile.

470
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:25,760
You may find yourself in a beautiful house with a beautiful wife, you may ask yourself, no, how did I get here?

471
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:42,080
You may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile.

472
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,080
And you may ask yourself, how did I get here?

473
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,560
And you may ask yourself, where is that love, daughter of a beer?

474
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,880
And you may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful house.

475
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:15,200
And you may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful wife.

476
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:23,680
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was.

477
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:31,680
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was.

478
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,720
What are the jobings and what are the moves?

479
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,720
There is water at the bottom of the ocean, under the water, kind of the water.

480
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,040
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile.

481
00:15:47,040 --> 00:16:02,640
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was.

482
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:16,760
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, so as it ever was, same as it ever was.

483
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:23,760
You might ask yourselves, what is that beautiful house?

484
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,760
You might ask yourself, who does that, how they go to?

485
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,760
You might ask yourself, I'm alright, I'm alone, and you may say to yourself,

486
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,760
I'm not God, what have I done?

487
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:42,760
And you may say to myself, whatever, come in, I understand where's my life?

488
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,560
What a growing heart, that doesn't bid it blindly

489
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,560
into the silent world of the fog replaced?

490
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
Where's yours with what?

491
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,760
And you may ask myself, I'm alright, I'm alone, and you may say to yourself,

492
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,760
whomever you convince them to be born with nothing my money can do.

493
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:33,760
The party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's

494
00:17:33,760 --> 00:18:03,760
coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party the party's coming, the party's coming, this party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming, the party's coming,

495
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:11,880
very, very lucky that I consciously lived, as far as I was concerned, freely through the 80s

496
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:20,000
and most of the 90s, and here we are in the zeros, in the knots, as we see and say in the UK,

497
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,400
a whole new ballgame. What exactly is it all going to mean? Well, it means that we are

498
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,680
making a massive reset. When the Dow Jones falls and it will fall down further, I

499
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:41,960
believe we will probably see 7,500 this coming week on the Dow. It could even go 6,000 or

500
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,640
even 5,000. We are really resetting. Are we going back to the life of the 1950s? Very, very

501
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:54,520
possible. And by the way, we are all screwed. It doesn't matter how much money you have.

502
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,240
It's all going to be reset. It's going to be bait. There will be new standards. I mean,

503
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,360
just look at the coordination of the lowering of the central banks for their interest rates.

504
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,280
They did it all simultaneously. So it's not to screw one currency over the other. Of course,

505
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:17,920
all currencies are severely suppressed right now, except for the dollar. It's being held up completely

506
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,760
on, well, I guess it's the faith and credit of the United States, whatever you want to call

507
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,120
up, but it's all manipulated. All of these markets are. And it's been going on for decades.

508
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,440
And now it's finally come home to Roost. And this is not just the mistake. It's not like

509
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,360
no one could see this. Even I can understand how this worked. This was planned. Totally totally

510
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,640
planned. And how do you know? I know it's planned. Well, because the signs have been there.

511
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,080
The warnings have been there. Smart people have been telling us this for years. And this

512
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,800
kind of what bumps me out, honestly, is that I certainly wasn't listening. And by the way,

513
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,560
we're not going to change anything overnight. It'll take a long time for us to change,

514
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,640
but just by realizing what's going on, just by understanding the situation will help us,

515
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,560
because wow, I sure wish I could take some of that anger that people are feeling about the

516
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:10,680
possibility of Obama not becoming president. And how angry everyone is, I wish I could take

517
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:16,360
some of that anger and focus it on the fact that both parties are the same. That they're all

518
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:22,280
out to screw us. They're owned by the corporations and by Wall Street. And who's been preaching

519
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,480
this? Who has been preaching this for decades? Let's step in the way back machine, my friends.

520
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:35,640
My chuckleheads. The community that is awake and listened to Dr. Ron Paul from 1983,

521
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:44,680
25 years ago. He knew it was going on, but we didn't listen. There is no other power greater than the

522
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,840
power over money. The power to create and contract the money supply. The power to control the

523
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:58,680
purchasing power of your money for out history. This has proven to be the most sought after monopolistic

524
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:05,320
power of man. It has been come more sophisticated over the decades and over the centuries,

525
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,840
more sophisticated now and more international and scope than ever before. So I see the issue of

526
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,360
power and the control over money as being something that we cannot ignore, we must address.

527
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:23,800
I believe closely associated with this is the issue of morality as well. By what moral right

528
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,000
we have to create purchasing power out of thin air. Whether it's done by the creation of credit

529
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,400
or federal reserve notes or whether it's the creation of SDRs in an international scope,

530
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,160
by what right do they do this? Is it any more moral to dilute the value of your purchasing

531
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,560
power or the money you hold in your wallet than it is for the farmer to dilute the milk supply

532
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:49,720
with water? I would say there's an issue of morality here just as strong as the issue of power.

533
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:57,320
I also happen to believe also because it's a moral issue more than an economic issue. It is for this

534
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,800
reason that people have lost trust in their government, trust in the banks, trust in business,

535
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:07,400
trust in themselves and that we are a nation of distrust. It is for this reason I believe that

536
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,440
until we restore trust in government, trust in the system and trust in the money,

537
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:19,080
there will be no resolution of this problem. It is the issue of trust in people and trust in money

538
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,680
that must come before you can start talking about nickeling and diamond that trying to get back

539
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,840
to a balance budget because that certainly hasn't worked. So I think it's important to address the

540
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:37,800
issue of central planning. The issue of power and third, I think that we must address in general

541
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,800
terms the issue of the origin of money. I know that's been talked about and we recognize those

542
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:50,200
of us who believe in commodity money. Clearly understand that money, paper money and credit creation

543
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,040
didn't come out of the marketplace. That came out of the heads and the fantasies of the

544
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:02,040
intellectuals and the government officials of those who want paper to be money but never

545
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,960
out of the marketplace. So I would say the paper standard is bucking history and it's bucking

546
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:14,440
economic law and economic truth and they only can do it with force and more power to make people

547
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:21,960
accepted because economically and historically paper is not money. It can't be money. It's only

548
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,720
money because we're forced to use it and because there's a residual trust in the pieces of paper

549
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:34,200
that we cared around because at one time it did help real value. You have to have something

550
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,800
that people seek after and they hold as something important is something that they will hold

551
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:46,440
as money. History shows that people have chosen gold first and probably silver second and rather

552
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,440
have cigarettes than pieces of paper.

553
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:31,400
I felt this way, a lot of times we live in our way, who we will not only just say, and nothing else

554
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:50,360
lost love. Trust us in their mind in you, every day more or something new. Open mind more and different

555
00:24:50,360 --> 00:25:00,360
you and nothing else matters.

556
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:10,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they know.

557
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:16,360
Never came for what I know.

558
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:26,360
So close to no matter how far, can we reach more and more,

559
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:36,360
to remember our trust in you and everything else matters.

560
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:52,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they know.

561
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

562
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:20,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

563
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:30,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

564
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:46,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:52,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:58,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

570
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:14,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

571
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:38,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

572
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:46,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

573
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:16,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

574
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:24,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

575
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:32,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

576
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do.

00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:26,360
came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. It turned out to be a good thing. Never get in touch them. Never came for what they do. Never came for forgotten what they do. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they did. Never came for what they do. Never came for what they do. Never come for what they do.

Never came for what they do. Never came for

581
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:32,800
all. And I wanted to see is it from CNBC?

582
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,640
Just check. Let me see this. Oh no. Yeah, it is actually. This is from the UK version.

583
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,720
I think of Squawk Box. And on the program, they have legendary investor, Jim Rogers.

584
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,560
And so, you know, we heard Ron Paul talk 25 years ago. Now, listen to what Jim Rogers,

585
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,200
who is a very wealthy man, he definitely knows how to play the markets, listen to what

586
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,800
he's saying about what's going on right now. Jim, of course, a legendary investor.

587
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:05,440
Jim, can I start off by asking you why you think the equity markets are not responding

588
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,440
to the stabilization plans that are being introduced around the world at the moment?

589
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:17,180
Because they're absurd. Jeff, we have people. If I had come on your show every week for

590
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:21,680
100 weeks in a row, and everything I said to you was wrong, would you keep me on your

591
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,880
show? Would you have any confidence in me? Would you listen to me? Mr. Paul, Mr. Bernanke and

592
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,040
the guy at the New York Fed, Tim, somebody every week. They have been dead wrong.

593
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,080
Absolutely. This is what I love about the internet. You can track all this stuff. They

594
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,520
have been wrong. Because they've been lying to us.

595
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:46,400
Would you listen to them? I wouldn't listen to them. Jim, but we all were we all. And this

596
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:52,160
is so funny. The guy from CNBC. Okay. This is not the answer he wants to hear. He doesn't

597
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:58,080
want to hear the death doom and destruction message. No, no, because we want a controlled

598
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:06,400
situation. We don't want any losers. It has to be controlled so we can all kind of smoothly

599
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:13,280
regain. It's not the way it works. I think our audience would love to know from you what

600
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,680
you're actually doing with your money right now. Because you obviously will be seeing

601
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:22,240
some opportunities here. I'm sure you've kept some of your own power to drive. Maybe you

602
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,800
could give our audience some advice as to how Jim Rogers is allocating his capital.

603
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:32,720
Well, I have an enormous amount of cash and I've been using it to buy more Japanese yen,

604
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,320
more Swiss francs, more agricultural products. There's a liquidation phase going on here for

605
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,480
everything is being liquidated. I bought agricultural last week and it's down this week.

606
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,880
So pay close attention to what he's saying. First of all, he's moving into the Japanese

607
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:53,040
yen and the Swiss franc. Those are the safe havens. So if you want to do anything with your money,

608
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,840
buy that. I recommend this. It looks months ago. I told you I'm totally out of the markets.

609
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,920
I've got nothing but cash and gold. I've been very open about that. I've shared that with the

610
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:12,320
chuckleheads and the no agenda audience. I did interviews in the Netherlands for investor magazine.

611
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,400
And I said this very same thing. I've got cash in four different currencies and four different

612
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,120
banks around the world. I've got gold physically in my hands or close enough to it.

613
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:30,080
And of course everyone. I'm crazy. Crazy curry. Now I'm getting emails from people saying,

614
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,000
hey, wow. I'm even being compared. They're putting me in statements with bank directors of like

615
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,120
ING. No, then your curry strategy doesn't sound too stupid now. Yeah. Exactly. But there is a

616
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,640
liquidation process going on. They're liquidating everything. They being the guys you're seeing on TV.

617
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Paulson, Bernanke. Now we've got Paulson's old buddy. He's assistant. Basically his PA is

618
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,640
personal assistant is now spending our money. And essentially blending it back to us.

619
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:12,560
Charging more interest. It's nuts. Let's listen to more of Jim Rogers. You know, they're selling

620
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:18,240
everything inside. But that's what I've covered some shorts. I covered a few shorts here today.

621
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,040
That's what I'm doing with my money now. Let's do that at some point. This got to end. Right.

622
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,280
And at which levels in the markets would you start thinking, you know what companies look

623
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,000
cheap enough for me right now to get back into equities? I'm not sure. I want to buy equities when

624
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,520
the market caves in. I don't think equities are going to come out of this on top. Normally when you

625
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,240
have a panic, the way you make money is you buy the things where the fundamentals have been

626
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,600
unimpaired and they will lead the market coming out. Most equity, I mean Morgan Stanley's not coming

627
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:53,360
out of this unimpaired. So I'm buying our commodities. I'd come out. So funny. Again, he's saying,

628
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:58,240
I'm not going to get back into the market. Are you nuts? I'll buy stuff that's, you know, bricks. I'll

629
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,080
buy oil, probably, although I wouldn't be in oil right now. Because that's going down to 50 or 60

630
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,840
bucks. But he's saying, buy fundamentals, buy real things. Forget the stock market. It's fake.

631
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,920
That's essentially what he's saying. And they don't want to hear this answer. Listen, the only thing

632
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,040
I know that are coming out of this unimpaired was supply and demand is still terribly out of bounds.

633
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,760
And the Japanese Jan and this was right. There's a real feeling at least here in Asia of helplessness.

634
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,080
Watching what's being done in the financial markets here, the disease. The wealth destruction

635
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:33,360
that's happening through no fault of their own. The Asian seem to feel because this was a problem

636
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:39,440
that was primarily a western financial system problem. But Asia is not immune to this.

637
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,640
I happened to agree. I thought it out of rages. Did anybody has the step in and bail out of

638
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,120
a bunch of 29 euros driving miles around? Oh, I love that. Outrageous that anyone has to step in

639
00:35:51,200 --> 00:36:01,040
and bail out a bunch of 29-year-olds driving mouserodies. Absolutely. We nuts. Obama and McCain voted

640
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:08,560
for that. Why? Because they are under control. Money owns all. The money talks.

641
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,280
What about all the people and countries that monitor their manners? Save their money. Didn't

642
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,720
get overextended. And now all of a sudden they're being asked to bail out a bunch of guys on Wall Street

643
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,280
who were incompetent at death and some of them crooks. I found it outrageous. But by the way,

644
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,960
even if it's not outrageous. The way to solve this problem is to let people go bankrupt. All of this

645
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,200
pumping money into the system is not going to save it. You see what the market is saying. The market

646
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,800
says we don't buy that. Let people go bankrupt. Then you will hit bottom and then you will start over.

647
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,400
The people who are sound will take over the assets from the people who are unsound and we will start

648
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,920
over. This is the way the world has worked for a few thousand years. Exactly. This is exactly it.

649
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,880
And Dr. Ron Paul will back him up on that because I've heard him say it. You got to let everything go

650
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,520
bankrupt. You just got to do it. Now, of course, as they were on the way to this controlled financial

651
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,360
economic collapse, they changed the rules in the United States. It made it much harder to actually

652
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,760
go bankrupt because, wow, we don't want to get late. You get away with anything. No, no, no,

653
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,080
that's we're going to take all your real stuff. All the stuff that you actually own that is tangible

654
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:23,040
and you can touch. We're going to take that bandits. Yeah, but Jim, we do want to know the

655
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,120
Lee restructuring of the financial accordingly. We're currently one to throw lots of people out of

656
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:35,760
jobs because we have a little bit because we are a society that no longer understands losers.

657
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,800
Someone has to lose in this game. It's always worked that way. Now, just lots of people got to

658
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:47,280
lose at the same time. It's unfortunate. But any other way will be prolonged and much more painful.

659
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,800
And by the way, we have a responsibility not to let our friends and neighbors just die on the street

660
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,240
because everything's being taken away from them. We have to help them. No one's talking about that.

661
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,760
This is the problem in the global economy at this stage. And that's the issue here, isn't it?

662
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:10,880
We don't want to go back to depression, era, economics just because we cannot manage and

663
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,880
orderly deleveraging of the financial economy. Jeff, we had the worst successes we've had in

664
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,360
the more credit markets in world history. You think we just wake up one morning and say, oh,

665
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,840
well, we had a horrible, horrible period of excess. And now everything's okay. We're just going to

666
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,800
ignore that. We're going to have to take some pain, Jeff. Never before in world history,

667
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,080
well, people able to buy houses with no money down. Many people bought four or five houses with no

668
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:41,440
money down and no job. And then they did it with cars and student loans and credit card loans.

669
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,520
You think we just say, well, that's too bad. We're going to start over. Nobody loses his job.

670
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:51,360
Jeff, leave realistic. You got to see the rest of this interview is just too funny.

671
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,040
The people from CNBC just don't want to take that for an answer. Like, yeah, but we want an orderly.

672
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:03,920
We want don't want anyone to get hurt. That's not the plan, my friends. They mean for you to get hurt.

673
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,920
Utilize your freedom, my friends. Utilize it. We really need to watch out for one another right now.

674
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,800
And the chuckle heads are waking up even the most skeptic. Hey, out of my no two calls and

675
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,280
one days a lot, but I was just listening to the latest daily source code. And it occurred to me

676
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,280
you have overlooked one of the ultimate conspiracy theories. I don't know about that. And this one,

677
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,120
I might actually buy engine. This is Chris from Seattle. The one who always does your full crap

678
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:34,640
about this conspiracy stuff. But this one I actually, I guess. I think it's what is it crazier than a

679
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,240
shithouse rat. That's what you call me, right? See this happening. Something that's reconfigured too.

680
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:48,560
So I find it an interesting quote unquote coincidence. The entire world banking system is

681
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:55,280
melting down at the same time. You know the easiest way to have a United Federation of

682
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:03,600
countries, you know, startfully academy or whatever. You know, the quickest way to get to a global

683
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:11,360
one world governance would be to hold it by the ball through it's first string. So the minute all

684
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:16,160
the banking system is not down, everyone's going to have to reboot their economy. And why not?

685
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,440
Just since we're now in a global market, why don't we just reboot the entire world of

686
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,800
the economy? Everyone's switching over to the exact same currency. It'd be much easier.

687
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,680
When you want to have the economy and when the dollar is not worth anything, and the pound is now

688
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,280
not worth anything. And then the euro is not worth anything. So stability needs to be brought into play.

689
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,440
And no one wants to go to the Rouple. So why not start a new currency altogether and put everyone

690
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,840
under the exact same monetary system all over the world? Or at least we'll put the majority of

691
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:56,240
us under and then bring in the little countries like Zimbabwe later. I can see that happen.

692
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:03,520
That's the first period by and to, anyway, I don't know, it's one of the best I've ever did.

693
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:11,760
Chris, you could not be more clairvoyant. And by the way, you know, I tell you to ignore mainstream

694
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,080
news. There are two recommendations I would make. The financial times, which you can find at

695
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:24,000
ft.com as well as Bloomberg, which you can find at, of course, Bloomberg.com. So yesterday, Chris

696
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,520
won those lines. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said political leaders are discussing

697
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:36,800
the idea of closing the world's financial markets while they quote rewrite the rules of international

698
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:44,320
finance. This was of course on a day when the Dow was went down. But this was the time this was

699
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,880
said the Dow was going down to 8,500. So listen to what he's saying. He's saying, you know,

700
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,800
I'm pretty sure that we're just going to close on the markets rewrite the rules. Yeah, of course,

701
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,000
they're going to rewrite the rules. They're going to change it. They're going to add in all these

702
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,520
carbon credits because they need something that is finite. They need a resource of there's only

703
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,800
so much. Now, of course, this is all bullshit and all made up. And you know, my stance on that,

704
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:18,000
the basic elements of life, the sun, the seas, and water, oxygen, and CO2. It's what the

705
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,200
plants and the trees live on. It's a it's a given take. Of course, we need to clean up the earth

706
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,080
and we need to stop raper and we need to utilize the alternative energy that we already have

707
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,280
access to and we need to let our true creative spirits find more because they are out there.

708
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,480
I'm convinced they've been held back from us. Just look at the work that Tesla was doing over 100

709
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:48,960
years ago. And so of course, the carbon credits, that's going to be the new type of money.

710
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:55,600
And yes, they're going for a one world banking system, a one world financial system. I'm

711
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,320
pretty confident. It's all been set up and orchestrated. The European Union was supposed to be

712
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:05,440
an integrated part of this. Didn't quite happen because the Lisbon Treaty did not pass.

713
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:19,120
And then hours later, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi reversed his comments that leaders

714
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:23,680
are discussing closing the world's financial markets while they quite quote rewrite the rules

715
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,520
of international finance. Berlusconi says, I heard it on the radio. The hypotheses

716
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,920
wasn't put forward by any leader, including myself. Man, he got a call didn't he?

717
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,520
And red phone was going, Silvio, what the fuck are you doing? Don't tell him what we're doing,

718
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:48,080
dude. Don't let him know. Remember when Congress had a secret meeting, closed meeting this

719
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,720
couple months ago. And many congressmen said, no, I don't want to have any part of that,

720
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,160
but a whole bunch of them did go in and they said, well, you know, now we kind of know it's leaked out

721
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,600
through, uh, I think a mainly Australian newspapers, but a number of other mainstream publications

722
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,920
of now basically said, look, they was all about the collapse of the financial system. When it was

723
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,440
going to happen, how was going to happen? And of course, the actual possibility of martial laws,

724
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,440
people see their money dry up. And right now, certainly in the United States, we're all hanging

725
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,120
on to this dream that Obama's going to come in and he's going to save the day and everyone will

726
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:28,240
have a beautiful world. And it's just not true. It doesn't matter if it's McCain or if it's Obama,

727
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,000
and we'll be talking more about how the elections are rigged, how it works the United States,

728
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,240
because there's not just two representatives of the same party, the Democratic and the Republicans.

729
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,360
There are independence with many different and varied views, and they actually kind of all agree

730
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,120
with each other and what should be done. But they're not participating in the debates. I don't have

731
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,200
the money. Good shipment. Obama's going to do a half hour commercial on ABC or probably NBC.

732
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,280
Can we have that cost by a half hour of prime time television? If any idea, there's no way.

733
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,960
And what is America doing? What is the rest of the world doing? We're just stuck to our television

734
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,080
sets. We're completely hypnotized. It's okay, America. Your government is in control. Go back

735
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:16,560
to your living rooms. And please watch American Gladiators. You are free. Even Glenn Beck understands

736
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,480
what's happening. Here's one of his most recent shows. Listen to this. Don't trip you out.

737
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,480
Here we go. It's a recording from YouTube. You and I grew up in

738
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,480
is gone. And maybe it's gone forever. If we don't wake up now, McCain said last time,

739
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:42,800
was anybody stunned by, I want to buy up all the bad mortgages, so there would be no foreclosures

740
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:49,680
as this outrageous as that was that news for you gang. It's already in the bailout bill. Believe

741
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:56,320
it or not, Paulson can do that. He doesn't have to even ask you anymore. There is a global meltdown

742
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:04,800
coming. It is a global depression and one world currency and one world financial system is the end

743
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:11,680
game. China said last week they want one global currency. France said yesterday or the day before

744
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:19,360
that they want one world order, a new world order at the end of this event. Two nights ago,

745
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:27,360
the government used $900 billion of your money to give loans to businesses and guarantee those loans.

746
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:33,440
Did they even ask you? That's your money last night for the first time. The interest rate was

747
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:42,080
cut globally. Yep. Hey man, don't believe me. Believe me on this if you do. We're not going

748
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:48,800
to fix this overnight, but we've got to be awake alert and help each other out and pass the

749
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:56,720
word. Wake people up to what's going on. I wish I had listened 25 years ago, man. They were telling

750
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,520
me that message was in the music I wasn't listening.

751
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:56,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

752
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:14,820
Nightingale, Nightingale, Yeah, Nightingale Yooh刚才, Yeah.

753
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:44,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

754
00:48:44,820 --> 00:49:14,820
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

755
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:44,460
Really, really bums me out that I wasn't paying attention.

756
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:52,140
It's so on came out and like 81 or 82, maybe even earlier than that, David Bowie 1984, that's right, they got cameras,

757
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:58,940
they're watching us, they've got to face recognition, license plate number, recognition, GPS, RFID,

758
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:04,380
and now they've taken our money. Next step, electronic money based on carbon credits.

759
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:10,380
And if you don't behave, they'll just turn off your money. Still time to go out and buy gold,

760
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:17,820
chuckle heads. Look, we're buying a house, needs some real assets, something that they can't take away from us,

761
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:23,820
because my money is no good, it's just as worthless as your money, it's just papers, just entries in a couple of banks,

762
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:31,340
it doesn't really mean anything. And with hyperinflation, which means you put all this money into the market,

763
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:37,500
you print it up, that means the money becomes worth less. That's where the word comes from, of course, worth

764
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:43,980
less. And this is proof is right there, where the dollar went up, gold went up as well. It had to,

765
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:51,500
it had to, because there's no value left to this paper money. As Ron Paul said, cigarettes are worth more,

766
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:56,700
in my case, hell yeah. There are heroes in this, and they're starting to pop up, and I want to

767
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:03,020
bring attention to them. The first hero is a sheriff in Chicago, sheriff, by the way, is very interesting

768
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:08,540
position in the United States. It's pretty high on the on the state level of sheriff, just like the

769
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:14,220
world, the wild west, you know, can do a lot, can say a lot. They don't wear hats anymore and spurs.

770
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:20,860
In fact, if you take a look at the CNN report on this story, show notes of links in the show notes,

771
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:28,380
of course, a daily source code.com. This is Sheriff Thomas J. Dart, and he has been tasked as

772
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,300
all law enforcement in the United States, and you'll see this happen in other countries if it is

773
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:36,140
an already, you just don't have as many reports yet, where, you know, people can't pay their

774
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,540
mortgage, they get kicked out of their house. It's called foreclosure. And the guys walk up, they say,

775
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:44,940
hey, you got to get out and they pack up your shit, they throw it into a van, and you're out,

776
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:50,060
you're out, and they board it up, done. The bank is repossessed. Of course, the government is now

777
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:55,820
repossessed, now that the government owns most of the banks and owns the mortgages directly.

778
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:01,340
So here's what's happening to many people who are renters, think that you're going to be

779
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:08,540
Scott-free, I don't think so. So you're renting a house from someone who has some form of lean or

780
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:13,340
some kind of mortgage or loan against the house that they're renting to you. They default on the

781
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:19,660
mortgage. The bank says, okay, that's ours. Kick the renters out. Kick the renters out. Even though

782
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:25,260
if you've paid your rent on time forever, you're getting kicked out. Your shit is being thrown out

783
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:31,420
on the street, literally. And this true patriot, this true American hero, Sheriff Dart,

784
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:36,220
said, I'm not doing it anymore. I'm just not going to do this. You can, you can sue me. You can do

785
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:43,340
whatever you want, but my people are not going to his people, his staff. We are not going to throw

786
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:50,780
people out on the street who are innocent victims of all of this, innocent victims. It's a great story,

787
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:56,060
great patriot, and I'm so happy that he's doing that. And that's just one of the many, many voices.

788
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:06,460
I want to talk a little bit about some armed forces stuff just to stay with the 1984

789
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:13,260
vibe and the theme of the United Kingdom, which of course collects more data on its citizens and

790
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:17,900
inhabitants of the country than any other country I know, truly get my own nation.

791
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:27,580
Have lost yet again, more data that they've collected, 100,000 members of the armed forces,

792
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:35,900
personnel data gone. It was held by EDS, as supposed to be a real company. That's their main

793
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:43,580
IT contractor. 100,000 records, including names, addresses, passport numbers, dates of birth,

794
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:48,460
driving license, details of those serving in the Army Navy and RAF. The Air Force includes

795
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:54,940
next-of-kind details, as well as information on 600,000 potential services, applicants, and the

796
00:53:54,940 --> 00:54:01,580
names of referees. Officials said it also may include some bank account details. What the hell are

797
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:11,580
they doing with the bank account details? Maybe they didn't even lose it. We just got stolen

798
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:17,740
by another division. They incompetent. We've got to rise up against this. I don't expect

799
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:22,380
that to happen tomorrow. We've got to get a lot more pissed off before all that happens.

800
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:30,380
The Army now being used to find the new black gold. It's going to be water. I think I've said

801
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:38,700
many, many years that water is the next oil. Water that can be as drinkable, that is healthy.

802
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:49,900
Great story on Reuters about that, about American troops in Iraq, securing water, water resources.

803
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:56,540
It's all happening. It's all taking place right before our very eyes. All right, we'll get back

804
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:00,380
that. Let's do a little bit of fun stuff. Just to lift the mood for a second. Because we're not dead yet,

805
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,700
we can still have fun in games. Can we?

806
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:16,460
Hi Adam, it's Matt from Gamesweasel on this week's show. I review we paint them up to blob,

807
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:21,980
sketch a grips with sonic chronicles on the DS. You can win copies of FIFA O9 for the PlayStation 3

808
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:26,060
and we meet the monsters of Games of War 2. That's all the gamesweasel.com.

809
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,980
Hey Adam, how are you doing? Hey Young pretty good. It is hit test number 142.

810
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:42,380
This is considered right away with intro number one.

811
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,180
I want one. I'm sure though.

812
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:52,300
I want your love, um, cheek. I think it is. I want your love.

813
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,860
Yeah. Number two.

814
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,660
Diamond flame.

815
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,020
Move again, Chris Ria. We'll look you think it's over.

816
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,740
I think. Short intro there though.

817
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,140
And number three.

818
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:14,780
That's a tragedy, VG.

819
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:20,620
And good songs, young. It was a financial crisis theme show.

820
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,700
And it's time for the answers in this week. They're all from

821
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:30,540
and this is answer number. Oh, it's good times. She's good times.

822
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,180
I got cheap right at least.

823
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,140
Good times.

824
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:44,140
These are not good times.

825
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,060
You are short again.

826
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:56,460
All right, one star for getting a cheek right. She gets answer number one.

827
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,700
And this is answer number two.

828
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,100
This is rock. She music. She is.

829
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,100
Oh, I was wrong and I want.

830
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:07,260
We're still so cool.

831
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,260
It sounded just like Chris Ria.

832
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,260
Oh, kiss tonight.

833
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:19,260
Just kill and guess who's not in the way the heart is.

834
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,220
That's way.

835
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,540
That's way, that's way.

836
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:33,100
Dance away, rock. She music has answered number two.

837
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,060
And this is answer number three.

838
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,620
The VG. Strategy.

839
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,300
The VG has answered number three.

840
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,740
And this concludes hit this number 142.

841
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,740
So Adam, how did you do this week?

842
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,380
I thought I did better. You only got three out of six.

843
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:18,140
I really thought I was press three. I fully think it's over. It was boxing music.

844
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,340
Let me find that song.

845
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:22,300
All right, the usual place to find the answers to this and any other hits.

846
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,500
And also the links to iTunes. You can buy the tracks featured in it.

847
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:29,100
This online is hit this.mifio.com.

848
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,220
Thank you for playing Adam.

849
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:32,780
Oh, thank you.

850
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:36,060
Don't want else. Thank you for listening. Next week, I hope to be back for another hit this.

851
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,900
So until then, take care. Have fun.

852
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,140
And remember try to think with your heart. Bye-bye.

853
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:53,420
Well, even though I missed out on a young, you give me a great idea.

854
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:57,820
I just went into my library and pulled this one out.

855
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:00,220
Miss Chris Ria, full of you think it's over.

856
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,420
We'll save your tears.

857
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,060
God isn't here.

858
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:35,740
I've been to save my tears.

859
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,340
I'll be where I'll live.

860
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:45,580
Save your cryin' for the day.

861
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:58,860
Oh, if you think it's over, I can take care of my heart.

862
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:04,940
Oh, if you think it's over, tell you why.

863
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,980
She won't know.

864
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:12,300
No one has alwaysносed me.

865
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,260
Look at the morning sun.

866
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,900
Who would give me a kiss?

867
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,700
Well, I just mean God.

868
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:29,100
This day they dream.

869
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:32,780
Such a tragic saying

870
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:44,940
Not your crown, no matter who he is

871
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:49,940
I was one of the pride

872
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:54,940
And I am pride

873
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:58,940
Seed your team

874
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:02,940
That isn't you

875
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:06,940
Who would if you think it's your home

876
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:11,940
All of you say goodbye

877
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,940
Who would if you think it's your home

878
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:19,940
Did you want?

879
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:23,940
If you think it's your home

880
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,940
Did you want?

881
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:31,940
If you think it's your home

882
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:36,940
Did you want?

883
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:39,940
If you think it's your home

884
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:44,940
I'm pride, I'm pride, I'm pride

885
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:49,940
I'm pride, I'm pride, I'm pride

886
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:54,940
Seed your team

887
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:58,940
That isn't you

888
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:02,940
Who would if you think it's your home

889
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:06,940
Did you want?

890
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:11,940
If you think it's your home

891
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:15,940
Did you want?

892
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,940
If you think it's your home

893
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:25,940
I'm pride, I'm pride, I'm pride

894
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:29,940
I'm pride, I'm pride, I'm pride

895
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:33,940
I'm pride, I'm pride

896
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:38,380
How all has always piled up and

897
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,940
I was going to get the morning sun

898
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:46,940
Oh, I can't think it's over

899
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:49,940
Just begun

900
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:56,940
I'll buy you first but one

901
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:01,940
Oh, you have a real good time

902
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:06,940
You say your time

903
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:10,940
Two ways to interpret this song of course

904
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:13,940
You could say, fool if you think it's over

905
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,940
That the crisis is over

906
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:16,940
Or

907
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:18,940
You traitors

908
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:20,940
Governmental traitors

909
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,940
Fool if you think it's over

910
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:23,940
You think we're done?

911
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:24,940
You think we're over?

912
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:25,940
No, we're just getting started

913
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:28,940
It may take another five years, ten years

914
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:30,940
Twenty years

915
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,940
We're not going to let you win

916
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,940
I like you steal from us

917
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,940
We're connected

918
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:38,940
We're protecting the internet with our lives

919
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,940
We have to protect these free channels

920
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:42,940
Keep everything wide open

921
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:45,940
Because that's the one thing that they messed up on

922
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:48,940
And the internet is so completely intertwined

923
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:52,940
And ingrained into society that they can't shut it down

924
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:55,940
But they are definitely going to try and hit you with the last mile

925
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:57,940
And any other place they can

926
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:59,940
You're mobile phone

927
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,940
There's no way they're going to let anything

928
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:02,940
Really through there

929
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:03,940
They don't want to

930
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:04,940
They're setting it all up

931
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:05,940
They're infrastructures coming

932
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,940
So we have to fight against that

933
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,940
We really do have to get pissed off

934
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:11,940
But we got to watch it

935
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,940
People have laughed at me about

936
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,940
What I'm about to tell you

937
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:17,940
This is a story from Wired

938
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,940
Who has he wired from October 10

939
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:21,940
So just yesterday

940
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:23,940
After years of testing

941
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,940
The active denial system

942
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:27,940
The pain ray

943
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:29,940
Which drives off riders

944
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,940
With a microwave like beam

945
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,940
Could finally have it today

946
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:37,940
The army is buying five of the truck-mounted systems for 25 million

947
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,940
Dollars

948
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,940
The great picture of this thing

949
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:45,940
However, the energy weapon

950
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:49,940
May face new hurdles before it shipped off to the battlefield

951
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,940
Which don't think that's just going to be the desert

952
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:55,940
You know that that could be rolling through your street

953
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:59,940
A new report details how the supposedly non-lethal blaster

954
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:03,940
Could be turned into a flesh-frying killer

955
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:07,940
So here's the deal

956
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,940
And this is made by Raytheon, of course

957
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:13,940
It's a microwave

958
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:15,940
For crowd control

959
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,940
They can just sweep this thing across the crowd

960
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:19,940
And what happens is you start to burn up

961
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:21,940
You get really, really hot

962
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:23,940
And of course that will make

963
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:25,940
It's like a super tazer

964
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:27,940
The tazer is just one way of training us to understand

965
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:29,940
What will come next when you see the super tazer on the truck

966
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:31,940
You will walk away

967
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:33,940
You will be much more afraid of this than bullets

968
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:35,940
I'm telling you bullets can miss

969
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,940
This thing you just boop

970
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:39,940
Just shoots out a beam

971
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:41,940
These are they call them

972
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,940
Directed energy weapons

973
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,940
You've heard that here on the daily source code

974
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,940
This is no joke, this is for real

975
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,940
And they're putting these things into service

976
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,940
And they will use them against our own citizens

977
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:53,940
Worldwide

978
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,940
When you start to rise up

979
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:57,940
So we've got to find some effective way

980
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:59,940
To deflect these microwave beams

981
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,940
How fucking science fiction is this?

982
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:03,940
Crowd control with microwave beams

983
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:07,940
And people laugh at me when I say this stuff

984
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:09,940
That career fucking nuts man

985
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:11,940
You're living a science fiction movie

986
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,940
It's in the mainstream media

987
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:15,940
I'm not making it up

988
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,940
Drop.au slash daily source code

989
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,940
By the way, the place you should go pretty much every single morning

990
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:23,940
If you want to see a great collection of mainstream news

991
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:27,940
Pulled into a nice little connect

992
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,940
The dots formats you can really understand

993
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,940
What's going on and what's being said

994
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:33,940
Because it is being said

995
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:35,940
But it's not the headlines

996
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:37,940
It's not what's being pumped into our brains

997
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:39,940
Through television, mainly through television

998
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:41,940
And a lot of it through newspapers

999
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,940
And it's in the newspapers, but it's not on the headline

1000
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:45,940
And this is just a despicable story

1001
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,940
That got plenty of ink

1002
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:49,940
I'm reading the version from the Los Angeles Times

1003
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,940
U.S. intelligence analyst

1004
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:53,940
Eves dropped on personal calls

1005
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:55,940
Between American, over Americans, overseas

1006
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:57,940
And their families back home

1007
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,940
And monitored the communications of workers with a red cross

1008
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:01,940
And other humanitarian organizations

1009
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:03,940
Two military linguists

1010
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:05,940
Have turned whistleblower

1011
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,940
And they've come out and said, hey, you know

1012
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:11,940
We were basically listening to this

1013
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:15,940
We were basically listening to people's pillow talk

1014
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,940
And we did pass around

1015
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,940
You know, almost like the Casey case

1016
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:21,940
I would take tape and we'd pass around this stuff

1017
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,940
Of high ranking officials

1018
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:25,940
Really a lot of fun

1019
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:27,940
Listening to non-people

1020
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,940
You evil bastards

1021
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:31,940
Evil

1022
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,940
What's going on

1023
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:35,940
And a story that I can't

1024
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,940
Relay in its entirety

1025
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:39,940
It's like five web pages

1026
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:41,940
That's from sqi or magazine

1027
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:43,940
You can find it sqi or dot com

1028
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:45,940
Of course, links in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

1029
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,940
This is about a

1030
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,940
U.S. servicemen

1031
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,940
Who

1032
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,940
He'd signed the deal

1033
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,940
With the U.S. Army

1034
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:57,940
He spent his tour

1035
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:59,940
He did what over

1036
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,940
I think two years

1037
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:03,940
Suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder

1038
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,940
His wife left him

1039
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,940
Upon coming back

1040
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:09,940
He had a lot of problems

1041
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:11,940
Understandably so

1042
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:12,940
And he gets a letter

1043
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:13,940
After three years

1044
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,940
And they say, hey, we need

1045
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:17,940
We need your help again

1046
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:19,940
Come on in

1047
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:21,940
He gets certified letters from

1048
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,940
Written statements from sqi

1049
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,940
Atrists to say he's unfit

1050
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:27,940
And they just say, well, you know, hey, next time you come out

1051
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,940
We'll make sure you don't have to go back in

1052
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,940
So it's really the story of him being re-enlisted

1053
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:35,940
And one thing that really freaked me out

1054
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:39,940
He said, you know, so it was a ratio of three to one

1055
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,940
At the office, you know, where you go sign up

1056
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:43,940
Or at the office at Fort wherever he was

1057
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:47,940
So 25% were poor guys like him

1058
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:49,940
Who really had no business being over in

1059
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:51,940
War torn

1060
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:53,940
Deserts in the first place

1061
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:55,940
Throwing depleted uranium

1062
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:57,940
And other people in catching

1063
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:59,940
Fireback

1064
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:01,940
75% are contractors

1065
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:03,940
Blackwater

1066
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,940
And he describes it so well

1067
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:06,940
He says these guys are working

1068
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:08,940
Walking around with basically military porn

1069
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,940
They've got all kinds of holsters and harnesses

1070
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,940
And gadgets and stuff

1071
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:13,940
And they're just getting off on it

1072
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:14,940
They're overweight

1073
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:16,940
And they're horny on death

1074
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:17,940
And military

1075
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:19,940
And they're, you know, they've probably been playing

1076
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:21,940
All these fucking video games all their life

1077
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:23,940
And now they're like, ah, we're going in for real

1078
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:24,940
Let's go fucking

1079
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:25,940
Let's go Nuka

1080
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:27,940
Nuts

1081
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:31,940
Nuts

1082
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,940
Only one thing you can really say about that

1083
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,940
Singin' y'all

1084
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:59,940
Who the god

1085
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:01,940
Why didn't it hurt?

1086
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,940
I have to live

1087
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:04,940
That doesn't to make

1088
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,940
Oh, oh, oh

1089
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:08,940
I can smell

1090
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:11,940
Cause it leaves the storm

1091
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:13,940
Till I'll be safe

1092
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:16,940
What leaves tears

1093
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:18,940
And the office of Fort where they're

1094
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:20,940
When they're so good to fight

1095
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:22,940
And lose their life

1096
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:24,940
I still walk

1097
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:26,940
Look at God y'all

1098
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,940
Why didn't it hurt?

1099
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:29,940
I have to live

1100
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:30,940
Yeah, get out of here

1101
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:31,940
Yeah, get out of here

1102
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:34,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1103
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,940
Why didn't it hurt?

1104
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:37,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1105
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:39,940
I have to live

1106
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:40,940
Listen to me

1107
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:41,940
Whoa

1108
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:42,940
It ain't nothing

1109
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,940
What a heartbreak

1110
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:45,940
Whoa

1111
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:46,940
It ain't nothing

1112
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:47,940
What a heartbreak

1113
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,940
Whoa

1114
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:50,940
Oh, oh, oh

1115
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:51,940
It ain't nothing

1116
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:53,940
What a heartbreak

1117
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:55,940
The bottom of our home

1118
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:57,940
Blows memories

1119
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:59,940
What is constant means

1120
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:01,940
With an incompetent generation

1121
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:04,940
Intention, indestention

1122
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:05,940
Who was me now?

1123
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:08,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh

1124
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:10,940
Good God y'all

1125
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:12,940
Why didn't it hurt?

1126
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,940
I have to live

1127
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:14,940
Yeah, get out of here

1128
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:15,940
Yeah, get out of here

1129
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:16,940
Yeah, get out of here

1130
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

1131
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:21,940
Why didn't it hurt?

1132
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,940
I have to live

1133
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:24,940
Listen to me

1134
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:25,940
Whoa

1135
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:27,940
It ain't nothing

1136
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:28,940
What a heartbreak

1137
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:30,940
Whoa

1138
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:31,940
It ain't nothing

1139
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:32,940
What a heartbreak

1140
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:35,940
It ain't nothing

1141
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,940
What a heartbreak

1142
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:38,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh

1143
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:39,940
It ain't nothing

1144
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:41,940
What a heartbreak

1145
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:42,940
The heartbreak

1146
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:44,940
It ain't nothing

1147
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:46,940
I'm afraid it can't break

1148
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:50,940
Walking in light, you can always take it away

1149
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:52,940
Oh, wow!

1150
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,940
But God, y'all!

1151
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:56,940
What do you call?

1152
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:58,940
Absolutely!

1153
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,940
Shit again!

1154
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:02,940
Whoa!

1155
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:04,940
Whoa!

1156
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:05,940
What do you call?

1157
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:07,940
Oh, absolutely!

1158
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:08,940
Listen to me!

1159
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:09,940
Whoa!

1160
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:12,940
Nothing but heartbreak!

1161
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:14,940
Whoa!

1162
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:15,940
Friend only!

1163
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:17,940
The heart to take her!

1164
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:18,940
Whoa!

1165
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:20,940
Please help me!

1166
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,940
I can't believe it!

1167
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:23,940
It is not complete!

1168
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:24,940
Believe it!

1169
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:25,940
Believe it!

1170
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:26,940
Believe it!

1171
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:28,940
They say we must find!

1172
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:30,940
To keep our freedom!

1173
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:34,940
But God knows this can't be open away!

1174
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,940
Whoa!

1175
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:37,940
Whoa!

1176
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:39,940
Who are you?

1177
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:41,940
But you can't!

1178
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:42,940
You tell!

1179
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:43,940
Once again, the message has been in the music

1180
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:45,940
for decades!

1181
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:47,940
I am so angry of myself!

1182
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:48,940
Disappointed!

1183
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:49,940
I didn't pay attention!

1184
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:51,940
That was a good hit record, you know?

1185
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:52,940
Hey, of course!

1186
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:53,940
War!

1187
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:54,940
What is a good for?

1188
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:55,940
Whatever!

1189
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:56,940
I'm not paying it!

1190
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:59,940
I'll just go back to my living room and turn on American Gladiators.

1191
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:03,940
At one star on the Charlie episode number 7-9 or 8 coming to you from San Francisco

1192
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:04,940
as if you had forgotten.

1193
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:08,940
Hopefully you're doing what you did last week with this extended form

1194
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:11,940
out of show and just putting on the speakers chillin out.

1195
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:12,940
Relaxing.

1196
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:15,940
And just taking it all in.

1197
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:23,940
Still the biggest war, as far as I'm concerned, that is going on for our young, our daughters

1198
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:26,940
are 9 to 12 year olds.

1199
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:28,940
I'm going to bring up Gardasil again.

1200
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:31,940
This is the vaccine invented by Mark.

1201
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:35,940
Rushed through the federal drug administration program

1202
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:40,940
and other certification agencies worldwide,

1203
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:43,940
a fantastic to watch how this marketing machine is running.

1204
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:48,940
It must cost them hundreds of millions to do what they're doing now.

1205
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:50,940
But you cannot trust this.

1206
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:55,940
And we heard from Franco, a medical doctor, earlier in the week,

1207
01:13:55,940 --> 01:14:01,940
who explained very eloquently the problems with this vaccination.

1208
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:02,940
Because people think of vaccines.

1209
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:06,940
I think of polio and measles and some of that stuff.

1210
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:08,940
Of course, but they've taken hold of this.

1211
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:11,940
This is the next wave for the pharmaceuticals to make so much money.

1212
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:16,940
Now that a lot of these other drugs, many of which I'm convinced are just poisonous,

1213
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:18,940
have run out the patents of run out.

1214
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:22,940
So they can't screw you for it.

1215
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:27,940
Okay, this is a report from Toronto.

1216
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:31,940
I'm just going to read through this with you because it's really important that you take this information.

1217
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:34,940
And particularly if you're considering vaccinating your child.

1218
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:37,940
And by the way, it's only been approved for 9 to 12 year olds.

1219
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,940
They're going to do boys next.

1220
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:42,940
Medical health authorities have repeatedly assured us that

1221
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:46,940
Gardasil, the vaccine injection given the young girls to allegedly prevent

1222
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,940
cervical cancer is perfectly safe.

1223
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:52,940
For example, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization,

1224
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:55,940
group of medical specialists endorsed the vaccine last February.

1225
01:14:55,940 --> 01:15:00,940
The Society of Gynecological Oncologist of Canada claims the vaccine is safe as does

1226
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:05,940
Dr. Dave Butler Jones, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, the Canadian Pediatric Society

1227
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:10,940
and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada have also endorsed the vaccine.

1228
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,940
Of course, because they're all making money.

1229
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:15,940
About 500 bucks is what it costs for the treatment.

1230
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:20,940
And it's just a treatment and you might need more later on because they don't even know if it works.

1231
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:25,940
Three medical authorities have ever puzzled and also indignant that the use of this vaccine

1232
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:30,940
still remains controversial ever since it was rolled out at lightning speed.

1233
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:35,940
After Ottawa announced they 300 million funding packages for participant provinces.

1234
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:36,940
So this is not works.

1235
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:41,940
The pharmaceutical company comes up with some bullshit story about something that's not necessary.

1236
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,940
And then they get government buy-in.

1237
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:44,940
There's all the money.

1238
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:45,940
That that is so huge.

1239
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:47,940
All this medical stuff.

1240
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:50,940
The money that flows through that.

1241
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:54,940
Many young people get paid off, bought off or just convinced otherwise.

1242
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:55,940
The hookers.

1243
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:56,940
I'm sure.

1244
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:57,940
Any legal drugs.

1245
01:15:58,940 --> 01:15:59,940
To rush this shit through.

1246
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:02,940
If you only took six, six months, that didn't even do all the tests.

1247
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:03,940
But it's okay.

1248
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:04,940
It'll be all right.

1249
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:06,940
Just inject this into your daughters.

1250
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:07,940
We'll do it through the school system.

1251
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:08,940
Yeah.

1252
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:10,940
We'll do it through cool commercials on television.

1253
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:11,940
Yeah.

1254
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:12,940
Peer pressure.

1255
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:18,940
This is the same company that brought you Viox.

1256
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:19,940
Do you remember Viox?

1257
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:26,940
Merck, the manufacturer of Gardasil also developed a mucher claim.

1258
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:31,940
Pain killer called Viox that was subsequently used by thousands of individuals suffering from arthritis.

1259
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:35,940
Unfortunately, this is just from a couple of years ago.

1260
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:38,940
The drug had the side effect of causing heart attacks and strokes.

1261
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:41,940
As a result, the medication was taken off the market in 2004.

1262
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:44,940
And Merck is still facing thousands of class actions,

1263
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:47,940
and there's also a amount of billions of dollars in claims.

1264
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:50,940
Once and more examples of medicine that was always safe.

1265
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:51,940
It's approved.

1266
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:52,940
You can use it.

1267
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:53,940
Go ahead and take it.

1268
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:56,940
The shit we're now going to put into our daughter's bodies.

1269
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,940
Nine year olds.

1270
01:16:58,940 --> 01:16:59,940
His one.

1271
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:00,940
1960s.

1272
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:05,940
The little mind was pronounced a safe drug for pregnant women experiencing morning sickness.

1273
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:11,940
It was not safe as thousands of adults with flipper arms and legs can attest.

1274
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:12,940
It goes to 1960s.

1275
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:15,940
Well, of course, there were some other things going on.

1276
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:17,940
The birth control pill was developed in the 60s.

1277
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:20,940
Women were assured that it's used had no harmful side effects.

1278
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:22,940
Go ahead, take it.

1279
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:24,940
Don't worry, be happy.

1280
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:29,940
Studies now report the pill can be the cause of greatly increased risk of stroke, heart attack, blood,

1281
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:31,940
clots of taken for eight years or more.

1282
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:34,940
That is from the birth of Journal of Medicine from September 2007.

1283
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:38,940
It's only taken us 40 years to figure it out.

1284
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:45,940
Between 1938 and 1971 as 4 million US women and many Canadian women took the drug.

1285
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:46,940
DES.

1286
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:47,940
Remember this?

1287
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:48,940
DES?

1288
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:51,940
Dethilistobestrol?

1289
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:54,940
DES was to prevent miscarriage.

1290
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:59,940
Darders of these women were exposed to DES in utero in the womb.

1291
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:04,940
They've experienced a range of structural reproductive tract abnormalities.

1292
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:08,940
So it was meant to actually prevent miscarriage.

1293
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:11,940
And now it's poor women.

1294
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:16,940
Have all kinds of abnormalities in their uterus, their cervix of vagina.

1295
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:20,940
Incidents of abnormality occurs in 18% of the cases.

1296
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,940
Hey, nice testing, guys.

1297
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:24,940
Jesus.

1298
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:30,940
2001's 15 million women in the US alone as well as millions of women in Canada and abroad.

1299
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:33,940
We're taking hormone replacement therapy, HRT.

1300
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:38,940
I remember Patricia was taking HRT and I started reading about this around 2002.

1301
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:40,940
And I said, honey, you got to stop this shit.

1302
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:41,940
This is killing people.

1303
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:42,940
It really is.

1304
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:43,940
It's fucked up.

1305
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:46,940
And she called her doctor said, and I haven't heard about this.

1306
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:47,940
I don't know anything about it.

1307
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:48,940
And then I sent him the articles.

1308
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:49,940
He started looking into it.

1309
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:51,940
A month later he said, holy shit.

1310
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:53,940
I've been doing some research.

1311
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:54,940
Stop.

1312
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:57,940
We got to stop.

1313
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:02,940
July 2002, estrogen therapy was exposed as a hazard to health rather than a benefit.

1314
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:06,940
It was found to constitute a potential health risk for postmen to pause a women by increasing

1315
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:09,940
risk of heart disease, stroke, blood clots, and breast cancer.

1316
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:12,940
My wife has heart disease now.

1317
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:18,940
Makes me so angry.

1318
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:20,940
God, just read the rest of this article.

1319
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:27,940
And I also put a link into the FDA, actual link from the FDA.gov website where they approve

1320
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:29,940
a guardazil.

1321
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:36,940
And it tells you that they haven't actually produced cancer by injecting the actual virus.

1322
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,940
We're not quite sure which strain it'll lead to.

1323
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,940
It's like a fucking legal document.

1324
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:41,940
It might work.

1325
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:42,940
Kind of work could work.

1326
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:43,940
And they're going to do this for boys.

1327
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:44,940
And they're going to continue.

1328
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:46,940
Stop this shit.

1329
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:48,940
We can't allow this to happen.

1330
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:50,940
I don't care how many people think vaccinations are good.

1331
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:53,940
That maybe something has changed.

1332
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:55,940
Do you think since we had polio vaccinations?

1333
01:19:55,940 --> 01:20:01,940
Maybe they've taken the concept of being able to shoot something into our children as an opportunity

1334
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:02,940
to make money.

1335
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:06,940
And God knows what else they might be thinking about it.

1336
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:12,940
And you watch the avian board, bird flu, the H5N1 strain that, of course,

1337
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:17,940
has maybe only allegedly killed 115 people in 15 years.

1338
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:24,940
Oh, this is the new $1.7 billion pipeline for the medical companies.

1339
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:26,940
And they're going to start giving you primers.

1340
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:27,940
It's already taken place.

1341
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:33,940
So we have, it's not quite ready for the bird flu, but here take this primer shot.

1342
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:34,940
It's like stockpiling.

1343
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:37,940
Only we stockpiling in your body for in case it comes.

1344
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:40,940
You watch these messages will be coming.

1345
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:42,940
They will be coming.

1346
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:47,940
I'm just saying this to help you.

1347
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:48,940
That's all.

1348
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:50,940
It's why I'm passionate about this shit.

1349
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,940
Hello, this is Charles your drunk Londoner.

1350
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:56,940
I'm just saying to say, I'm not finally leaving an audio message to say,

1351
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:57,940
Roger Smalls.

1352
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:00,940
I'm so glad you called this lovely to hear from you.

1353
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,940
Hope you're well.

1354
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:04,940
Hope you weren't actually in the clink.

1355
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:07,940
And that everything's all good.

1356
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:11,940
It was nice to hear from Roger earlier on in the week.

1357
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:12,940
All right.

1358
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:14,940
I got to play one from my, my lovely lady P.

1359
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:18,940
And Christina, because I miss and both so incredibly much.

1360
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:21,940
But looks like I'm going home mid week for a couple days before I come back.

1361
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:24,940
Can't wait because I can dream about you girls.

1362
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:26,940
And I do.

1363
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:28,940
It's the Charlie.

1364
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:29,940
No, no.

1365
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:31,940
No time.

1366
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:35,940
Each different falls for fire.

1367
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:38,940
I know.

1368
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:43,940
I need the remedy to cure this over.

1369
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:47,940
I can't dream about you.

1370
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:52,940
If I can't help you tonight.

1371
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:56,940
I can dream about you.

1372
01:21:56,940 --> 01:22:01,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1373
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:05,940
I'm gonna dream about you.

1374
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:09,940
If I can't help you tonight.

1375
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:13,940
I can dream about you.

1376
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:18,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1377
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:23,940
Who will be inside the world?

1378
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:26,940
I don't see under fire.

1379
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:31,940
I'm gonna be all alone.

1380
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:34,940
Now here, there's no one who's crazy.

1381
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:38,940
We're lonely for you.

1382
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:43,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1383
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:48,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1384
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:51,940
I can dream about you.

1385
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:56,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1386
01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:00,940
I'm gonna dream about you.

1387
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:05,940
I know how to hold it just fine.

1388
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:08,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1389
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:11,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1390
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:17,940
Who will be inside the world?

1391
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:21,940
I don't see under fire.

1392
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:26,940
I'm gonna be all alone.

1393
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:31,940
I'm gonna be all alone.

1394
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:38,940
I can dream about you.

1395
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:43,940
I can dream about you.

1396
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:54,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1397
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:59,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1398
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:05,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1399
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:07,940
I don't understand it.

1400
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:09,940
Can't dream about mine.

1401
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:13,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1402
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:19,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1403
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:24,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1404
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:43,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1405
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:49,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1406
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:53,940
You know how to hold it just fine.

1407
01:24:53,940 --> 01:25:01,380
very around 1991 and missing every single time I hear one of his songs and he wrote a lot

1408
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:05,740
from our living in America James Brown he wrote that note a hand race

1409
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:08,940
free ride and a gewinter group

1410
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:14,580
right musician is that guy

1411
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:22,140
hey I found a fantastic clip on the source code drop at drop.io slash daily source code

1412
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:28,860
the place we also leave comments links other files songs anything you can think of

1413
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:30,860
and it was of

1414
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:34,620
johnlin and yoko on on a usually

1415
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:39,900
footage of them is pretty shitty quality wise and this is this is a really good footage

1416
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,500
and it's from

1417
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:44,140
let me see

1418
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:49,100
so I must have been from late seventies let me see

1419
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:52,940
yeah oh no I'm sorry a nineteen

1420
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:55,180
eighty i think

1421
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:57,180
yeah seventy nine or eighty

1422
01:25:57,180 --> 01:26:01,260
they may even be earlier than that i think it's uh... it's film footage as well

1423
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:04,140
and uh... here's a guy who uh... hand

1424
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:07,740
he really he really uh... was switched on pretty early i think that that's what

1425
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:09,420
happens you know

1426
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:15,740
you get a certain amount of uh... finances and fame and recognition or

1427
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:18,780
critical acclaim whatever it is and you start looking for more and that's when you're

1428
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:21,500
i start to open up at least that's what happened with me

1429
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:25,740
and then you see the true travesty that you've probably contributed to in the world

1430
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:29,900
and i just was a little piece of uh... have johnlin and uh... talking about uh...

1431
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:33,900
our overlords the governments that they're evil

1432
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:37,740
and uh... and not cases

1433
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:39,500
but uh... sit on a view

1434
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,300
our old officers run by

1435
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:43,820
insane people

1436
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:46,540
for insane objects and objectives

1437
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:51,100
yeah and i think that's what i suggest when i was sixteen and twelve

1438
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:55,740
way down the line i mean i wish i had had the same johnlin

1439
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:59,900
wish i'd known this when i was sixteen or twelve

1440
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:03,340
had to have to turn forty before i freaking figured it out but i expected

1441
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:05,580
differently all through my life

1442
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:07,980
it's the same thing of expressing all the time

1443
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:11,180
but now i can put it into that sentence i think we've been

1444
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:18,620
run by maniacs from maniacal means uh... run by maniacs

1445
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:19,900
for

1446
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:22,620
maniacal means

1447
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:25,420
if anybody can put on paper what

1448
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:28,300
our government and the american government et cetera

1449
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:32,460
and the russian china dot what they are actually trying to do

1450
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,860
you know on how would what they think they're doing

1451
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:39,500
i'd be very pleased to know what they think they're doing i think they're all insane

1452
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:42,860
now but i'm liable to be put away as insane put expressing

1453
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:48,140
passageway as being insane or a sassanated

1454
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:49,500
saying about it

1455
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,780
every country's had it of an evolution for one reason or the others

1456
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:55,500
not one of them has the freedom we're all talking about

1457
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,260
so we're saying give peace a chance

1458
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:59,900
you know like nobody's ever done it before

1459
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,060
and it's not a matter of

1460
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:04,300
we're not thinking in terms of ten years

1461
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:07,260
we're thinking in terms of peace forever you know

1462
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:13,700
All right, take a look at that because there's a lot of good information that John and actually I've never been to be a Yoko fan

1463
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:18,500
But I have to say that I can see where he actually explains their relationship in this clip

1464
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:23,020
It's about 10 minutes link in the show notes a daily source code calm definitely worth checking out

1465
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:28,440
Because we do have to work towards that and you know, do you remember when

1466
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:33,700
War is over those posters everywhere that John and Yoko put up

1467
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:41,660
So it was a very valiant effort, but it clearly didn't work now. I think we have to we have to have a violent revolution

1468
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:49,900
And it doesn't have to come to blows, but we have to show our strength because we have the power in numbers

1469
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:53,580
We actually have the power we elect our government officials

1470
01:28:53,860 --> 01:29:00,360
We have to remind them of that we are the ones that have that power don't get sucked into their stupid ass games

1471
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:05,680
This Obama McCain race is a sham. It's a television show

1472
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:10,800
It's like American Gladiators. It's all set up by the commission for presidential debates

1473
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:16,560
They don't allow any of the other presidential candidates of true political parties to appear on television

1474
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,680
Which is the whole reason why Dr. Ron Paul ran as Republican?

1475
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:23,560
He of course didn't make it still didn't have the money didn't have enough movement

1476
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:30,240
But his message is really coming through and it's these scams and this injustice that we have to expose

1477
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:36,200
That's how we get our people who really represent the people into the places that we need to have them

1478
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:41,840
Hello, I don't they out the carry. Oh, shit. I how can I even have comic strip blogger?

1479
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,840
Comics strip

1480
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,200
Comics strip

1481
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,560
Comics strip

1482
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:57,960
All right, see as be what's up my friend my European correspondent

1483
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:03,440
Yes, let's disband the commission on presidential debates in USA

1484
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:12,920
So that your left libertarians could get president too and we're guiding you despite crisis meetings

1485
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:16,400
European Union failed to agree a common action

1486
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:23,760
Against a common action against financial crisis. This country is only focused on some interest and

1487
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:28,160
some bailing out local banks and cutting interest rates

1488
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:34,800
No come on you bail out. So this is means that the end of European Union no

1489
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,920
Do have to avoid your opinion was

1490
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:45,760
You're up needs you so you will live long and prosper

1491
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:52,080
Yes, they European Union commission work for us now. They don't now they don't see SP

1492
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:58,400
They don't it's all gonna merge into one one-world government. They they don't work for you

1493
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,840
Then it worked for me look at this

1494
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:05,840
It's exactly how it started started with a monetary system the European economic community and

1495
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:10,760
Before you knew it we had the same money and then all of a sudden they're making the laws in Brussels and in

1496
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:13,760
Strasbourg with that horrible thing looks like the tower of Babel

1497
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:20,120
That's what's going on. It's almost been prophesized you can read revelation lots of people are equating into that

1498
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:29,200
Okay, so just briefly on the upcoming elections. This is really important. You know, and I've been talking to a lot of people

1499
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,240
And yes, I understand that a lot of

1500
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:37,680
Americans will want to vote for Senator Obama because he appears to be the lesser of two evils

1501
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:42,320
He's young. He's hip. He's good looking. He looks like he walked out of the pages of GQ

1502
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:48,880
But just like McCain he's all for the same things. Ah, they difference some numbers

1503
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:54,800
$5,000 versus two and a half thousand dollars versus a tax credit versus only to a certain amount

1504
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:59,840
I mean, it's all the same thing and they'll never do it. Oh, yeah, we're gonna stop the war in Iraq

1505
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,640
We can get people out and we'll move more to Afghanistan

1506
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:07,040
They both voted for the bailout. It they are representing the same people

1507
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,560
And there's a fantastic article on rents.com

1508
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,120
title of it is Soros Brzinski

1509
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,640
Brutchaton

1510
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:15,680
Rodman

1511
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:23,520
Running Obama you need to look at who is behind this man and what their plans are and their published authors

1512
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:30,480
They have written many many white papers their plans are clear and known all you have to do is go and read the information

1513
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,280
Now we know who's behind McCain

1514
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:38,320
We know that call roe is running the show the best television executive in the business

1515
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:43,200
We know that the the grand show is being made by him, but we also know the motors behind it

1516
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:49,280
It's exactly what Bush has been doing. It's those guys. Okay, who report back to Wall Street and corporations?

1517
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:54,960
Now go over and look at what these guys are doing Soros Brzinski. They're Wall Street

1518
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,520
They've got Obama in their pocket

1519
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:01,840
Okay, he'll make you feel good about them fucking you

1520
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:08,640
All right, we'll feel very patriotic. We'll feel very American. We'll think that it's all gonna be right

1521
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:13,680
But it's just gonna be more of the same with a nice little bit of icing on top

1522
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:21,200
Please read what these people are doing the next bubble is infrastructure

1523
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:24,160
That's what this article prophesies as I have to agree with it

1524
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:30,800
So this is happening all over the world. I've seen this happen in Europe and I've seen the horrible things that it brings about

1525
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:34,480
privatizing our our roads our bridges

1526
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:41,680
Our water our electricity everything will be privatized everything will be run by big companies

1527
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:45,680
It will will be in effect no open market will be paying exorbitant prices

1528
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:51,920
That's the next bubble that's going to take place and it'll all be based on carbon credits and all kinds of other

1529
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,360
crap

1530
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:58,160
But the thing that I want to warn you for and God, you know, I really at this point

1531
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:07,920
I hope Obama wins because the zombies who actually believe that they have a choice will be so angry for all the wrong reasons

1532
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:14,160
If he doesn't win so I'm willing to sit it out we can go for more years we can go five years

1533
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:20,880
I'm I'm happy to do it just give me a microphone and able to live in a MacBook Pro and I'm good to go

1534
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:25,760
I'll continue pointing it out so let's have Obama be the president and along the way

1535
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:30,960
I'll point out every single thing that is really evil about the entire system behind him

1536
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:35,760
He is programmed he truly believes he's doing right nothing wrong with that

1537
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:42,960
I'm not attacking this man, but just like John McCain run by Wall Street run by huge corporations run by

1538
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:48,080
Oh, yes the new world order here me now believe me later

1539
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,120
And that my friends is just a fact of life

1540
01:34:54,080 --> 01:35:00,160
Nothing you can do about it, but be aware because our day will come when true changes in our life

1541
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,480
That's what all the people say

1542
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,800
You're riding high and April

1543
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,920
Shot down in me

1544
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:16,480
But I know I'm gonna change that too

1545
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:22,480
When I'm back on top that going top and you

1546
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I said that's life

1547
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:30,640
And this one here's it received

1548
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:34,640
Some people get their kicks

1549
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,600
Stopping on a dream

1550
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:41,760
But I don't let it get me down

1551
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:44,240
Oh

1552
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:48,720
This final world it keeps spinning around

1553
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:56,720
I've been a must have a girlfriend, a boyfriend, a poet, a born and a king

1554
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:02,720
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing

1555
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,560
Each time I find myself

1556
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,120
Flat on my face

1557
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:15,840
I pick myself right off and get back in the rain

1558
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,560
That's liar

1559
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:22,560
I can't deny it

1560
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,840
I thought of quitting baby

1561
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,280
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it

1562
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:33,840
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try

1563
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:39,760
I jump right on a big bird and then I fly

1564
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:45,840
I've been up and over and over and over and over and

1565
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,400
I fall in a king

1566
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:51,760
I've been up and down and over and out

1567
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,000
And I know one thing

1568
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,240
Each time I find myself

1569
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,240
Flat on my face

1570
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:07,200
I just pick myself right off and get back in the rain

1571
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,680
That's liar

1572
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:11,280
I fly

1573
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:14,000
And I can't deny it

1574
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,840
Many times I've fallen and come now

1575
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,520
But my heart won't buy it

1576
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,640
But if there's nothing shaking

1577
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:24,640
Come this year to lie

1578
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:30,800
I'm gonna roll myself up

1579
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:34,080
If you'll be a big ball

1580
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,800
And I

1581
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,920
Frank Sinatra that's life

1582
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,080
Hell no

1583
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,040
That's the stuff

1584
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,920
The moon is freedom is made of chocolate

1585
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:51,680
Turn off the TV, stop reading the stupid newspaper

1586
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:55,120
Go outside, walk around, enjoy it, rain, snow

1587
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,880
Sunshine, breathe

1588
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:02,880
That is what your life is about and we just keep on going

1589
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:09,920
Adam says uh, bull co you asked for comments from people who are doing something about the current situation

1590
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,920
What are you doing? Well here's what I'm doing one

1591
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:16,480
I've been reading rise and fall of the third right to broaden my understanding of how evil

1592
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:19,280
People can come to power very interesting for example

1593
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:25,440
Hitler did most of his invasions on sunday because it would catch people off guard and there would be less news coverage

1594
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:34,960
And more even more scary in the early days Hitler achieved his power largely through legal means and only started his illegal actions once he had control of the media with in Germany

1595
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:42,240
But by then a surprising number of people around the world had accepted him as the legal ruler of Germany

1596
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:44,640
exactly what

1597
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:53,520
With question was on the first presidential debate when you rule the country what are you going to do when you rule the country as Jim the moderator when you rule the country

1598
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:56,240
Number two ballcoads

1599
01:38:56,240 --> 01:39:00,800
I'm becoming more and more annoyed over the headlock that the Dems and Republicans have over our media

1600
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:06,320
I've been vocally complaining to them about this fact. I had an exchange with AARP magazine yesterday for instance

1601
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:12,800
In which I told them that their criteria of only accepting candidates with 5% of the popular polls was horse shit and told them why

1602
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:20,240
It's ridiculous to assume that the most qualified candidates are the ones that have managed to buy their way into the two major parties boy

1603
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:21,600
This is such a battle

1604
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:26,160
Thanks for a great show even I internet ballco says absolutely it is ridiculous

1605
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:29,920
The person who is quote going to rule the country

1606
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:36,560
It's not allowed on television. We have four very qualified independent candidates they're not allowed any airtime

1607
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:41,980
But there's plenty of airtime for Britney Spears for Lindsey lowhand Amy Whitehouse and all this other

1608
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:49,980
Crap that we seem to care about why can't we give up some of that airtime? No because we buy our presidents the way they are sold

1609
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:54,860
Just like washing powder. That's what this country is doing to you America

1610
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:58,140
That's what your leaders are doing

1611
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:01,340
selling you soap on a rope

1612
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:10,460
But together we can get by we can change it. Oh, I may not witness that change. I may be long getting gone

1613
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:15,420
But all of Virginia's one little stepping stone towards true freedom

1614
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:18,700
The power that we harness ourselves

1615
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:23,980
That we need to share in these times of trouble and despair

1616
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:29,260
With a little help for my friends. I can do whatever I set up to do

1617
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:33,100
And so can you

1618
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:47,420
What would it do if I say out of two

1619
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:51,100
Would you stand up? Oh, I don't

1620
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:57,980
Let me all ears and I'll sing you song

1621
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,900
I will try not to sing out again

1622
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:05,580
Oh

1623
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:12,460
Oh

1624
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:42,460
Oh

1625
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:11,740
That's

1626
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:18,380
I need someone

1627
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:23,740
Oh

1628
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:27,740
oh

1629
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:33,740
I'm so proud of you, I'm so proud of you

1630
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:37,740
Baby, I'm so proud of you

1631
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:41,740
I'm so proud of you, I'm so proud of you

1632
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:47,740
I'm so proud of you, I'm so proud of you

1633
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:53,740
I'm so proud of you, I'm so proud of you

1634
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:59,740
I'm so proud of you, I'm so proud of you

1635
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:03,740
I'm so proud of you, I'm so proud of you

1636
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:06,940
I'm so proud of you, I'm so proud of you

1637
01:43:06,940 --> 01:43:11,180
I'm so proud of you, I'm so proud of you

1638
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:16,180
But a show feels like metal

1639
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:22,180
Don't you know I'm all alone making a noise

1640
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:27,180
I'm all alone making a noise

1641
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:32,180
I'm all alone trying with a tool

1642
01:43:42,180 --> 01:43:46,060
Oooooooh

1643
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:50,680
That isn't where I fear you belong

1644
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:53,180
Oh, let's come in someone

1645
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:56,180
Don't you think?

1646
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:04,160
Oh, yeah yeah

1647
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:06,160
I'm going to die, I'm going to die

1648
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:08,160
I'm going to die, I'm going to die

1649
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,160
I'm going to die, I'm going to die

1650
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:12,160
I'm going to die, I'm going to die

1651
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:14,160
I'm going to die, I'm going to die

1652
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:16,160
I'm going to die, I'm going to die

1653
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:18,160
I'm going to die, I'm going to die

1654
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:22,160
I'm going to die, I'm going to die

1655
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:24,160
I'm going to die, I'm going to die

1656
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:26,160
I'm going to die, I'm going to die

1657
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:28,160
I'm going to die, I'm going to die

1658
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,160
I'm going to die, I'm going to die

1659
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:32,160
I'm going to die, I'm going to die

1660
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:34,160
I'm going to die, I'm going to die

1661
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:36,160
I'm going to die

1662
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:38,160
I'm going to die

1663
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:40,160
I'm going i'm going to die

1664
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:42,160
I'm going to die

1665
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:44,160
I'm going to die

1666
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:48,160
I'm going to die

1667
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:50,160
I'm going to die

1668
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,160
I'm going to die

1669
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:57,160
I'm going to die

1670
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:58,160
I'm going to die

1671
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:03,400
All card is October 14th, and this has been prophesized around the globe, of course,

1672
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:11,240
this information not being relayed in mainstream media and who knows what the truth is,

1673
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:18,920
but the 14th of October, the word is that will be saved.

1674
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:24,000
And this would be by surfacing of an alien spaceship.

1675
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,560
The word Alabama has been mentioned, we don't know if it's going to be above Alabama or

1676
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:34,080
somewhere else, and I'm not giving you this as empirical proof of anything.

1677
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:40,520
I'm saying that it's being talked about, and it's the ex-factor, now the wild card in

1678
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:46,080
all this may las, where melee, as you might say, wouldn't be amazing if hope came from

1679
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:47,080
above.

1680
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:51,360
It actually can happen, and it's often darkest before dawn.

1681
01:45:51,360 --> 01:46:02,360
You can't manufacture a miracle, the silence was beautiful, that day, though,

1682
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:14,480
although it's getting too cynical, cash on just physical, these days.

1683
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:26,320
You realize everyone in me, but can't know how far I'm living, yeah.

1684
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:38,280
Every night you would meet the feet, it cry as a blind heart, if you can't wake up

1685
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:50,320
in the morning, because you're made last week in the night, if you're lost, you're

1686
01:46:50,320 --> 01:47:01,840
trying to lonely, and controlling, try as you might, be your father, love your own

1687
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:14,840
baby, may I find it that the end of the day, you won't be lost, I'm trying to lonely

1688
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:26,360
or something, you won't come your way, if you can't set on the radio, lap should be

1689
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:39,120
here you, each day, you'll be fresh to cast the unsuitable stare of some kind of beautiful

1690
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:54,400
you just could away, oh your friends think you're satisfied, but they can't see us so, no, no, no,

1691
01:47:54,720 --> 01:48:10,400
forgot the time feeling better to find, when they live alone, if you can't wake up in the morning,

1692
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:22,400
because you're made last week in the night, if you're lost, you're trying to lonely,

1693
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:40,400
and controlling, try as you might, be your father, love your own baby, may I find it that the end of the day, you won't be lost,

1694
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:56,400
try as you might, be your father, love your own baby, may I find it that the end of the day, you'll be fresh to cast the unsuitable stare of some kind of

1695
01:48:56,400 --> 01:49:20,400
beautiful, you won't come your way, oh your friends think you're satisfied, but they can't see us so, no, no, no, no,

1696
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:36,400
forgot the time feeling better to find, when they live alone, if you can't wake up in the morning,

1697
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:48,400
because you're made last week in the night, if you're lost, you're trying to lonely,

1698
01:49:48,400 --> 01:50:04,400
controlling, try as you might, be your father, love your own baby, may I find it that the end of the day,

1699
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:25,400
you won't be lost, try as you might, be your father, love your own baby,

1700
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:38,400
certainly the most personal song I've played on source code 798 for you, it was a time in 2002 when I had a business venture go wrong and it wasn't about that,

1701
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:45,400
but I had known my partner for many, many years and he turned out to be complete fraud, so I know what it's like to be,

1702
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:53,400
you know, you know, you're doing it, literally with a rule pulled over my eyes, guys name wasn't even legally the name that he used,

1703
01:50:53,400 --> 01:51:02,400
and it hurt a lot of people who were working on stuff, it wasn't about the money, but it was about what we really thought was right and we're doing together,

1704
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:09,400
and it was this song that pulled me out of a week of real, I mean I went off to another house that we had and I, you know,

1705
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:15,400
stayed in bed for days and then this song is corny as it may sounds really, really helped me through that,

1706
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:25,400
so I suggest you go buy that at iTunes or wherever you might purchase your music and play that when you're feeling lost hurt,

1707
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:27,400
and if you're lonely.

1708
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:36,400
Okay, wow, final song for the Charlie for today, and this is something that is actually it's another Sinatra song,

1709
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:40,400
I was going through my Sinatra library and man, this guy had some songs.

1710
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:44,400
Back in the day when you could actually understand the lyrics and they were kind of spelled out really plainly,

1711
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:49,400
I want you to, if you can, if you're driving, please don't, but you might be listening to this on an airplane,

1712
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:54,400
for the holiday weekend, or you might be chilling around the house.

1713
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:58,400
I just listen to this on the speakers, I'd like you to close your eyes for a second,

1714
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:08,400
and if you're not an American, I hope you will be able to visualize because these are the ideals and the thoughts that I grew up with.

1715
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:13,400
Of course, this song being recorded probably just a little bit before I was born, I heard a lot around the house,

1716
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:19,400
and this really was the reality that I believed in for so long until that bubble was absolutely popped,

1717
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:25,400
but in essence, it really is the truth, so close your eyes for a second.

1718
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:33,400
You are American, I want you to take a trip down with me to the place that is America,

1719
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:45,400
to the people we are, and the values and ideals that we stand for, as sung by Newark's favorite song, Sinatra.

1720
01:52:45,400 --> 01:53:11,400
What is America, to me, a man, or a flag I see, a certain word, democracy, what is America, to me.

1721
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:30,400
The house I live in, a plough of earth, a street, a grocer, and the butcher, and the people that I meet,

1722
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:42,400
the children in the playground, the faces that I see, all races and religions,

1723
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:58,400
that's America to me, the place I work in, the work of my son, the little town or city,

1724
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:10,400
where my people live and die, the howdy and the handshake, the air of feeling free,

1725
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:25,400
and the ride to speak my mind out, that's America to me, the things I see about me, the big things in the small,

1726
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:39,400
the little corner new stand, and the house of my old home, the wedding and the church, the laughter and the tears,

1727
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:54,400
the dream that's been a crime, more hundred and fifty years, the town I live in,

1728
01:54:54,400 --> 01:55:10,400
the street, the house, the pavement of the city, for a garden all in bloom, the church, the school,

1729
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:31,400
the house, the million lights I see, what is the story of people, that's America to me.

1730
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:40,400
That's what it was before printing and playing in the bombs, it's all above the people, and the people worldwide.

1731
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:45,400
All right, chuckle heads, with that I wrap it up, I'm sure I'll be talking to you tomorrow.

1732
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:50,400
I know a gender with John C. Devore Act, but I am happy that we had this time together.

1733
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:57,400
It's almost just after three o'clock, so I believe actually I get to see the demonstration of the blue angels flying by the condo,

1734
01:55:57,400 --> 01:56:08,400
maybe it's tomorrow, I don't know. So, summing it all up, I would say, please utilize what freedom you have left,

1735
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:13,400
mobilize and above all, live your life with passion.

1736
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:17,400
Another fine, medium presentation, stick it in your ear.
