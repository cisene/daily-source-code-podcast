I can't see you, Stephen Tyler, didn't put up with crap like this.

152
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,600
It's not a making up for what I missed.

153
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,600
I got a body like a rock star, hit a bunch of strip bars, wake up, naked in a hotel room.

154
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,600
So my TV at the window, scored a bunch of endo, hit a thing to get, my mind, I'll be you.

155
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,600
By the telephone, pull the ramp around my car.

156
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600

157
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Oh, damn, oh, come on.

158
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,600
And the more I think about it, the less it hurts you side.

159
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,600

172
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,600
I linked all of the songplay out on the daily source code, of course,

173
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,000
In the show notes for each episode at dailysourceco.com, today is a phenomenally beautiful

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
day.

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,560
In fact, I'm so happy I chose today as my big production day, or I'm going to sit inside

176
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,880
and just look out at the blue sky, I'm not a cloud at all.

177
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,280
I see some contrails, they portrayals from the planes, we see that would be a gattwick.

178
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,840
I just had to position myself, it was a gattwick or a Heathrow.

179
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,560
It is a whole man, it's just these are the days that you got to live for.

180
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,800
But it being Fubar Friday, we have a show stacked up with all kinds of stuff.

181
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,920
And in fact, I want to just kind of stick with the UK for the first part of today's Fubar

182
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Friday.

183
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,000
First of all, a little correction was to always appreciate being corrected on language,

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,840
use of, and or pronunciation.

185
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,100
Hey, Adam Man, again, one more thing that I just picked up on this into the rest of the

186
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
shape.

187
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,200
And I've been wanting to say to ages, but I just forgot I guess, it's not only in the

188
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,720
UK, you have no idea how much it's squealing.

189
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
I don't know.

190
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:48,520
Anyway, this is what it's about, not only in the UK, but in the UK, and for the listeners

191
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,520
in the States, and actually all countries around the world, I think it'd be very interested

192
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,000
with the situation here.

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,880
And I've started to make a little bit of a study of what is happening here.

194
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,120
And in the knowledge that Patricia and I, the lady Patricia and I always wanted to, I

195
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,400
mean, hey, she's the lady.

196
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,240
I mean, what do you expect?

197
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,120
We always wanted to live in the United Kingdom.

198
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,840
And we kind of said it as a long time ago when we were still living in Jersey, in New

199
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,960
Jersey, in the States.

200
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,760
And so we finally got here.

201
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,400
And although we didn't really have any expectations.

202
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,400
And if we did, certainly, the humor and sense of irony of the Brits has surpassed all

203
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
expectations.

204
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,480
You know, we're totally in love with the British people, with living here.

205
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,360
But there are some things that I've started to notice.

206
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,600
And I've made a bit of a study about the, I think it's almost a general apathy amongst

207
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
the population.

208
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,680
And there's a couple of calls I want to play for you, and then we'll kind of get into

209
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
it.

210
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,680
We just, well, let's listen to a little bit of anger.

211
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
It's always.

212
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,680
I don't think it's Mike here, sounding Western superman at the moment, Alias.

213
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
I don't know.

214
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
Yeah, Golden Brown.

215
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,680
He's a fucking tool.

216
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,680
He was, was a fucking tool.

217
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,680
He, when he was just a bloody, what needs in the prime minister?

218
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
I don't know.

219
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
No, I don't know.

220
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
Yeah.

221
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
No problem.

222
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
What's the door fucking echo?

223
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
I don't know.

224
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,680
I got, I got some reverb.

225
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,680
I know what you were hearing on the phone.

226
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,680
Yeah, so I have definitely changed my opinion.

227
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,680
I certainly was in the, I was hoping.

228
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Let's put it that way.

229
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,680
I was completely hopeful that Gordon Brown would, you know, despite his, you know, or regardless

230
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,680
of his background, his political achievements, et cetera, just the appearance of the man

231
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,680
being a patriarch of the people, kind of, you know, really leading the country.

232
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
I thought that you had that in them.

233
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,680
I think he has a lot of those qualities.

234
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,680
But I definitely have to reverse my opinion of the, of the prime minister of the United Kingdom.

235
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,680
Now that I've kind of seen what he's been doing.

236
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Of course, that goes into a number of things.

237
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,680
One is, without a doubt, the northern rock crisis, which he basically just took tax payers

238
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
money, 24 billion pounds.

239
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,680
So that's about 50 billion dollars worth to save shareholders.

240
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,680
Or at least a temporarily safe shareholders from demise.

241
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,680
And how many shareholders are there?

242
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,680
So this bank, like, like a thousand shareholders, which I just find to be a disgusting

243
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,680
practice.

244
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
And it's completely wrong.

245
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,680
And what I'm missing, and I'm going to build up to something here.

246
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,680
I'm really missing the outrage amongst the populace here.

247
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,680
You know, how, how can people stand for this shit?

248
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,680
I add a mech agent take here from London, not too far away from you.

249
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,680
Just a couple of things about the northern rock.

250
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,680
And the fact that there hasn't been up and up for all here, as you mentioned.

251
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,680
And I think the reason for that is because people perceive that as being the government

252
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,680
doing the right thing, maybe this time.

253
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,680
It's not, it's not about the saving of bank.

254
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,680
It's about the saving that under the thousands or perhaps millions of people who've got

255
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,680
money tied up in there and threw no port of their own.

256
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,680
Just come to choose the wrong bank, perhaps.

257
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,680
So I think the uproar would come if they didn't set in and do something.

258
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Me, I'm fortunate I ain't dangerously near 50 now.

259
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,680
I ride a brand new Honda CVR 600R.

260
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,680
And finally, I love you, I mean it.

261
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
And I've said it in the 80s.

262
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
And I'm still saying now, great year.

263
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Thanks, man.

264
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
I appreciate it.

265
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Well, there is a misconception here, because actually, the taxpayers are on the hook for over 50

266
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,680
billion pounds because there's an insurance part that, yes, the government is responsible

267
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,680
and does ensure deposits all deposits on all accredited banks.

268
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,680
I'm not quite sure what it's called here in the United States.

269
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,680
It's the FDIC, which means no matter what happens, your deposited money is always

270
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,680
insured and you'll always get that back.

271
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,680
So that insurance by itself is already 24 or 26 billion.

272
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,680
I don't know the exact number and I could be off by a billion.

273
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,680
But what's a billion amongst friends?

274
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,680
So the guarantee they placed is an addition to that.

275
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,680
So I hope your blood is starting to boil a little bit because, you know, they're not really

276
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
talking about this.

277
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,680
And of course, why would they?

278
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Because Adrian Pegg, who I know I've met and I know personally is a very smart guy.

279
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,680
Even he's gotten snowed over by this.

280
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Why is the dog barking in the middle of my rant?

281
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
Stop it.

282
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,680
So maybe that will start to create a little bit of outrage because it's just completely wrong.

283
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,680
And now, essentially, there's either an internal buyout, which will make several people

284
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
extremely wealthy.

285
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,680
That's the proposal from the current management of the bank.

286
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,680
And then there's of course, you know, the one party has withdrawn their offer or had

287
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
didn't even put an offer on the table.

288
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,680
They withdrew from the, from what's called a contest.

289
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,680
So Virgin money is still in there.

290
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,680
And what they're doing is they're going to bring in 250 million pounds.

291
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
And they're going to bring Virgin money.

292
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,680
The existing company into it, which they value at 250 million pounds.

293
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
You know, that, of course, remains to be seen.

294
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
I think they, you know, they're last quarter.

295
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
They reported maybe 30 million in profit.

296
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
So it's not like a huge operation.

297
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,680
So, okay.

298
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,680
So that could be half a billion.

299
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,680
And then they'll go get another half a billion.

300
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,680
And I'm telling you where it's coming from.

301
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,680
It's going to come from China, which is why Richard Branson was in China with Gordon Brown.

302
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,680
I mean, this is China has, has, has welcomed out in the United Kingdom.

303
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
I'm not condemning it.

304
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,680
I'm not condoning it.

305
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
I'm just saying.

306
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
I'm just saying.

307
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,680
So that's a big mess, okay.

308
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
And it's fucked up.

309
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,680
And I'm going to get to this, to this wire tapping thing in a second.

310
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
But first there's one other thing because, you know,

311
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,680
I'm building up here to how controlled the UK population really is.

312
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,680
There's taxes and payments for everything.

313
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,680
You want to take a shit.

314
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,680
You got to pay some kind of tax for it.

315
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,680
Now I'm not complaining because I choose to live here.

316
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,680
And I'll gladly pay the shit tax.

317
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,680
But there's stuff like the congestion charge we've spoken about before.

318
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
It's kind of getting weird.

319
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,680
I thought I'd send you a recording on my thoughts about the congestion charge.

320
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,680
I live outside London about the same distance as you.

321
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,680
Which is about the 20 pounds return ticket.

322
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
Yeah, that's right.

323
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,680
Actually, no, it is.

324
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
It's 20 pounds return from me.

325
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,680
And I take the train into the city every single day.

326
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,680
I usually will take a car service back so that I can use my phone.

327
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,680
Yeah, just not to be rude to people and also just for the connectivity.

328
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,680
But on the way in, it's always on the train.

329
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,680
And if you take a regular ticket, it's about 10 pounds.

330
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,680
It's about 20 pounds one way for a first class.

331
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,680
Which I have to admit I sometimes indulge in that.

332
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,680
On the train into the big city.

333
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Now, what I'll do is I'll look at a very basic costing of how much

334
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,680
it's going to take to get into Central London.

335
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,680
If I look at the congestion charge, which is 8 pounds,

336
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,680
parking in Central London, which is generally about 10 pounds,

337
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,680
then already on my own.

338
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,680
It's cost more than the price of a rail fare.

339
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
So rather than drive it.

340
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,680
One car, 3 empty seats into Central London, I'll take the train.

341
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,680
Yeah, don't please don't forget the actual cost of driving.

342
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
You've got to add some money there.

343
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
I mean, your car doesn't run for free.

344
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,680
In fact, what is petrol here now?

345
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,680
If I were to translate it into US prices,

346
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
probably about $809 a gallon.

347
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,680
And just cramming like a sardine with everybody else.

348
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,680
But just for the sake of a single journey with just me,

349
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
it's the most efficient way of doing it.

350
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,680
And it's the cheapest way.

351
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,680
Now, if I'm taking the family or if I'm taking more than one person,

352
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,680
it's starting to become more financially viable,

353
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,680
to actually have four people in the car.

354
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,680
And each of us paying their own share.

355
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,680
Obviously, for parking for the congestion charge and everything.

356
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,680
So the way I look at it is if the congestion charge stops just one person like me

357
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:05,680
from taking a full, sorry, from taking an empty large vehicle,

358
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,680
into central London for no reason, other than vanity really.

359
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,680
And yes, I would prefer to listen to my iPod.

360
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,680
I would prefer to have my own heating control.

361
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,680
I'd prefer not to have stinky armpits of the person next to me.

362
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,680
And this is exactly my point.

363
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,680
I was hoping you wouldn't get to this point.

364
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,680
And indeed, you got to it.

365
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Of course, look, I take the train because,

366
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,680
well, exactly all of those issues you mentioned.

367
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,680
I mean, you've got to deal with traffic.

368
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,680
You've got the congestion charge.

369
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,680
You've got parking to deal with.

370
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,680
And by the way, it seems like since the congestion.

371
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,680
Why call it a congestion charge if you, or,

372
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,680
I mean, the intent, of course, was to bring congestion down.

373
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,680
All it's done is bring congestion up.

374
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,680
And I'm in the city often enough to be able to evaluate that.

375
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,680
So somehow the system didn't really work.

376
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,680
So yeah, taking the train is a great idea.

377
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,680
If you have to start at 9 o'clock in the morning.

378
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,680
And honestly, I never take a train any earlier than 10.

379
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,680
For this very reason, even if you buy a first-class ticket,

380
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,680
you'll be caught standing up because they don't have enough trains.

381
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,680
The trains, well, I have to say that the Southwest train service

382
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,680
to Guilford is, I'd have to say, quite good.

383
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,680
But that is more the exception than the rule.

384
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,680
And there's a lot of complaints about just not enough capacity.

385
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:35,680
There's all kinds of issue with rail neds who take care of the actual rail rail infrastructure.

386
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
It's shit.

387
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
And you ask anyone here.

388
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,680
And I'm surprised because Southwest must be, as I said,

389
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,680
really the exception because what people complain so much.

390
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,680
And this is really what I'm amazed at.

391
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,680
Where is the protest here in the UK?

392
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Where is the outrage my British friends?

393
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,680
It appears to me that some of the great British spirit,

394
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,680
perhaps was broken in, I guess that would be the 70s.

395
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,680
When Margaret Thatcher really broke the unions, broke the coal miners unions,

396
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
I have a feeling she broke a lot of the spirit.

397
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:17,680
And then, of course, 10 years ago, everyone here was promised that the new labor.

398
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
In fact, there was a song.

399
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,680
I think it was to, to sunny and shares.

400
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,680
You got you babe, you know, the new labor and everything's going to be different.

401
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,680
Everything's going to be better.

402
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
It can't get any worse.

403
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,680
And of course, everyone feels that it got a hell of a lot worse.

404
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,680
And now we're in the middle of this credit crisis, which, by the way, my British friends,

405
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,680
you were fucked on that, okay?

406
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
Here's what happened.

407
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Here's what new, here's what new labor did for you.

408
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,680
So let's just say Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

409
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,680
If he was the chancellor of the ex-checker.

410
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,680
I love that word.

411
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,680
Ex-checker.

412
00:19:51,680 --> 00:20:00,680
So these guys were responsible through the Bank of England for lowering interest rates.

413
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:06,680
It really consistently lowering them, keeping them very low, keeping those interest rates suppressed,

414
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,680
so that everyone would go out and spend money.

415
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
And boy, did you guys?

416
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,680
You spent it on houses, you got massive loans, all kinds of credit cards, and other kinds of debt.

417
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,680
And you bought all kinds of beautiful shit.

418
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,680
There was a show on Panorama last night, where Panorama's episode last night was about this very

419
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:30,680
topic called, it was the night before, repossession, repossession, repossession, a fun play on the relocation,

420
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,680
relocation, relocation.

421
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
The party is just over.

422
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,680
And now people are stuck with huge debts that they are unable to pay off.

423
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,680
I mean, it is exactly the same thing that happened in America.

424
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,680
Only in America, we're used to this.

425
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
This is how the system has worked for years.

426
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,680
And of course, it had to come to an end at some point, and I think we're coming to the end in the US.

427
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,680
But over here, I'm telling you, you are systematically fucked by your government.

428
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
Okay?

429
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
They made you get credit.

430
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
They made you spend all this.

431
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,680
We all had a great big party.

432
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,680
This is the most expensive country in the world to live in almost.

433
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,680
And we're now, now here we are.

434
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
We're screwed.

435
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
And what is the government doing?

436
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,680
They're bailing out the fucking bank for Christ's sake.

437
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
The bank, not the people.

438
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,680
They're taking your money and bailing out commercial entities.

439
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,680
That's wrong.

440
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,680
You know, sometimes I wonder if this, you know, the inherent on the hatreds of big word,

441
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,680
we're kind of despisal of the French by their British.

442
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,680
If it's not based on a little bit of jealousy, because you guys may have your fundamental differences.

443
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,680
But one thing you just have to admit, when the French don't like something the government are doing,

444
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,680
they get up in arms, and they don't just go on strike, they go to the streets.

445
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,680
And they let their government know, they say, hey, you know, dudes, you know, we're going to burn this shit down

446
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,680
if you don't change the way.

447
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
What are you going to raise taxes on gas?

448
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
I don't think so.

449
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
We're going to riot.

450
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,680
And you don't see that anymore.

451
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Are you not, is it allowed by law?

452
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
Are you allowed to go out and protest?

453
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
I don't see anyone protest ever.

454
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:08,680
And now, now what's coming to light on top of us learning that private information,

455
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,680
is dealt with in a very cavalier manner here in the United Kingdom.

456
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,680
It's putting, put on burnt on to unsecured CDs and DVDs.

457
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,680
It sent through the unsecured mail.

458
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,680
It's getting left on laptops that are getting stolen.

459
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,680
Yeah, just all kinds of disregard for our private information.

460
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Now, a conversation that started about the wire tapping or bugging of ministers of parliament,

461
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,680
has spread, and now what's coming to light is we're learning that in the United Kingdom,

462
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:51,680
there are 800, eight, I'm going to repeat that 800 organizations that have the right to wire tap you,

463
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,680
including the Department of Agriculture.

464
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:01,680
And the only level of seniority that you need to have,

465
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,680
it's like a senior manager can request without calling an intercept.

466
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,680
Well, let's just call it what it is Gordon Brown.

467
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
It's not an intercept.

468
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
It's a wire tap.

469
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,680
This is the surveillance state.

470
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,680
It is the snoop dog nation of the world.

471
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,680
The British people, and I'm just going to include myself in that,

472
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,680
are being watched everywhere 24 hours a day.

473
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,680
And the freaking Department of Agriculture, if they're pissed off about your law, I guess,

474
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
can request a wire tap.

475
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,680
They can have your internet connection bug, so they can look at all the websites that you're visiting.

476
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,680
They can request all of your, all phone calls that you're making.

477
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,680
That you cannot deny that this has got to be pressuring you.

478
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,680
You've got to be a little bit freaked out about this.

479
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,680
This is just, it's wrong.

480
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
And there just seems to be a general apathy about it.

481
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,680
No one's really saying anything.

482
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,680
And I was talking to a cab driver, the other.

483
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,680
I love talking to cab drivers, man.

484
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,680
They would give you a real sense of the street.

485
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,680
And he was saying that, and this is, I thought this was very interesting.

486
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,680
He said, we have no voice in Britain.

487
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,680
We have nowhere to go and complain.

488
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,680
And of course, then I start asking about protests.

489
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,680
And he says, no, I don't think we really do that.

490
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,680
You know, we keep it all inside.

491
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,680
Which, of course, I lead to the logical conclusion of why we're drinking smoking and eating

492
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,680
ourselves to death in this country is because we're unhappy.

493
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,680
You've got to let that out.

494
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:38,680
Now, I know that, you know, so maybe it's not within the British culture to go out and demonstrate and protest.

495
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,680
But it's getting time, my friends.

496
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
And I really want to hear from you about this.

497
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
Okay.

498
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,680
I really want you to call in and give me your thoughts.

499
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,680
And I think you need to take it to the streets.

500
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
And we could do it in a civilized manner.

501
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,680
Or, you know, maybe we do some flash mobs.

502
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,680
I'd be happy to coordinate that and participate in some, you know, massive flash mobs, which is a form of protest.

503
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,680
It doesn't have to be non-violent.

504
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,680
I think we have to scare them that we're much more organized than we are because clearly we're not.

505
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,680
And I will stand up in front because I'm living here.

506
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,680
And I got to tell you, this is, it's, it's mess up.

507
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:16,680
It is the Snoop Dogg State of the world, the surveillance state.

508
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,680
You have absolutely no privacy and they're taking your money left and right.

509
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,680
And this guy Gordon Brown, he's in charge of the whole deal.

510
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,680
And you've got to be really, really careful at this point.

511
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,680
And something else I've noticed.

512
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Where, where are the people we can look up to?

513
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,680
What's, what's my daughter?

514
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,680
Is my daughter supposed to understand what's going on now?

515
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,680
And she's just as apathetic as the rest.

516
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,680
She's 17 like all her friends, 17 and 20 years old.

517
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
Now, they don't see leaders.

518
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,680
They see guys who were trained as politicians.

519
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,680
You know?

520
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,680
Are there any teachers to look up to?

521
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
Please, be honest with me.

522
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,680
The public school system here in the United Kingdom is screwed.

523
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,680
My daughter went to, well, they call it private school here.

524
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,680
But, you know, basically, state school.

525
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,680
She went for three years.

526
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:10,680
It was atrocious, absolutely atrocious, created a complete class society.

527
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Where you can only really get a good education if you pay for it.

528
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Or if you go into massive debt, massive, I'm talking kids who graduate from university with

529
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,680
30 or 40,000 pounds worth of debt attached to their name.

530
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Oh, yeah, sure.

531
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,680
Sure.

532
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,680
It's, it's really easy terms to pay it off.

533
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,680
But 40,000 pounds, 80,000 dollars in debt.

534
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Where is you could probably wipe out all that debt with the bailout.

535
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,680
You handed over on a silver platter to these commercial bankers.

536
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:49,680
Ask yourself this, Britain, and really ask yourself whatever happened to your heroes.

537
00:26:49,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Whatever happened to you, Leon Trotsky, he got a nice pick.

538
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:20,680
That made us used by whatever happened to you.

539
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:30,680
Do you blend in to create a mirror and such a panzer.

540
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:36,680
Whatever happened to you, heroes.

541
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,680
Whatever happened to you, heroes.

542
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:48,680
Whatever happened to you, all the heroes.

543
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,680
Other Shakespeareaus.

544
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,680
They must have owned them.

545
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:01,680
Whatever happened to the heroes.

546
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Whatever happened to the heroes.

547
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:14,680
No more heroes anymore, no more heroes anymore.

548
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:44,680
Whatever happened to you, heroes.

549
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:52,680
Whatever happened to you, heroes.

550
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:58,680
Whatever happened to you, heroes.

551
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Whatever happened to you, all the heroes.

552
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Other Shakespeareaus.

553
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Whatever happened to you, all the heroes.

554
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,680
Other Shakespeareaus.

555
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:30,680
They must have owned them.

556
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:36,680
Whatever happened to you, heroes.

557
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:43,680
Whatever happened to you, heroes.

558
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:50,680
No more heroes anymore, no more heroes anymore.

559
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:56,680
No more heroes anymore, no more heroes anymore.

560
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
That's right.

561
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,680
The strangest new all about it.

562
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,680
Twenty-five or even twenty-six years ago.

563
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Whatever happened to you, all the heroes.

564
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,680
United Kingdom, I want to hear from you.

565
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Is it just footballers and their wags?

566
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
What is going on in this country?

567
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
Surely it can be better.

568
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,680
Let's not leave it full-barred forever.

569
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,680
You know Adam, I hope you play this.

570
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,680
This is important to me.

571
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,680
All the time you hear people saying, let me talk about the press of rules and technology and

572
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
spying and monitoring surveillance.

573
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680
Okay.

574
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,680
Well, if you're doing nothing wrong, what do you have to fear?

575
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,680
My reply to that is, if I'm doing nothing wrong, why do you have to look?

576
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,680
I'm calling casting with Adam Curry.

577
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,680
Hey Adam, are you ready to be stumps?

578
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,680
Hell yeah.

579
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Cause he is the princess.

580
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
Bring it on.

581
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
I'm ready for a full-barred.

582
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
It's just a number one-to-eight.

583
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,680
Okay.

584
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
And we're going to start right away with intro.

585
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
Number one.

586
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
Oh, come on.

587
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,680
Eight.

588
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
Salt my intelligence here.

589
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
I mean, that's easy.

590
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,680
That is, of course.

591
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,680
Kiss.

592
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,680
And I was made for love and you must have been late 70s.

593
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,680
Number two.

594
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,680
Uh.

595
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,680
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh it's Paul Kirk.

596
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Uh I want you, I love, uh uh uh.

597
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,680
Hang up, something.

598
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,680
Oh, man.

599
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,680
Uh okay.

600
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
You got me.

601
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
I have no clue what that is.

602
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,120
And time's up.

603
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,280
Yeah, oh yeah.

604
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,640
And these are the answers.

605
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,080
From 1979.

606
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,920
There's this answer number one.

607
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,120
This is Kiss.

608
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,560
Tonight.

609
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,360
I don't get it all to you.

610
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,760
I don't get it all to you.

611
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,440
I was back without the new baby.

612
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,960
You were back with love at me.

613
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,960
And I can't get it all from you.

614
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,960
I was made for love when you kissed this answer number one.

615
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,040
I tell you this is answer number two from 1983.

616
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,280
How is the title like?

617
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:27,680
I don't need a approval from a chosen few.

618
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Tell me what I do need.

619
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,960
I need you.

620
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
That's it.

621
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Told you.

622
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,960
I need you.

623
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,120
Answer number two is fall character.

624
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
And I need you.

625
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,200
I got a point for that.

626
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,840
And this is answer number three.

627
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
That hell is this.

628
00:32:44,840 --> 00:33:09,820
One new y Release A ho!

629
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,060
A releasing number three.

630
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,060
The rap!

631
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,500
Why are you my baby?

632
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,340
You might be bad.

633
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,700
You got me on number one.

634
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,540
Oh, eight.

635
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,540
And that's it for this week.

636
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,740
How did you do Adam?

637
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,580
I think I got two out of three, honestly.

638
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,140
The answer is hit test and also the links to iTunes

646

652
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,580
Oi, Adam.

653
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,460
Yeah, you miss Adam, Terry.

654
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,300
It's Chris Lane here.

655
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,140
I've got a bone to pick with you.

656
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,860
Every single time you do a bloody food bar Friday,

657
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,460
I end up going to the iTunes store,

658
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,140
giving out my wallet and finding my credit card.

659
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,940
You are billing me, roughly,

660
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,020
about size pounds a month.

661
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,180
This isn't good.

662
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,780
I do not like spending money,

663
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,460
especially when I'm buying money on songs.

664
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,260
I really, really, really, really, really like something

665
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,500
to put the artist on you.

666
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,180
Just so I'd like you know that.

667
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,540
Of course, not really that best off of it.

668
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,940
Keep up the good work.

669
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,900
Where did now love you?

670
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,500
Meen it.

671
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Love you.

672
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,420
No home, no meme it.

673
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,500
Have you win?

674
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,140
Great hair.

675
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,220
Something wrong around about possibly

676
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,700
you're going to think cock too.

677
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Not really, you mean or nail 18 middle class university.

678
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,940
All right, that's it.

679
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,460
Anyway, I'd like to, all right.

680
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,260
Let me tell you, man, this is the only show

681
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,100
this free that's still cost you money.

682
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,140
I don't got a win.

683
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:54,300
Take the sauce code.

684
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,100
I don't got a win.

685
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,300
I got a kicker, he's sauce.

686
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,860
I don't got a win.

687
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,380

You've become the star of me, yeah.

707
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:54,620
Cities are superstar, yeah.

708
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:59,780
I don't care what she says.

709
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,820
They no love when you're born.

710
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,060
Like I can't give them a littlestock.

711
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:14,060
I get to my bed, she won't unlock the door

712
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:29,060
This time I got to unlock the door

713
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,060
It ain't too late to start yet

714
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:40,060
She won't be the right of the world

715
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:10,060
She won't be the right of the world

716
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:39,060
She won't be the right of the world

717
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:43,060
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

718
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:49,060
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

719
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,060
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

720
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:13,060
This pain I've got to let it get to go

721
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:18,060
It ain't too much to stop it

722
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:23,060
Which is genuinely a juggler

723
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:27,060
I don't want my soul to feel

724
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,060
She wants to feel it

725
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:37,060
I don't want my soul to feel it

726
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,060
Yeah, I love it

727
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,060
Curricing of surgery time

728
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,060
He knows how to bring it on

729
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,060
From pot safe music network, Big Head Todd

730
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,060
Has nothing to do with surgery

731
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,060
But it is the the

732
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,060
The whole second we pull it up here

733
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,060
There we go

734
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,060
Big Head Todd and the monsters

735
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,060
Her own kind of woman

736
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,060
On football Friday episode 720 of the daily source code

737
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,060
Got some fun TSA stuff for you

738
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,060
Not just transport security administration

739
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,060
But also the Homeland Security

740
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,060
Department

741
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,060
What is a DHS Department of Homeland Security

742
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,060
In general, first of all

743
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,060
And I told you that this was the entertainment of the week for me

744
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,060
And it's just kept on going

745
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,060
On the TSA weblog

746
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,060
And you can probably just google this one

747
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,060
It's all over the net

748
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,060
The TSA posted a note

749
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,060
Apparently a lot of people recently at San Francisco

750
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,060
Myself not included I have to say

751
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,060
When passing through TSA security

752
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,060
Checkpoint Charlie

753
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,060
We're requested to pull out all electronic gadgets

754
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,060
Not just their laptops

755
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:47,060
But blackberries, crackberries, nukyophones, cables

756
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,060
You know everything

757
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,060
And the question was of course

758
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,060
Is this standard practice

759
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,060
Or is this something that's only happening at SFO

760
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,060
And they responded with

761
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,060
You know just a really infantile response

762
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,060
It's almost comical at this point

763
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,060
It's almost like someone is trying to be so hip

764
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,060
They're trying to write in bloggo speak

765
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,060
And they in fact they even talk about the blogger sphere

766
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,060
With an E

767
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,060
That's what they wrote on there

768
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,060
That comments

769
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,060
And they said well the bloggers win it

770
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,060
You're right

771
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,060
This was not sanctioned

772
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,060
And they shouldn't have been doing that

773
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,060
So you've changed something already

774
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,060
Which of course a lot of people are scoffing

775
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,060
But bottom line is

776
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,060
Dude we changed something

777
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,060
We actually

778
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,060
We actually achieved something

779
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,060
You know so let's not go over this too lightly

780
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:38,060
Let's not make too much of a comedy caper out of it

781
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,060
Because even though the language is infantile

782
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,060
And it's all extremely lame

783
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,060
We called them on something

784
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,060
And they responded

785
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,060
So I think we should keep going with this

786
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,060
I'm rather excited

787
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,060
On the other hand

788
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,060
I'm very frightened

789
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,060
Are you going to love this one

790
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,060
This came in from

791
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,060
David Johnson sent this to me

792
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,060
Actually sent it to myself and to

793
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,060
John C. Dvorak

794
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:08,060
And I can't wait to talk about this on the next no agenda

795
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,060
I have to do it now

796
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,060
This is kind of interesting

797
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,060
So we sent a link to a market watch

798
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,060
Press release

799
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,060
Which is pretty much

800
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,060
It comes off of PR news wires

801
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,060
So it's put up by the company itself

802
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,060
And this is a release from

803
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,060
Virtress systems

804
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,060
Let's see

805
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,060
Major General Perry

806
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,060
No, I'm sorry

807
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,060
Major General Perry

808
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,060
V. Dolby

809
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,060
USA retired

810
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,060
Virtress systems chief executive officer

811
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,060
I guess he has some connection to the military industrial complex

812
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,060
Today announced the delivery of the first ten

813
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,060
Small arms training simulators

814
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,060
Of a 24 system order

815
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,060
From the Department of Homeland Security

816
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,060
So nothing really crazy about this

817
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,060
You know these are it's rather interesting

818
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,060
It's a virtual small arms training

819
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,060
Simulators

820
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,060
So basically teaching

821
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,060
Some agents or some department

822
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,060
How do you small firearms in a simulated environment

823
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,060
But here it comes

824
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:09,060
The ten small arms training simulators delivered

825
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,060
Our part of a larger 24 system sale

826
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,060
Two the transportation security

827
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,060
Administration

828
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,060
Totally nearly one million dollars

829
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:24,060
So you know I asked the question just a couple of shows ago

830
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:28,060
I said what is the only difference the only visible difference between

831
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,060
The TSA and the CBP

832
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,060
The Customs and Border Protection Agency

833
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,060
Who you will both encounter

834
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:38,060
Upon international arrival into the United States

835
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,060
Or actually upon departure

836
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:44,060
Well the the only difference is the TSA guys the people who are the security checkpoints

837
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,060
They're unarmed

838
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,060
They have no weapons quite honestly

839
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,060
I wouldn't trust any one of these baboons

840
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,060
With a weapon

841
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,060
And low and behold

842
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,060
It looks like the TSA

843
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,060
Is going to be receiving small arms training in simulated environments

844
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,060
Of course the simulated environments would include

845
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:06,060
People at checkpoints getting an art on airplanes

846
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,060
So this is a warning

847
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,060
It looks like they're going to be arming the TSA

848
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,060
Now something I'm very happy about Brian Noisent me this

849
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:22,060
The EFF as you know no love lost or won between myself and the EFF

850
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,060
I find it to be somewhat elite organization

851
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,060
But they're doing something very

852
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,060
Interesting to me

853
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,060
They are suing the Homeland Security

854
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,060
Administration

855
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,060
Under the Freedom of Information Act

856
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,060
Because they did not

857
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,060
Oops, sorry about that

858
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,060
Because they did not respond in a timely fashion

859
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,060
Two questions about the lookout list of CBP of the

860
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,060
Customs and Border Protection Agency

861
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,060
And this is it's a fantastic read

862
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,060
I'm going to put a link in the show notes to the article

863
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:56,060
As well as to they have a PDF file which is of the

864
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,060
Of the actual complaint that they're filing

865
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,060
So they really had no other choice

866
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,060
You know they asked all the right questions

867
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,060
Of the EFF they did a full blown freedom of information

868
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,060
Act

869
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,060
Excuse me

870
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,060
Freedom of Information act

871
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,060
Which of course these bone heads screwed up

872
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:16,060
And didn't get back to them in a timely fashion

873
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,060
So then there's grounds for lawsuit

874
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,060
Actually that's the only other thing you can do next

875
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,060
Except you know except nothing

876
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,060
But the questions in here it's all about

877
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,060
The searches, the secondary searches

878
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,060
Why people can't get off the list

879
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,060
Why

880
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,060
My copies are made of business cards

881
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,060
That's exactly what happened to me

882
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,060
You know why cell phone numbers are taken back

883
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,060
This is something really weird

884
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,060
I apologize I'm not quite sure what's going on

885
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,060
With the setup here

886
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,060
Let's just hope it hangs together

887
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,060
Um

888
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,060
Laptop computers

889
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,060
They read email

890
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,060
I mean they really go through even though I do understand

891
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,060
There are still some fourth amendment

892
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,060
Rights that do

893
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,060
That are valid during this type of search

894
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,060
Essentially they do have the right to search

895
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:08,060
But you know there's lots of really good questions here

896
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,060
And I'm very excited about it

897
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,060
Have a read through it. It's a pretty big document

898
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,060
It's about what's at 20 pages or so

899
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:18,060
Um and I could not be happier that this is taking place

900
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,060
Because we really need to understand

901
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,060
What's going on here

902
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,060
Particularly if now that the Department of Homeland

903
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,060
Homeland Security is also going to start arming the

904
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,060
Other end

905
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,060
We've got some stuff to talk about

906
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,060
We have the right to know some of this shit

907
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,060
So anyway

908
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,060
Interesting stuff happening with the

909
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:40,060
With the Homeland Security Department

910
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,060
And of course I'll keep you up the speed and up the tabs

911
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:46,060
Let us imagine that there's a podcaster out there

912
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,060
Who's driving passion is the automobile

913
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,060
Sorry about the weak pun

914
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,060
Anyway, he or she is

915
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:56,060
Car crazy and has informative or entertaining

916
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:00,060
Or just off the wall stuff to say about cars and motoring

917
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,060
To share with pod show listeners

918
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,060
Maybe his or her daily show includes music

919
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:08,060
On safe tracks for the road to nowhere

920
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,060
Or maybe the dark desert highway

921
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,060
If your show is like this

922
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:18,060
I'd like to link to it on one of the leading automotive themed blogs in Germany

923
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,060
In Germany

924
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,060
In Germany

925
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,060
Well there'll be links to shows in English

926
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,060
Which shows Adam well knows is understood by many in Germany

927
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:32,060
But podcasters whose shows are in German

928
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:36,060
Well, maybe they can get a step closer to quitting their day job

929
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:40,060
Meldoich podcasting out to not an outside shunt

930
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,060

You can try this cowbell out

940
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,060
Let's all give a nod

941
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:08,060
To the hardest work in law here

942
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,060
It's Jersey time

943
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,060

00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:24,060
He might even win this case

949
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,060
Jersey time

950
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,060

A little departure there for Sir Jersey tide

On the football tip on the Chilean

977
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,060
Welcome to my city where we don't play

I love our hood and everything around it

00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,060
And then we say he does yet still love on this

984
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,060
Back then they came on me now

00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,060

It is what it is and you want to run me down

1056
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:50,060
In the dirt, five, five, but for a night

1057
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,340
But I ain't worth a night

1058
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,380
I'll black just see you

1059
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,780
And I'll put it outside, L.A. City

1060
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,300
No, for low, low, to death

1061
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,420
They call me the money

1062
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,620
Cause they're your big girl

1063
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,060
When you come to my town

1064
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,420
You better act right

1065
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,020
Just be on the knee on the knees

1066
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:03,900
Come out at night

1067
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,820
Puss it too, Tesla, and you look good

1068
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,740
It got, watch what you step in

1069
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,020
Stay up on the white block

1070
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,220
This is my city

1071
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,420
This is my hood

1072
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,020
This is my box of bitch

1073
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,740
What's good?

1074
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,580
Westside, eastside, north-town

1075
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,380
But without a bitch

1076
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,140
You grow ladies and roll here

1077
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:18,940
Show me love

1078
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,780
My city, my hood, my street

1079
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,620
My block, my life, my world

1080
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,180
These bitch, I rock, so I've missed in the air

1081
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,780
But this city is high

1082
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,860
Wrap your hood, cause the hood don't stop

1083
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,780
My city, my hood, my street

1084
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,620
My block, my life, my world

1085
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,180
These bitch, I rock, so I've missed in the air

1086
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,780
But this city is high

1087
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:49,660
Wrap your hood, cause the hood don't stop

1088
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:52,220
You know, we don't talk about it a lot on the show

1089
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,900
But every single time

1090
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,020
I release a show, there's always comments coming in

1091
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,020
About the music

1092
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,820
And, you know, usually I don't talk about it

1093
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,660
Just because, you know, we all enjoy the music

1094
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:07,900
But this whole idea of the organization for the preservation of the soundtrack of our lives

1095
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,100
The hood don't stop

1096
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,580
Better known as up-soul is really catching on

1097
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,620
And really a lot of these tunes, a lot of these songs that we play with

1098
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,420
They're new or old, they all contribute to the soundtrack of our lives

1099
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,100
And of course, also on today's schedule

1100
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,700
It's to cut a couple new ones

1101
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,900
You can find it up-soul, OPSOL

1102
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,460
.podshow.com, so we'll have a new show out

1103
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,660
Today, I'm going to cut a couple of them

1104
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,780
So I have a template set up and I have enough in now to really start some production

1105
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,980
After I do pod finders and all kinds of stuff that I get to get done

1106
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,740
But this, this comment came in was just kind of freaky

1107
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,340
Hey, Adam, I'm Tim going for Morion

1108
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,340
It's interesting to play tell-coat today

1109
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,620
That I'll call mash up

1110
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,700
It was a fan of a couple of realms back in the day

1111
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,180
I'm so out of curiosity, I have to say I looked up some info on him

1112
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,700
Interesting, we had discovered that you played the sort of name of dates

1113
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,140
Mashup 10 years after Falcon's death to the day

1114
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,980
Poor second information from all over the world

1115
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,980
We can be a pdf of course

1116
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:07,580
Apparently he died of severe injuries following his collision with a bus in the tube and it's a BCP

1117
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,620
Yeah, yeah, he's dead

1118
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,260
All right, that was freaky though, isn't it?

1119
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,940
But I played it 10 years

1120
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,060
The tenth anniversary of his death to the day

1121
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,260
That's kind of scary

1122
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,340
And I just kind of appeared, man

1123
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,140
I don't know

1124
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:24,780
This is a Dutch email that I got in which I'll kind of translate on the fly Adam and listening to the DSA

1125
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:27,340
DSE for a long time big fan of the Fubar Friday

1126
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:31,020
Reminds me of the old days of Korean vendingual that you used to do in Holland on Fridays

1127
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,980
You played WOLD last time Harry Chaper and I got a little kind of melancholy

1128
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,860
And I was thinking you know could you do me a favor and

1129
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,060
Well, could you play another typical

1130
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,940
Track from the soundtrack of my life which is really he says a really lame track

1131
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,860
But it would be so awesome just to hear it again

1132
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:53,340
He's the track he's asking for is every shala la la

1133
00:53:54,140 --> 00:54:00,780
From the carpenters that is not actually the title and I did some searching around and I found what I think will be a perfect

1134
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,020
New entry to the soundtrack of your life

1135
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:08,540
You don't I'd suit for which is essentially a remix of the carpenters and of course

1136
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:14,060
It's about being young and listening to the radio and the shala la is in there and it's Fubar

1137
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:22,540
Oh my favorite song

1138
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:27,740
When they played I sing a song

1139
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:31,100
It made me smile

1140
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:40,380
Those were such happy times and that's a lot of love

1141
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:44,380
Now I wonder where they go

1142
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:51,260
But they're back again just like the long last friend

1143
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:56,380
All the song I love so well

1144
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,620
Every shala la la la

1145
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:05,660
Every woos no shala

1146
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,180
Black, black, black, black

1147
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,900
Every shala la la la

1148
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:17,660
And the start is just saying so far

1149
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,180
When they get to the port

1150
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,820
When he's breaking up

1151
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:32,700
They can really make me cry just like these

1152
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,700
Yeah, you're in the mirror, your dumb scream

1153
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,940
Please you're in flames

1154
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:42,600
more and more

1155
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,720
Dear

1156
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,800
Thank you so much for telling me

1157
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:54,400
Back on theOS mode is gone fire

1158
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:58,940
I am a differential that I have

1159
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,480
Makes me dizzy

1160
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:07,700
Don't much has changed

1161
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:17,700
If the song doesn't love that I would sing to them

1162
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:22,700
And I'd never rise each word

1163
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:28,700
Those old melodies still sounds so good to me

1164
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:33,700
As I know now, he's away

1165
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:38,700
Every song I know, every woe

1166
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,700
Still shine

1167
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,700
If the song doesn't love that I would sing to them

1168
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:50,700
If the song doesn't love that I would sing to them

1169
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,700
Still shine

1170
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:58,700
If the song doesn't love that I would sing to them

1171
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:02,700
All my best memories come back with it to me

1172
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,700
Some came and they came and they came

1173
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,700
Others like me

1174
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,700
Oh, you're so good, you're so good

1175
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,700
You're so good, you're so good

1176
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,700
It's yesterday

1177
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,700
One, two, three, you're so good

1178
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,700
Baby, baby, you're so good

1179
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,700
You're so good, you're so good

1180
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:24,700
Every song I know, every woe

1181
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:30,700
Still shine

1182
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:37,700
If the song doesn't love that I would sing to them

1183
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,700
Oh, that's beautiful, isn't it?

1184
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,700
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1185
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,700
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1186
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,700
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1187
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,700
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1188
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,700
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1189
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,700
Those of you listening to the DATA source code

1190
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,020
Whether you just started Who you've been around

1191
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,700
for a couple of years

1192
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,700
And episode 720, you believe it

1193
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,700
Hey, I got to help a brother in need here

1194
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:00,700
Check this out

1195
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,700
I'm Chris from Limitown

1196
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,700
Maybe you could help me out here

1197
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,700
if I'm not an opaque internet tablets

1198
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,700
Flash video does not work

1199
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,700
Oh

1200
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,700
Every single site I go to that uses flash

1201
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,700
Flash video like Ron Paul's website

1202
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,700
We'll help you to keep saying that

1203
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,700
You need the newer version of Flash

1204
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:20,700
to download there's no version available for the internet tablet.

1205
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,700
So, how is everybody doing financial videos?

1206
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,700
I am searched high and low on the mail site or on the KSI,

1207
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,700
and there's absolutely no reference whatsoever

1208
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,700
to people not being able to play Flash.

1209
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,700
I know I can't be unique in this regard.

1210
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,700
So, what's the deal here?

1211
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,700
How do I play Flash?

1212
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,700
A few weeks ago there was a month ago I was able to play Flash.

1213
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,700
And now I can't play Flash anymore.

1214
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,700
Everything's gonna need to update, update update.

1215
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,700
Well, we're not on you, get the update.

1216
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,700
Okay, okay, okay, hold on, hold on my brother, hold on.

1217
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,700
So, when you have phone and report like this,

1218
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,700
I've learned a long time ago.

1219
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:56,700
It's very handy if you can tell me about the environment you're working on

1220
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,700
and tell me what you did, what you expected to happen,

1221
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:00,700
and what really happened.

1222
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,700
Now, I got some data points in here.

1223
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,700
First of all, I don't know if you're on an N8010,

1224
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,700
or if you're on an N800.

1225
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:12,700
Second of all, I'm not quite sure if the Flash was working previously

1226
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,700
and now no longer works.

1227
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,700
I'm going to presume that it never worked for you,

1228
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,700
and that it's an N80010.

1229
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,700
The only thing I can imagine is that you have to get an update

1230
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,700
of the whole system software.

1231
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,700
If you go to the Nokia website and you'll see,

1232
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,700
you go to the N80010 page.

1233
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,700
You'll see a link right there is a special download

1234
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,700
or you have to download first.

1235
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,700
And I think they have a Mac version as well.

1236
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,700
I know it's certainly had to have a Windows version.

1237
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,700
And then that will keep track of your system.

1238
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,700
And make sure you have the latest release.

1239
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,700
Could you may just have an old release on there

1240
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,700
because you don't have to do anything.

1241
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,700
It should just work right out of the box.

1242
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,700
If you're getting, if it was working previously,

1243
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:55,700
now it's stopped working, you gotta let me know.

1244
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,700
But so please call in the reports like that.

1245
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,700
Now for those of you interested in this device,

1246
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,700
the N80010, you can go to curry.com.

1247
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,700
There's a link in the show notes.

1248
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,700
I've got a page there which tells you about it.

1249
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,700
I've got a couple more sites that are linked to it like

1250
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,700
and at hundredscreenshots.com.

1251
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:15,700
And you can get by using my special checkout code,

a 15% discount on buying this device.

1254
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,700
You cannot get a cheaper anywhere else.

1255
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:27,700
I know for sure because, oh, look, we cut the deal with Nokia.

1256
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,700
What the hell do you think I was doing in Finland?

1257
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,700
So please, I have a little check of that

1258
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,700
and get back to me on the flash problems.

1259
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:39,700
I'm sure we can work it out with our famous candy man, of course.

1260
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,700
One more for the podcast, I'm using Network Paul Malikon.

1261
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,700
Tell it to the bees.

1262
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:49,700
Someone's drank the hive and blacken.

1263
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:53,700
No one's sleeping well tonight.

1264
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:57,700
Now the banners has come.

1265
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:02,700
There's a thing that won't be seen.

1266
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,700
I'm sure there's a thing that won't be seen.

1298
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:39,120
.

1299
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,280
Why she used all I need to do to my eye.

1300
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:52,280
This is one street that I've been like and no one sleeping well tonight

1301
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:55,280
Now the burn is gone

1302
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:01,280
And you're from love, all the things we've been

1303
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:08,280
And now the last one, the dream that's held in the crowd

1304
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:21,280
I want, I want, I want, I want some air so

1305
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:37,280
John, it's Paul Melanchon but indeed you always want to say John Paul Melanchon

1306
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,280
Tell it to the bees, almost done with the football Friday

1307
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,280
One a little bit long as I see now, I apologize for that

1308
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,280
We just can't and a football Friday without you if you've talked

1309
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,280
Checkin' in though, can't we?

1310
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:54,280
No, Adam, I'm going to show you a little bit of a graphic thing

1311
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,280
I think I'm catching up a little bit, I'm a little behind

1312
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,280
The listening to last week's shows, I'll be done with a caught up

1313
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,280
by the end of today

1314
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,280
But I want to let you know, so here it goes

1315
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,280
I'm 38 first of all, so that's when we fallen in between

1316
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,280
In between 20 and 40 there

1317
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,280
Born in Israel raised in Los Angeles

1318
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:17,280
Now living in San Diego as you know

1319
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:22,280
I have a master's degree, some advanced education there

1320
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,280
I've been listening for a couple of years

1321
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:27,280
I've been listening to my mid 30

1322
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:32,280
And I've been inspired by you multiple times

1323
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:37,280
Towards, you know, taking baby steps towards doing my own podcast

1324
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:42,280
So I'm still hoping to get that off the ground, but definitely

1325
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:47,280
Into the whole podcast and culture

1326
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,280
And I'm sharing it with friends and love podcasts, music

1327
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,280
I barely listen to the broadcast radio anymore at all

1328
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:58,280
And I look forward to much, much more good time

1329
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,280
Listen to you and other producers

1330
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:05,280
And with continued good health, can you?

1331
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,280
Christina, Patricia, the rest of your family

1332
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,280
And we'll talk to you

1333
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,280
Thanks

1334
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,280
Come back to the world

1335
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,280
I got a survey that I want to talk about after this next song

1336
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,280
And I want you guys to fill out so that we can kind of shorten the comments

1337
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,280
So if you can get me rather long

1338
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,280
But first, cool y'all, and sunshine

1339
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,280
Imagine looking that life, the roads, didn't glass

1340
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,280
And the policy of the people's glass

1341
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,280
I've been on the way, we got that asses

1342
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,280
And all the homies got dubs and deets

1343
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,280
And when the poor boys pass, they wave and say hi

1344
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,280
And wear a grin

1345
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,280
And everybody that you meet is a potential friend

1346
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,280
And the women that you're right love you for yourself

1347
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,280
And not your lens

1348
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,280
And I pop and legs and heels for the plurries

1349
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,280
And to pretend, and they know we ought to say

1350
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,280
So no one hates you for the color of your skin

1351
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,280
And that be waiting for this one of the pieces

1352
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,280
Home near bliss that simple satisfaction

1353
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,280
Like I play the acting grits

1354
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,280
Since it's fully alive

1355
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,280
Like I'm filling up a first kiss

1356
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,280
And once you check out time, you got a smile on your lips

1357
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:20,280
And the whole world is like a neck door neighbor

1358
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,280
But to do your favor, you just don't be coming

1359
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,280
A million different flavors

1360
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,280
And I know it's got enough time to put it all in one run

1361
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,280
So I saved the flavors we take

1362
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,280
The feel for the ratings of the sunshine

1363
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:56,280
And love was a flower spread

1364
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,280
The petals about the planet

1365
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,280
And the plants eat throughout every city

1366
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,280
And country even adults, and I want me

1367
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,280
And try to make some sense in a situation that we call life some

1368
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,280
But we're illustration to help ease this strike some

1369
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:11,280
Liverpool penetration to try to make things right in

1370
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,280
Hope that what I'm saying

1371
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,280
And saturate your mind frame

1372
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,280
And help you put the pain and the pain at the everyday struggle

1373
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,280
I don't need it all, I want to see all your bubbles

1374
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,280
And rise to the top thing

1375
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,280
To be hard like a rock

1376
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,280
Because you know it's no sky

1377
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,280
And let's be let it all sky

1378
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,280
So when you face the face with adversity

1379
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,280
Disgrossing sea and looking in the eye

1380
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,280
And let it know that you can't hurt a G

1381
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,280
That you put in the risk of all of the things

1382
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,280
And people that you believe in

1383
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,280
So educate yourself alone to assess your achievements

1384
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,280
And imagine what's right

1385
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,280
So you can see it in your mind

1386
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,280
I guess it's better like sunshine

1387
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,280
Sitting in the sunshine

1388
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,280
And sunshine

1389
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,280
I don't know what's left

1390
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,280
Sunshine

1391
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:04,280
I don't know

1392
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,280
Walking in the sunshine

1393
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,280
And sunshine

1394
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,280
I don't know what's left

1395
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:14,280
Before I continue that mean make one thing clear

1396
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,280
It took me a while for the three things

1397
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,280
I learned the puppy for myself and career

1398
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,280
Got family in my fence

1399
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:22,280
I went to like a whole day

1400
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,280
Me like Moses brought the rent see and lead to the promised land

1401
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,280
I damn it's blazing

1402
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,280
And it feels amazing

1403
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,280
I can lay here till a moment

1404
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,280
Great and triple like a rain

1405
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:32,280
And throughout the years months and days

1406
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,280
Life is to pass by on the days

1407
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,280
And I was close to civicity

1408
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,280
Just waiting

1409
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,280
Living life for the eyes

1410
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,280
And nothing but close to your fans

1411
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,280
Catching hot maven

1412
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,280
It makes you to be a baller

1413
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:44,280
But the answer's all lanes

1414
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,280
But now I'm here and I promise to get my home

1415
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,280
So mind, body and spirit

1416
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,280
And try to lift every question

1417
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,280
My life is hell for all y'all can hear it

1418
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,280
It's just we remember the words from that

1419
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,280
Oh, we're positive to each other

1420
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,280
I'm living in the gates of paradise

1421
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,280
And I hope y'all remember to

1422
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,280
And even though it's where it's close

1423
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,280
Each side come to no mind

1424
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,280
It's okay because I don't mind

1425
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,280
If you share some of my sunshine

1426
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,280
I'm living in the sunshine

1427
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,280
And try to lift every question

1428
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,280
My life is hell for all y'all can hear it

1429
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:24,280
I'm living in the sunshine

1430
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,280
And I promise to get my home

1431
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,280
So mind, body and spirit

1432
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:48,780
Song was sent to me from Smithbrand.

1433
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:56,260
No real accompanying note other than the subject of the email, Song that fits you so well.

1434
01:09:56,260 --> 01:10:00,780
But of course, although not pod say, if I have to agree, I'm sitting in the sunshine,

1435
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:09,460
I don't mind sharing some of my sunshine with you, I ain't that the tree.

1436
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:15,340
Just a quick yonet survey, you know, in Google Docs now you can create an Excel spreadsheet

1437
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:20,460
and you can turn that into a form, so you'll find a link in today's show notes, just

1438
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:25,260
fill out some demographic information and everyone can see the results so beware, you know.

1439
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:29,260
They won't have your name attached to it, but everyone can see the results kind of make an open source

1440
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:34,260
thing, so we get a better understanding of who we are and what we're doing as this group here

1441
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:37,260
we call the knuckles Charlie heads.

1442
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:38,260
It's Friday.

1443
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:39,260
It's Friday.

1444
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:43,260
I'm a day Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Thursday, Friday.

1445
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:46,260
I'm a spinal button for the Wii.

1446
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:51,260
So of course, you know, I was rather harsh with my British friends early on in the program,

1447
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,260
but I'm pretty serious man.

1448
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:56,860
I think we should start thinking about doing something because you've got to take matters

1449
01:10:56,860 --> 01:11:02,260
in your own hands at a certain point and, you know, at least walk the streets and let someone know

1450
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:07,260
that you're unhappy about this and all these little organizations, you know, government organizations

1451
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:11,260
who are striking for more pay, that's one thing, that just inconvenience is awesome.

1452
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:17,260
By the way, we're paying their salaries, so I think that we should really consider this flash mob idea

1453
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:22,260
to stop the snoop dog nation because that's exactly what's going on here and is out of control.

1454
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:27,260
Go ahead, look around, Google it, look at some news articles, pay attention to what people are talking about.

1455
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:30,260
It's really, it's really frightening.

1456
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:35,260
Now I don't want that to be the final thought of the week, of course, because I think that song

1457
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:36,260
pretty much said it all.

1458
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:38,260
I feel like I'm living in sunshine.

1459
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:41,260
I don't mind sharing some of my sunshine with you.

1460
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:51,260
Adam at podshow.com, dailysourceco.com, for all the show notes.

1461
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:55,260
Please live your life with passion and enjoy your freedom.
