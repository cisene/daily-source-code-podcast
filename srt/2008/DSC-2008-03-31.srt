00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That of course was a wikacity with never going to give you a chance to get so long

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,400
has been running through my head for quite a few days now.

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,000
Well it's about time for me to get out of here and clear the booth for Adam Curry here

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,400
on the WDSC, he's got a mix of the soundtrack of our lives, the indie music from the

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,000
PodSafe music network, political commentary, of course you recalls your emails and your

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
tweets.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
All in his Delta Sierra Charlie 741.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's here on WDSC.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's a wikacity with never going to give you a chance to get so long

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
has been running through my head for quite a few days now.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That of course was a wikacity with never going to give you a chance to get so long

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:27,000
has been running through my head for quite a few days now.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That of course was a wikacity with never going to give you a chance to get so long

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
has been running through my head for quite a few days now.

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That of course was a wikacity with never going to give you a chance to get so long

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:16,000
has been running through my head for quite a few days now.

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That of course was a wikacity with never going to give you a chance to get so long

19
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:34,000
has been running through my head for quite a few days now.

20
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That of course was a wikacity with never going to give you a chance to get so long

21
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:32,000
has been running through my head for quite a few days now.

22
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That of course was a wikacity with never going to give you a chance to get so long

23
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:58,000
has been running through my head for quite a few days now.

24
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That of course was a wikacity with never going to give you a chance to get so long

25
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:30,000
has been running through my head for quite a few days now.

26
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That of course was a wikacity with never going to give you a chance to get so long

27
00:05:46,000 --> 00:06:02,000
has been running through my head for quite a few days now.

28
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That of course was a wikacity with never going to give you a chance to get so long

29
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:40,000
has been running through my head for quite a few days now.

30
00:06:40,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That of course was a wikacity with never going to give you a chance to get so long

31
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:17,000
has been running through my head for quite a few days now.

32
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That of course was a wikacity with never going to give you a chance to get so long

33
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:54,000
has been running through my head for quite a few days now.

34
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That of course was a wikacity with never going to give you a chance to get so long

35
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
has been running through my head for quite a few days now.

36
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In the 70s there's only been a handful of fatalities and I'm sure most of them were

37
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
due to pilot error.

38
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Very interested of course to see what happened but it was quite tragic the way this went down

39
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
in the crash into a couple of houses.

40
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This made the news in the United States the fact that the French president was over here

41
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
not much but the fact that a jet went down big deal.

42
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But it is of course always tragic a bad day, bad day for aviation.

43
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It was really sweet everyone was like checking and saying hey man is that you I was getting

44
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Skype messages, I am and tweets and all kinds of really concerned people and that was of course

45
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
appreciated but I'm okay.

46
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Had it been a little bit different I had the lady Patricia not been in the Netherlands.

47
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I would have had my ass out on the west coast because on Saturday it was a surprise birthday party

48
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and I was really planning on being there.

49
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I actually already pre-books but I just had to stay here with the house and the teenager

50
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
you know dangerous combination.

51
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And of course I had known about this for months and a lot of people were new about it

52
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and I think we kept it from it.

53
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I don't think he had any idea what was going to go down.

54
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I hope he had a really good time and happy 40th birthday mark.

55
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Welcome to the club my friend.

56
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You are now just as screwed as the rest of us.

57
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Kind of cool though I look like everyone is figured out the live 365 live stream

58
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
apparently in order to get it to work you might have to refresh the page a couple of times

59
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
until it says that the station is actually online but for the past like hour and a half

60
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I've been just playing music in a couple of jingles.

61
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh yeah it's filled up now.

62
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Now we got like 150 people listening.

63
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's good.

64
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Although it maxes out if you're not registered or if you're not a VIP member I'm sure that

65
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
means you have to pay money which kind of sucks.

66
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
There's like a 60 person limit but there's lots of VIP members on so that's good.

67
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm paying 99 bucks a month for this service and I'm not really happy with it.

68
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I also don't really think those limitations are great.

69
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
However any music I play they do pay royalties to the artist or at least that's part of their

70
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
pitch so that's why I chose to go with live 365 we'll see what happens.

71
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Lots of other ways to get a clean high-deft stream out to you guys but right now just

72
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
have to leave it at this.

73
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's about five minutes to five and very busy here today.

74
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Lots of conference calls of course we moved over to British standard time I think.

75
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So we moved the clock ahead an hour now we're back in tune with the United States with an eight-hour

76
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
difference between London and San Francisco and five hours between London and New York.

77
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And still one hour I guess one hour difference with the rest of Europe.

78
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah all of Europe changed.

79
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Interesting.

80
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We're all on track.

81
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I got some cool for you.

82
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So what I wanted to say is the lady Patricia probably should be home in about an hour so she

83
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
may come home just at the tail end of the show.

84
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm looking forward to seeing her she's been away for an entire week so.

85
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And I've been playing Mr. Mom.

86
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's been challenging to say the least.

87
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You hear the damn dog.

88
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Whenever I'm up here it's been this way all week long.

89
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The dog just keeps barking.

90
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I bring him up here and then he wants to go downstairs.

91
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's like 15 years old and he's a Yorkie and it's not very mobile and it sucks.

92
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Just looking at the Twitter messages coming in from that hour and a half of music I was playing.

93
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Kieran Johnson said now it's exciting kind of like a concert waiting for a gig to start.

94
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And we've got to truck our loo listening in from Grand Rapids.

95
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Michigan through a sprint broadband internet in his tractor trailer,

96
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
waiting to unload some chocolate chips.

97
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And everyone else seems to be good to go.

98
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I got a premiere of sorts for you today.

99
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Let me just see if I can find the actually it's probably fine that email.

100
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
A couple of weeks ago, let me see.

101
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Hold on.

102
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Sorry not incredibly prepared for this one.

103
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
A couple of weeks ago I received when the when the credit crunch crisis just started off.

104
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I received an email.

105
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And this of course is what I'm looking for.

106
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Hold on.

107
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Wait.

108
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Where is it?

109
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Where is it?

110
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Where is it?

111
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Ah, here it is.

112
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
No.

113
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Here we go.

114
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Got it.

115
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Okay, of course.

116
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I got it from Paul Parkinson.

117
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
There you go.

118
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
He sent me an email.

119
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So this is doing the rounds in the dealing rooms and back offices of the city of London today,

120
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
which now this is 11 days ago, March 20th, when he sent me this email.

121
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And essentially it's a, it's a, it's a, a parody, parody lyrics.

122
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Written to the tune of Queens Bohemian Rhapsody.

123
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And of course this is typically now.

124
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This is what these traders, they'll send all kinds of stuff around.

125
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And it gets really, really viral.

126
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And so I'm thinking to myself, hey, this is interesting.

127
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So I forwarded it to Jeff Smith and said,

128
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
dude, might be a hoot to record.

129
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But took a couple days and Jeff got back to me and said, oh, man, I've been sick for the past week.

130
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The voice has been shot.

131
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Just getting my pipes back.

132
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I think it's an interesting idea.

133
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And I even said in the past seven days, you know, I said, hey, man,

134
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
the crisis will last.

135
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Don't worry.

136
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's not going to go away.

137
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And I knew that these lyrics are really funny.

138
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
If you're in the financial business, so nylon, pay attention.

139
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This is for you, my friend.

140
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But others of you may also appreciate it.

141
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If not, if not for that, for the fact that Jeff does this just an amazing job on stuff.

142
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So here it is.

143
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's the Bohemian financial rhapsody Jeff Smith on the Charlie.

144
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Is this the real price?

145
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Is this just fantasy?

146
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Financial landslide?

147
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
We're escape from reality.

148
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Open your eyes.

149
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Look up at your buys and see.

150
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't know a boy, boy.

151
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Heilin' casualty.

152
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Cause I bought it high.

153
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Watch it blow.

154
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Rating high.

155
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Now you'll know.

156
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
In a way the fan goes doesn't really matter.

157
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
To me, to me.

158
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Mama, just killed my friend.

159
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Could it sitios instead?

160
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Pulled the trigger now it's dead.

161
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Mama, I had just begun.

162
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
These sitios have blown it all away.

163
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Mama, I still want to buy.

164
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Sometimes we should never let go of it all.

165
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I see a little silhouette of a fan.

166
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But I can't but I can't say the whole market.

167
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But I don't know the new, yes.

168
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Where did everybody be?

169
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Super senior.

170
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Super senior.

171
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Super senior.

172
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Super senior.

173
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Super senior.

174
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I never go.

175
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm on a surprise video fantasy.

176
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm on a surprise video fantasy.

177
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm on a surprise video fantasy.

178
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Easy come, easy come.

179
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You, let me go.

180
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh, I know it's over!

181
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
No, no, no, no!

182
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Get out, get out of the door!

183
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh, for me, for me!

184
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So you think you could find me and spit in my eye?

185
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Then the bottom and call me and leave me a tie.

186
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby.

187
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Just got it out, just got it right out of here.

188
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So you think you could find me and spit in my eye?

189
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So you think you could find me and spit in my eye?

190
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Then the bottom and call me and spit in my eye.

191
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Sorry, I don't know where to go.

192
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:15,000
No price really matters, no liquidity, nothing really matters

193
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
No price really matters to me

194
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Just Smith with the Bohemian Financial Wrap, you can find Jeff at thejfsmith.com

195
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Jeff Spell, G-E-O-F-F, thejfsmith.com, fantastic

196
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And I know the guys in the city and Wall Street are going to love this

197
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I have no idea how Jeff wants to release it

198
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Obviously it's completely covered under fair use because it's a parody

199
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So hopefully this will make the rounds

200
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'll just link to his website in the show notes at dailysourceco.com

201
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So you can find either way to download it or whatever Jeff decides

202
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome, I love it

203
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That was so cool

204
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Let me see, speaking of the Fed, I love that bit in the song

205
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I see a little silhouette on the Fed, Barnaki, Barnaki

206
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Fantastic, a lot of people sent me this link

207
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I think the New York Times had the exclusive on this

208
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The Bush administration is now suggesting that they give the federal reserve power

209
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You gotta love this, to regulate the financial sector

210
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
As a part of a financial regulation overhaul

211
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
This, of course, is laughable

212
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
A superagent key, I gotta talk to him later

213
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's laughable because the Fed is, of course, responsible for what has happened

214
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Not necessarily directly responsible for the credit crunch, but responsible for everything else

215
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
In the way they're dealing with it already

216
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
By basically printing money, causing inflation

217
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And I hope you had a chance over the weekend to look at that documentary

218
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I told you about the money masters

219
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Now, I also discussed it with John C. Dvorak and asked him to watch it over the weekend

220
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Because he wasn't familiar with it, he hated it

221
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He thought it was full of lies, the quotes were bullshit

222
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
He even felt that had an antisemitic twins to it

223
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Which I didn't pick up on

224
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And so while I think he's pretty good with his research in his history

225
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So a lot of the stuff that he's talking about

226
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
May, or that he says is BS, may indeed be BS

227
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
A lot of things, particularly when the story picks up around Andrew Jackson

228
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And you look at how the second bank of America was put together

229
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And the concept of fractional, or the fact fractional reserve banking

230
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Or lending

231
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Once you understand those concepts, which do kick in after the first hour of this documentary

232
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Well actually the beginning, even if the quotes are on true, the concept remains the same

233
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And that concept is that the people who really control the earth

234
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Who really control what your rent is going to be, or what your mortgage payment

235
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Or your car payment, or how much money you'll have in your pocket at the end of the month

236
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Is determined by the central bank

237
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
For the United States, the Federal Reserve, which has nothing to do with the government

238
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It is not a governmental organization, it is a commercial bank

239
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Who have the exclusive right to print dollars

240
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And lend those dollars to the United States government

241
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Okay, that's how it works

242
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And those dollars that are lent that are printed out of thin air

243
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And are lent to the US government

244
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Are guaranteed against taxes

245
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So every single time you see the Federal Reserve printed up some money

246
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That's going to cost you one way or the other

247
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Same, interestingly enough, goes for the bank of England

248
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Which is also a very deceptive name

249
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The bank of England is not belong to the country, to the government

250
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Or to the Queen

251
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Again, it is a commercial bank

252
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And they have the right to print the money

253
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And lend the money to the government

254
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So, as a part of this, and I can tell you what's coming next

255
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Excuse me, I get all worked up, but I just got a burp

256
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But I think about what's going on, it makes me nauseous

257
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The next crunch you're going to get is the credit card crunch

258
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You can be ready for it, take a look at your statements at the end of the month

259
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You're probably paying anywhere between 20 and 25% interest

260
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And these guys can raise this rate at any time

261
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
They can change their terms of services

262
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's really, really a bad deal

263
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And you watch again to you, that's the next thing everyone's going to be focusing on

264
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I think we're talking about that

265
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And we're going to find out that we are royally, royally screwed

266
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Gotta comment here, which was actually intended for no agenda

267
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But I gotta tell you, we had such a good show, we did it on Saturday

268
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I wanted to play this for you because I think this guy is right

269
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
In his analysis of why that show was working, which is basically just two old guys talking crap

270
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Oh James, second time around it's Dan

271
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
New Yorker and Fort Lauderdale

272
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And by the way, Dan, you got to call into the Charlie Moroff

273
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And I love you, man

274
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
New Yorker and Fort Lauderdale was up Dan

275
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
In 1990, I know you guys are going to talk about the lady detained by the TSA

276
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And for us to remove a nipple rings

277
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Now, interestingly enough, we don't talk about newsworthy stuff like that

278
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Dan, in fact, we tried to stay away from the stupid shit that everyone

279
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm sure they talked about that on Twitter

280
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Now, that's not what we talk about

281
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But what I really wanted to say, although John is amazing

282
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And he's wonderful person too

283
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
He's different to listen to with Adam is talking with him

284
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Adam is a catalyst in the whole dynamic changes

285
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And everything and everyone both you guys become better

286
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So, to listen to Adam and John on Tificate

287
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And talk about the days of your and whatever else

288
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
That you guys want to comment on is very interesting

289
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But it's different than listening to the daily source code

290
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Or text five

291
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Or even John's occasional clips onto it

292
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
No agenda is more dynamic

293
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Because the ingredients match well together

294
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Something to do with that you guys screw in your own juices

295
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And it's very savory

296
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Dan out

297
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
No more hope you win, Bonnie

298
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Alright baby, thank you

299
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Don't tell me you were from Brooklyn

300
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Because I got to feeling, you know what I'm saying?

301
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Dan from former New Yorker

302
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Living in Fort Lauderdale

303
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
In exile, I'm sure

304
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I agree with you

305
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I totally agree, I've been analyzing this

306
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Actually, you know, and if you listen to the daily source code

307
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Give that show a listen, will you please?

308
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Will it kill you to listen to it?

309
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
A particular last one, which was episode number 24

310
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
By the way, if you think you're hearing bells in the background

311
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It's not its birds birds because the sun just broke through

312
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And they're waking up in their saints

313
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Springtime, yes, we set our clocks forward, we're ready

314
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Um, we really do a lot of work on the show

315
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Without actually doing any work on the show

316
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So while we don't do any preparation

317
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Except maybe individual preparation

318
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You know, it's like, oh, I'll bring this go

319
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's just like, I'm calling the guy, right?

320
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And we've been doing this during the week anyway

321
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And at one point, you know, I just say, hey man

322
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
We had these great conversations

323
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Maybe we should consider recording him

324
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And just putting them out as a show

325
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So, but we really think a lot about the format of the show

326
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Which, of course, there is none, but the timing of the show

327
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And actually we left you with a cliffhanger on Friday show

328
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And we'll see how we handle that next week

329
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But it says quite an interesting experiment

330
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And I really, yeah, I really enjoy doing that

331
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Emiel Calloff sends me a tweet here on Twitter

332
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And he says, yeah, it's not money backed with gold

333
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah, so that of course is the premise

334
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Is that the money the central banks print

335
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Is secured against gold

336
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Well, that went away many, many years ago, my friend

337
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It is

338
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Who's someone here saying the Bank of England is wholly owned by the state

339
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I don't think so

340
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Pretty sure that's not true

341
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I could be wrong, but I'm doing a show

342
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And I'm pontificating, so I got no time to check that out

343
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Graham Shaw

344
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Of course, I got a lot of comments about Friday show

345
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
As I discussed, Fittna

346
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
The movie

347
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And I wanted to point out some things that

348
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
To me, we're pretty obvious, but I don't think

349
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
They're coming through just looking at some random

350
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Postings around the net

351
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
The main reason, first of all, I wanted to discuss this

352
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And the issues that are plaguing the Netherlands

353
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And in other countries as well in the United Kingdom

354
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
These issues are also starting to bubble up

355
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Is because I don't hear people talking about it

356
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You don't hear people speaking their minds freely

357
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And saying what they, what they really think

358
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Because they're afraid of being labeled a racist

359
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Everything from a racist to a nationalist to a Nazi

360
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And I think that the Daily Source Coach

361
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
To be a no PC zone, okay?

362
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
No political correctness, no condemnation

363
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
All right, so if someone has an issue and they have a problem

364
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Like in the Netherlands, I think this was the point of this movie

365
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It was not meant to shock

366
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I think it was meant to show the disfads satisfaction

367
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
With the incumbent indigenous peoples of the Netherlands

368
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
About what's happened to their country

369
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It was more a strong message to the government

370
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Of course, if completely responded inappropriately

371
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And I can't imagine they're actually missing the point

372
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But it seems like they are

373
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You know, they're defending this

374
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Is saying, you know, week, we condemn this hate of Islam

375
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And I don't think the movie was about that

376
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I think the movie was about saying hey, look, here's what's happening

377
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
In our country

378
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And I did that with a number of newspaper articles

379
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And as a large majority of people

380
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Maybe it's not a majority

381
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I think that needs to be found out as well

382
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
But I believe it's a majority, a silent majority

383
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Who are really worried about their own culture

384
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
In this non-immigration country

385
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Please remember, the Netherlands is a little bit different

386
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Than most European countries

387
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Because of its size and population density

388
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I believe it is the second most densely populated country

389
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
On earth after Japan

390
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Maybe after China

391
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
But it's in the top five, I'm quite sure

392
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It's a little pimple of a country

393
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And there's 16 million people living there

394
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Most of this country is underwater

395
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It wasn't even above ground until the 50s and 60s

396
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And that's where people are living now

397
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Literally they reclaimed land

398
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And built on a huge cities

399
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Literally in the poles

400
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And the culture has changed dramatically

401
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Not just with becoming a member of the European Union

402
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Giving up their sovereign funds as the gilder

403
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And moving to the euro

404
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
But also just in general the way politics have worked

405
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And the concept of integrating a multicultural society

406
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I just don't think people are ready for it

407
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But now everyone's worried

408
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And I see this happening everywhere

409
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Things that people say in private

410
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Amongst a couple of people or maybe a group

411
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Well, well, well vetted out to make sure you don't piss off anyone

412
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Who's in the group

413
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It's very different from the political correctness that people are

414
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
That's coming out of people's mouths

415
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
In public

416
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Certainly in mainstream media

417
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So if this media that we're doing is worth anything

418
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
If it's worth any shit at all

419
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's got to be that we can have a conversation

420
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Without people going off the handle and yelling about racism

421
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And not seeism and anti-anythingism

422
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Okay, so we're going to keep this a politically correct free zone

423
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Because it's really important

424
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
We can just talk amongst each ourselves

425
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And not immediately get a label slapped on

426
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Okay, because that is just not productive

427
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And as long as people are just talking

428
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I think it's a relatively safe

429
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Oh, James, second time around

430
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It's Dan

431
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Oh, sorry, wrong one I meant this one

432
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Hello, Adam Curry in the Charlie

433
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Billion here from the mildly affluent suburb of Irving Texas

434
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Known as law coiners

435
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I had started to leave you a message earlier at him

436
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
But got cut off, my basic point is

437
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And I'd love to have you bring this up on the Charlie and on no agenda

438
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's just seeming like more and more people in the US

439
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And I'm not sure how this is working out in Europe now

440
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Just absolutely cannot, cannot factor, cannot mitigate, cannot determine

441
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Risk in their lives

442
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And you know, the heightened sense of terror that we have

443
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
is part of the problem

444
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But it's also, you know, with people's ability to eat

445
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Appropriately to exercise

446
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Just it seems like every single thing we do in our lives

447
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
We're just not factoring the balance

448
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Correctly anymore

449
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And we're unbelievably frightened by something

450
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You know the airport security

451
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Or dying in a plane crash

452
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And yet at the same time, you know

453
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Everybody gets on a major highway every day

454
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Even though traffic fatalities are

455
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
One of the top killers

456
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And it's just one of those things

457
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It's got me sociologically

458
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Interspot is there a phenomena there

459
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Has that changed in 50 years

460
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Maybe it's all the same

461
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Anyways, I'd love you know homo

462
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Great hair, hope you win

463
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And let's keep talking man

464
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It's good stuff

465
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It keeps the dialogue open

466
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
We've got a lot of everybody know that

467
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
The world's got to change one day to time

468
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Thank you

469
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Absolutely, thank you

470
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm just trying to expose everyone to as many things as possible that I find interesting

471
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
At least you look, I'm not forcing you to listen to this show

472
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So that's exactly the point

473
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I guarantee you in today's newspapers

474
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
You'll read about a business yet

475
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Where two people died tragic

476
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Particularly because they were well known, famous people

477
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
But you did not know unless you're listening to this show

478
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
About the French president

479
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Calling for a strong new brotherhood between France

480
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And the United Kingdom

481
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Which can affect millions of people

482
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And talking about forces in war areas

483
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I mean it's a lot going on, you know

484
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
So yeah, it's the same thing

485
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's all the part of the same thing

486
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Like I'm really afraid to fly it

487
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yeah, I'll drive on the highway and nothing's wrong

488
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It's like my daughter, it's like it is teenage or attitude

489
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
She doesn't like flying with it

490
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Not particularly if she can avoid it

491
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
She's like flying it all, she's afraid

492
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Understandably so she's grown up with all kinds of disaster movies

493
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And all kinds of great coverage of crashes and air disasters

494
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
This is a show in every single night here

495
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Which is called air crash investigation

496
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You can always can't avoid it when you're flipping through the channels

497
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Yet she can't wait to jump in her car and drive around

498
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
The A3

499
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Where the average speed is 70 miles an hour, 60 miles an hour

500
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
You know, and I think I know better

501
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
By the way, for people who say that the Bank of England is state owned

502
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
That's the history

503
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
The federal reserve was also

504
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Initially funded 20% of it was funded by the United States government

505
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Of course the other 80% was put in by commercial banks

506
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
But the way they did that is this fractional lending

507
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So by law a bank can lend out 10 times more

508
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Then it actually has

509
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Got it

510
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So they got the 20% from the government

511
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And then lent that out 10 times over to other banks

512
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Who then turned around and put that right back in

513
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And said, here's our contribution

514
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's a great scam

515
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It makes me want to get into banking, I'm telling

516
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Let's see some more comments over

517
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I think fit in other movie and stuff that people were looking at over the weekend

518
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Hi Adam, this is Justin

519
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Two things maybe to watch this week

520
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And the first one I think was money masters or something like that

521
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I think I saw a movie similar to that

522
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Basically what I talked about was

523
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Money or a rather sea out currency equal debt

524
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
After seeing that movie I thought

525
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I need to go by gold because if I'm not wrong

526
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Isn't gold inflation proof?

527
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Well that's a well inflation proof

528
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It depends on how you define inflation

529
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But gold is of course very valuable right now

530
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
A thousand dollars more over a thousand dollars of Troy ounce

531
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And this always happens when there is

532
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And there are fluctuations

533
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Or inflation in the market

534
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Or risk of inflation people run to gold because

535
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Fuck everyone else does

536
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I don't know

537
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm not the hell

538
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Where's the nylon when you need him

539
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I wonder if the nylon still has a job actually

540
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And is that why we all need to buy gold

541
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Is so that we can be free from

542
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Inflation

543
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And then the other movie you told us to go watch

544
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Was over on a live leak

545
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I think

546
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I don't know how to pronounce this

547
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Feet no

548
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Feet no

549
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Feet no?

550
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Feet no?

551
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So I went over to live leak

552
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And I said oh we had to take the movie down because we were going to

553
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Frate we were going to get

554
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Kill death threats

555
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Whatever

556
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So I went over to a good friends at Pirate Bay

557
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I entered it

558
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And I found it so I'm downloading it now

559
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And hopefully I can watch it here in a couple minutes

560
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Alright peace

561
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Alright man

562
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Very curious to see what you think of both of those

563
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Yeah I saw they removed it from live like

564
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Because they were getting threats

565
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Yeah whatever

566
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's all just a conversation

567
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
First of all we can't be afraid

568
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
To just talk people

569
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
We should be able to speak our minds

570
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Amongst ourselves

571
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
The freedom of speech is not number one

572
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Everything forgets this political correctness

573
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You just can't be afraid to offend people

574
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So again here on the daily source code

575
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You can't offend anyone

576
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Okay it's a politically correct free zone

577
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
No one should feel offended

578
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's just words we're just talking

579
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Just trying to figure stuff out

580
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It's look I'm old

581
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I'm going to be 44 in September

582
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Now I got nothing left to prove

583
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I trying to make this world a little better place

584
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Trying to understand it

585
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So I can pass some of that on to the next generation

586
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Who I have to admit

587
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Even though my daughter is creative

588
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And brilliant and smart and beautiful

589
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
These kids

590
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
They had nothing looking forward to nothing

591
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Not that there's nothing to look forward to

592
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
They got nothing that they're looking forward to

593
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
There's just some care

594
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
They just are

595
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
This is not good

596
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Yeah we need to inspire them

597
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
We need to

598
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
We need to lead by example

599
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Adam Jason from San Diego

600
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I just

601
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm calling as your bunch

602
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So not drunk

603
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
But San Diego

604
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Okay

605
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
You know I love people who call up drunk

606
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Because they always tell the truth

607
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I understand why initially

608
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You played that

609
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
The video about multiculturalism

610
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And Islam

611
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Not being welcomed in

612
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
That's areas

613
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Or the Netherlands

614
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yeah so

615
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Let me just state some other thing

616
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's not about Islam

617
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It's about immigration

618
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
You know what you could call

619
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
If in fact I believe the most Dutch people

620
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
If they're speaking openly and freely

621
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
They'll talk specifically about Moroccans

622
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
They feel that Moroccans are troublemakers

623
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Not all Moroccans are muslims

624
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And I think this

625
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I think someone else is promoting the anti-Muslim agenda

626
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I don't think that is necessarily the people

627
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
They just see Moroccans

628
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And look

629
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Of course it's not all Moroccans either

630
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
But they are guests in the country

631
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
In fact the Netherlands used to call immigrants guest workers

632
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I don't know if that's still is used anywhere

633
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And I think that they might have had some similar problems

634
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
In the past maybe with the English

635
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
When they came in lots of English word guest workers

636
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And they would beat everyone up and get drunk

637
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And mess up the bars

638
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Yeah, so this is not new

639
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And it used to be maluckers

640
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And whenever there's a new group that's migrating

641
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Into the country it causes issues

642
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Because it's not an immigration country

643
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It's not like the United States

644
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Where what truly is a multicultural society

645
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
In my humble opinion

646
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And there's so many entitlements

647
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
In the Netherlands being a socialist country

648
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So many entitlements

649
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
That you get if you're out of work or sad or poor

650
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Or incapacitated

651
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Or for instance don't speak the language

652
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And just might not want to do anything

653
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Or also have nothing to look forward to

654
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
No immediate future

655
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
No culture that entices you to learn the language

656
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Or follow the law

657
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I mean this is all these little little things build up

658
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And I think people get extremely frustrated with it

659
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
All right, backslash

660
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I understand it now

661
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
The first time I heard it

662
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I thought it was just rhetoric

663
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Stupid, you know, racist rhetoric

664
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I understand why you played it now

665
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I don't see it as much as racist

666
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
However I do see it a bit like

667
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Nationalism

668
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
You know

669
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Anyway, that's just my two cents

670
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Yeah, I can understand where the nationalism comes from

671
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
But again, we're not going to call each other names

672
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Because nationalism immediately implies

673
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Fascism or Nazism

674
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And I think people are very proud of their country

675
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
You know, I can't make jokes about the Netherlands to my wife

676
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I will from time to time

677
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I'll say hey, how's that Holland's got no talent show

678
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And she'll get really pissed off

679
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
She says, you know, don't talk about my fucking country that way

680
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Okay, and she's proud of it

681
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
She's proud of being from Rotterdam

682
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
She's proud of the country

683
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
She doesn't want to live there

684
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Because she doesn't like the way the government is managing things

685
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
She just doesn't like the way the place is being run

686
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So that's why she's happy to not be there

687
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
But she loves the country

688
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Does that make her a nationalist or just proud of her heritage?

689
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
That's the question

690
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Nationalism for the Netherlands

691
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I think that it's that it's one person's view of the Quran

692
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You know, if somebody, if he could say that he read the Quran

693
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Versus people telling them what it says

694
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Me having read the Quran or at least a large portion of it

695
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Having read the Torah, having read the Bible

696
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Because those very interested in religious crap

697
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I understand that all these religions have a fundamental goal

698
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Which is life

699
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And like you say passion

700
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
They all have that fundamentally

701
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
They all have some small parts of violence

702
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
They all have it

703
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
They all have some negative aspects towards women

704
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
But you know what?

705
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
They all talk about how it is important to love their neighbour

706
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And respect each other

707
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
So I'm going to leave it that day

708
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Before I continue on and sound stupid

709
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
No way man, not at all

710
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And also we should make it a

711
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Charlie a religion free zone

712
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
This is not about religion

713
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
That is probably what the Bush administration wants you to think

714
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Because that plays well into their war on terror

715
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Plans

716
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
It's not about religion

717
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
It's about immigration

718
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
It's about adhering to the written laws

719
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And yes, yes

720
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
In some ways to the cultural laws of a country

721
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Some things are just not done

722
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Here in the UK

723
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Even languages

724
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Things

725
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You can't say

726
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Certain things

727
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
If I were to say

728
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Bloody, some bloody messed up

729
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
That's actually

730
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Consider a lot worse than the UK

731
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Than it sounds in the US

732
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And the use of certain words

733
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Which I won't even repeat here

734
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Like the C word

735
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Is used in common conversation all the time

736
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
All the time the Charlie uniform November 10

737
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
You know

738
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You don't use that in the US at all

739
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Ever

740
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Not even guys amongst each other

741
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
We'll use that

742
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But here in a small group

743
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
People will use that word easily

744
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It's

745
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
That's quite amazing to me

746
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
So anyway, so when you have immigration

747
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
We have migration of any form

748
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And by the way, war causes migration

749
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
There's a lot of Iraqis living in Western Europe right now

750
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I think probably 2 million at least fled the country

751
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And drove by the way

752
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It's not that hard to drive from Iraq

753
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
To further west or wind up in Holland

754
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
If you want to

755
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
These are

756
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Refugees

757
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Not Muslims

758
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
The refugees

759
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Okay

760
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And that's another point of contention

761
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The way refugees are handled

762
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
In these small countries

763
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
That are not immigration based

764
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
So there's a lot of stuff that we can talk about

765
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And I'm just kind of spouting here at the hip

766
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Coming in on Twitter

767
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Seemless slavery says Adam

768
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Same here in Belgium with the Moroccans

769
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Again, that's a generalization

770
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
But it is an immigrated group that is immigrated

771
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And there seems to be issues

772
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Then I think probably people are not happy with the government

773
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Is addressing them

774
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
If I read anything

775
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
What really seems to piss people off

776
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Is when you have these enclaves of

777
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Anti-social behavior

778
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Let's just call it that

779
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Anti-social behavior

780
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And the elected officials

781
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Of the government go and

782
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And hang out with religious leaders

783
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And drink tea and talk about integration

784
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Yeah, no

785
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
It's like that's just not the way it works

786
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
The people of countries, all countries

787
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Are held

788
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Almost as slaves by taxes, by laws

789
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And you look over to the left

790
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And you say, wait a minute

791
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
These guys

792
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
They come in here, they get all these entitlements

793
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
If they break stuff

794
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Or if the kids are causing the ruckus

795
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Then the kids aren't thrown in jail

796
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Like my kids would be that seems like they're getting different treatment

797
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
That's and whether it's true or not

798
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
That is the perception

799
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And at the end of the day, perception is reality

800
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
One more

801
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Amy will call off

802
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It's not just the kids

803
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
They lack upbringing

804
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
They just happen to be Moroccan

805
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
They should go after the parents

806
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Absolutely

807
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Absolutely

808
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Go after the parents

809
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
They do that in for

810
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
In other countries

811
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
They're starting to think of doing a lot of that

812
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Here in the UK

813
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
With these anti-social behavior kids

814
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I mean

815
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
All right, I need a break for a second

816
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
This is on the pod save music network

817
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Which I kind of dig

818
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Because I know you're going to recognize

819
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
The song from the MacBook Air commercials

820
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Check it out

821
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And you so I came to this train

822
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
World open

823
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I could learn a bit about how to give and take

824
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
But since I came here

825
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Felt a joy and I'll fear

826
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Biting myself making every possible mistake

827
00:46:35,000 --> 00:47:05,000
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

828
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:13,640
I'll teach hate, try to come and eat, hate, fight, you trust and love is not always easy to make

829
00:47:35,000 --> 00:48:00,520
This is a happy end, cause you don't understand

830
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:12,600
Everything you have done, why's everything so wrong?

831
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:21,520
This is a happy end, come and give me your hand, I'll take you far away

832
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:30,520
I'm a new soul, I can't get this great world hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and stay

833
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:40,520
But since I came here, felt the joy on the field finding myself making every possible mistake

834
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:47,520
When we're all alone, we're not alone, nothing's very straight away

835
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:56,520
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone

836
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:14,520
You're alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, yeah

837
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:20,520
I really liked that model you know, the way this was set up

838
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,520
So first it's far as I know, first there was a commercial for the MacBook Air

839
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,920
And then so the artists makes their money.

840
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,520
And then they release it anywhere and everywhere.

841
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,520
Just go enjoy it.

842
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,120
That's a great model.

843
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:35,920
I really like it.

844
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,320
Not a lot of room to do that

845
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,920
and that every commercial will work that way.

846
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,520
But wow.

847
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,640
Y'all nagging, I think as I pronounced the name of that young lady,

848
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,720
new soul and it's on the pod save music network.

849
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,320
Of course, links in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

850
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,520
Just following up on the tweet,

851
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,420
see Miss Leavery says easy for the populist to blame.

852
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,320
One ethnic group, especially if that group

853
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,120
is not trying to integrate absolutely Jamaican in New York.

854
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,720
The kids everywhere are starting to lack up,

855
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,720
bringing the same thing as going on in Jamaica.

856
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
Well, that also is an issue.

857
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,720
Although I think that is an issue.

858
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,520
You know, there's a look at the United Kingdom.

859
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,120
All the kids are drinking themselves to death.

860
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,520
I'd say that's an issue right there.

861
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,320
Before I forget today's episode is brought to you

862
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,120
by Acute.com.

863
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,520
I have a feeling that as we move closer

864
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,320
through this non-religion, non-political correctness zone,

865
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,320
I might want to think about some life insurance.

866
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,320
So I'm going to call them myself.

867
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:36,520
I can get up to 70% discount on life insurance.

868
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:42,720
You can go to acute.com slash DSC to get your incredible discount.

869
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,320
Or you can call a US and this is for US resident only, US phone number.

870
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:51,320
1-800-410-7214 and then over thought

871
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,920
I'll be selling life insurance, huh?

872
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,320
I love that.

873
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,920
All right, everybody.

874
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,320
No show tomorrow because I will be doing

875
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,920
Mucho Plento meetings in the city.

876
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,320
So of course, I'll be back for the hump day edition.

877
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,620
Thank you all very much for listening

878
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:09,520
on the live stream at live365.com.

879
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,520
Everyone stayed on.

880
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,520
It's like no one dropped off.

881
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,520
It's cool.

882
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,920
And perhaps perhaps we should be taking phone calls

883
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:17,720
in the near future.

884
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,520
So I'm pretty much set up for it.

885
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,720
So whatever you do today for the rest of your day,

886
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,720
if you're winding it down or for it's tomorrow

887
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,720
and you live in Australia, live your life with passion

888
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,920
and enjoy your freedom.
