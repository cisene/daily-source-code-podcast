1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So tell me, how long have you been having these delusions?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Well, doctor, it all started daily in dreams, the paranoia about the oil companies.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I guess it all started from listening to the daily source code.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There you go again, it's your delusions of the daily source code.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But, but doctor, doctor, it's a show without him curry.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes, you say it is a show, but of course you have the delusions.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The delusions of it being daily.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What do you mean, doctor?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well, this Adam Curry doesn't actually make a show every day.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's sometimes a Wednesday, sometimes a food bar Friday, sometimes a Tuesday,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but never it is a daily.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This delusions, they're getting in your way.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You'll never recover as long as you continue to think of this as a daily source code.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So, so, doctor, what's the solution? What can I do?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, you must, you must come up with another word for the, the, the, the daily source code.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Perhaps it is the delusional source code.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So here it is the delusional source code.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
With Adam Curry, the, the, the number, seven, seven, six.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Through the, you have another word for the, you have another word for the, you have another word for the, you have another word,

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
you have another word for the, you have another word for the, you have another word for the, you have another word for the, you have another word for the, you have another word for the,

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
you have another word to be a, I would like this question right?

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,000
6 billion dollars worth of airplane!

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Wipe to my ass!

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Then the next generation radio content emit yours!!

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We don't need not even know what to do to keep being serious again!

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk!

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
...

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
discard this bull!

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
аров curry!

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Am!

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,500
Hmm, this is a mom ko

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
This is a thousand of our life is a moment.

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
And we all stay alive.

34
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Of course, this is the new dreams.

35
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
And we all stay hungry.

36
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
And we all stop.

37
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,500
And we all end up with the earth.

38
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
And we all stop these stairs for you.

39
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,500
And as time goes by, we all stop.

40
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
So, so, so, so.

41
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

42
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,500
I got so much trouble on my mind.

43
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Me, it's too big.

44
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
Here's your ticket.

45
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Hit a time I can't wait.

46
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500
To pull the fuel to push the back, the back, the back, the back,

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,500
So I sat in a chatting snack, the back, now ready to make it.

48
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Here's my favorite season, low low.

49
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
You'll never be able to let needles fall low.

50
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Please let any stage of nature,

51
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Please the pleasure bringing trainer.

52
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
The way I've never put in it, what I'm giving up.

53
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
Exxon the place, now.

54
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
I don't know what about later.

55
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Past now I know how to point the flag of noise.

56
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
And I've headed up to here.

57
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Here, far away I've got to go in here.

58
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Right up instead of red just a bit of gold.

59
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Not to in this side, I'll hold on.

60
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,500
What?

61
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Keep from getting jerked fingers from waves.

62
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
So we passed him a better day.

63
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
He's home.

64
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Not a 50-bowl.

65
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Never follow his home.

66
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Still trapped the mold.

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Never question what I am God.

68
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
No, sir.

69
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Let's come and look around.

70
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
What are you talking about?

71
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
What are you talking about?

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Where did you get some?

73
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
What's up?

74
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
What's up?

75
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,500
What's up?

76
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
What's up?

77
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
What's up?

78
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
What's up?

79
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
What's up?

80
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
What's up?

81
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
What's up?

82
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
What's up?

83
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
What's up?

84
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
What's up?

85
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
What's up?

86
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
What's up?

87
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
What's up?

88
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
What's up?

89
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
What's up?

90
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
What's up?

91
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
What's up?

92
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
What's up?

93
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
What's up?

94
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
What's up?

95
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
What's up?

96
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
What's up?

97
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
What's up?

98
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
What's up?

99
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
What's up?

100
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
What's up?

101
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
What's up?

102
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
What's up?

103
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
It's all about what's up?

104
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
What's up?

105
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
What's up?

106
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
What's up?

107
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
What's up?

108
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
What's up?

109
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
What's up?

110
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
What's up?

111
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
What's up?

112
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
What's up?

113
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
What's up?

114
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
What's up?

115
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
What's up?

116
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
What's up?

117
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
What's up?

118
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
What's up?

119
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
What's up?

120
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
What's up?

121
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
What's up?

122
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,040
Come on, man, it's just the facade.

123
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,340
Okay, let's chase that child with the ball.

124
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,040
I see it all like it was in the fire.

125
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,240
Let it take out all my clothes, the plane would just be gone.

126
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,400
If you want me out of playing, give it down with y'all.

127
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,480
What's in your ventilation?

128
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,480
What's in your ventilation?

129
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
World domination.

130
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,480
The ventilation is just an energy.

131
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
It's an energy, it's an energy.

132
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
It's an energy, it's a throttle.

133
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Oh, that's a sky.

134
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
Turn it on, it's a vision.

135
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,480
If you want me to tell you what I'm gonna do,

136
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
it's my journey day.

137
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Give me that.

138
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
Come on, come on.

139
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Come on, breathe me out.

140
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Let it matter, put it down on the plane.

141
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
Give me something that you never had.

142
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Come on, come on, come on.

143
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
Come on, come on.

144
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
Come on, come on.

145
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
God bless you so much.

146
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
Come on, come on.

147
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
Come on, come on.

148
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
Come on, come on.

149
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
Welcome to the terminal.

150
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
Come on.

151
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
Come on.

152
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
Yeah.

153
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
Yeah.

154
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Discovered on the source code drop,

155
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,480
peeping off episode number 776.

156
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,480
Welcome to the terminal.

157
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
Everybody.

158
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,480
It's the Charlie coming to you from Surrey.

159
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,480
The affluent suburb.

160
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,480
That would be Gilford, G-Town.

161
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,480
I love this kind of stuff.

162
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
It's something about angry black men.

163
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
I think it really does it for me.

164
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Of course, I have no idea who it is,

165
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,480
because the tracks once again were uploaded with no data.

166
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Come on, guys.

167
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,480
When you're filling up the drop, which, of course,

168
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,480
you can find the drop.io slash daily source code.

169
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,480
It's listed in the show notes of daily source code.com,

170
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
and curry.com.

171
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
Please give me some info.

172
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,480
I'll be linking to all these songs today.

173
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
And hey, how you doing?

174
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
I'm back from vacation.

175
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
I did it.

176
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,480
I completely unplugged a full week.

177
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Actually a little bit longer than that.

178
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,480
If you think about it, it was 11 days completely unplugged.

179
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Oh, man.

180
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
It was so nice.

181
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
The south of France.

182
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,480
Of course, I got to give you a little vacation wrap up.

183
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,480
And actually, upon returning,

184
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,480
I found that good old Ray, of course,

185
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,480
raised the subcontinent and a chuckle head,

186
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,480
who's been out there for quite a while for a number of years.

187
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,480
He actually kind of put together a little recap of where things are going,

188
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,480
some of the topics that we're going on,

189
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,480
and moves right into a commercial type of venture,

190
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,480
and a song from the soundtrack of my life.

191
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
I figured I'd play that for you.

192
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
And then we'll get into everything,

193
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,480
because there's a lot of meat on the bone today.

194
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,480
Oh, we want you tonight, Ray.

195
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Oh, we will you there, Adam.

196
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,480
Oh, we've got a meal, but I can't stop it.

197
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Sava.

198
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,480
And I wish it's right to soundtrack hell.

199
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,480
60km south west of the city of Nissan, the Mediterranean coast.

200
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
It's a French Riviera, man.

201
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Nice.

202
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
Or nice.

203
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Or Levant.

204
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
DuPance.

205
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,480
It's a dread-trabble land to celebrate your free days.

206
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,480
So, if you watched the two of the fronts,

207
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,480
actually I have no idea,

208
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,480
do the American people notice these hundred and eighty guys riding on a bike for three weeks.

209
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
All across France at all.

210
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,480
Do the Americans like cycling.

211
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,480
I mean, they've got Greg Lamont,

212
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,480
and actually became the first American cyclist to win the two of the fronts.

213
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
In 1986, when some strong,

214
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,480
he won the two of the fronts in a record-breaking seven consecutive years.

215
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,480
I mean, well, if you like to watch the best of the best,

216
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,480
the pizzas in the five, the two of the fronts is really the place to be.

217
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,480
And that's what you're looking at the sport, right, Adam?

218
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,480
To watch the best of the best, like soccer, the cup fever.

219
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,480
Cycling in a specially the two of the fronts is watching the best guys from all over the world,

220
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,480
riding the most exciting and the longest cycling that's all across France

221
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,480
with a big finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.

222
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,480
This year on Sunday, July the 27th.

223
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Good morning. This is your wake-up crew.

224
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,480
By the way, really exciting what you're doing on Aeroclassic Rockheadham

225
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
haven't got the time to listen every day,

226
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
but I've heard you shaking up the Hague,

227
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,480
the political capital offered the Netherlands.

228
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Way to go, dude.

229
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,480
You know, I've got a kind of job

230
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,480
where listening to a radio reaches a home at a level.

231
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
I made it.

232
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Believe me, I really tried to catch up with your podcast,

233
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,480
the wake-up call, but they're so long, man.

234
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
You know, when I'm listening to the DSC,

235
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,480
I know it's 45 minutes most of the time.

236
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,480
I can listen to my car during my 25 minutes drive to Amsterdam

237
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,480
and after nine hours of chasing bad guys,

238
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,480
I listen to the last part of the show.

239
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
It's nice. It sounds different.

240
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
I like the subjects,

241
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,480
and I just like the thought of being part of a greater area,

242
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,480
instead of being the pitch in the pie.

243
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
I like the chucklehead community,

244
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,480
and I think you're doing a great job on a Charlie.

245
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,480
So how about that DSC daily source-goat thing?

246
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,480
What's up with that?

247
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,480
I'm aware of the fact that there's a problem

248
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,480
with a daily part of this name,

249
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
but I don't care if you're shit.

250
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
I really don't have a problem with the fact

251
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
that you're not making a show every day of the week.

252
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
I am proud of things to do, you know?

253
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,480
So in my opinion, you can keep it this way,

254
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
but maybe the rest of the chuckleheads

255
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,480
want to rename the DSC in...

256
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Uh...

257
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Diviated source-goat,

258
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
dominant source-goat,

259
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
data source-goat,

260
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
compressed source-goat,

261
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
digital source-goat,

262
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
the hydrodynamic,

263
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
the democratic,

264
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
the drunken source-goat,

265
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
but maybe the delicious source-goat,

266
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
now let's do the drop-eye source-goat.

267
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
The deadly source-goat,

268
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
the dream of source-goat,

269
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
the deep source-goat,

270
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
how be my guest?

271
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,480
It never gets any better than the daily source-goat.

272
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
That's the name of the show, man.

273
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
So,

274
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
change the whole name,

275
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
something completely different,

276
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
or keep it going.

277
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,480
I'll let the chuckleheads help you.

278
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
So, Adam,

279
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
what do you think about this?

280
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
Soundtrack to my life.

281
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
I'm Gary.

282
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Soundtrack to my life.

283
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Let's take a look at the landscape on a road trip through your life.

284
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Adam Clark Curry was born on September 3,

285
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
in 1964,

286
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,480
in Arlington, Virginia,

287
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,480
and moved when it was eight months old

288
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
to Uganda,

289
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
in South Africa.

290
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,480
It was the year in which US President

291
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Lyndon Johnson declared a war on property

292
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
and Bob Dylan turns the Beatles

293
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,480
on to cannabis for the first time.

294
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,480
But there also was a Roy Kelton Arbison,

295
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
like many artists,

296
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
the big omen taint his success

297
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,480
as the British Invasion Sweat America in 1964.

298
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
His single,

299
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
how pretty woman broke the Beatles

300
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,480
strangled hold on the top 10

301
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
soaring to number one on the Billboard

302
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,480
charge and number one in the British charge.

303
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,480
The record sold war copies in the first ten days

304
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,480
of released an any single up to that time

305
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,480
and eventually sold over 7 million copies.

306
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,480
Adam Curry's soundtrack to my life

307
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,480
takes a trip down memory lane 2,

308
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,480
in 1964.

309
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
A top of the hour going to go home

310
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
and it's kind of curry.

311
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,480
A top of the hour going to go home

312
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
and it's kind of curry.

313
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
A top of the hour going to go home

314
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480
and it's kind of curry.

315
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
A top of the hour going to go home

316
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
and it's kind of curry.

317
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
A top of the hour going to go home

318
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
and it's kind of curry.

319
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
A top of the hour going to go home

320
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
and it's kind of curry.

321
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
A top of the hour going to go home

322
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
and it's kind of curry.

323
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
A top of the hour going to go home

324
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
and it's kind of curry.

325
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
a top of the hour going to go home

326
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
and it's kind of curry.

327
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
a top of the hour going to go home

328
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
and it's kind of curry.

329
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
a top of the hour going to go home

330
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
and it's kind of curry.

331
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
a top of the hour going to go home

332
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
and it's kind of curry.

333
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
a top of the hour going to go home

334
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
and it's kind of curry.

335
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
a top of the hour going to go home

336
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
and it's kind of curry.

337
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
a top of the hour going to go home

338
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
and it's kind of curry.

339
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480

00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
and it's kind of curry.

347
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480

348
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
and it's kind of curry.

a top of the hour going to go home

362
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
and it's kind of curry.

363
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
a top of the hour going to go home

364
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
and it's kind of curry.

365
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
a top of the hour going to go home

366
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
and it's kind of curry.

367
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,480
a top of the hour going to go home

368
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
and it's kind of curry.

369
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
a top of the hour going to go home

370
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
and it's kind of curry.

371
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
a top of the hour going to go home

372
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
and it's kind of curry.

373
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,480
a top of the hour going to go home

374
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
and it's kind of curry.

375
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
a top of the hour going to go home

376
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
and it's kind of curry.

377
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:42,480
a top of the hour going to go home

378
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,480
okay

379
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,480
a bottom of the day

380
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,480
a top of the night

381
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:02,480
The man must be the big ol' Roy Arbison, all pretty woman and big hit in 1964.

382
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,480
The year our friend was dropped on this planet.

383
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,480
So Adam, what was your family situation back in 64?

384
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
What kind of house were you living?

385
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
What kind of job was your father doing?

386
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,480
Do you remember anything of these early years of your life in the US?

387
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,480
I did you move to South Africa.

388
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,480
I would go through the soundtrack to your life.

389
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
And for now take care.

390
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,480
And if you like it, I'll be back next week with a soundtrack to your life from 1986.

391
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Alright, Ray, on the Charlie, my brother, thank you so much.

392
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
I love that.

393
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
Absolutely spectacular.

394
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
A wrap-up of everything.

395
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
Now you're done.

396
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Now you're up to speed.

397
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Now you know what's going on.

398
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Besides the fact, of course, that I'm going to tell you about

399
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,480
the vacation in the south of France.

400
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
I've just decided to say France now from now on.

401
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,480
That's my first British pronunciation that I'm bringing into my vocabulary.

402
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Because when I say France, it sounds so American.

403
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
And people look at me funny.

404
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,480
But of course, it's Americans who say, oh, you say France.

405
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
So that's kind of funny.

406
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,480
Anyway, so we were visiting.

407
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,480
We did something we've never done before.

408
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
We stayed with a friend.

409
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
He invited us to stay at his house.

410
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,480
By the way, many panelists, I might say.

411
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,480
So our buddy, Michelle, he owns the largest nightclub in Syria, I think,

412
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,480
which happens to be in Guilford.

413
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,480
And we met up with him at the BT Pod Show Christmas party.

414
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,480
He crashed the party with a super agent Keith, who, of course,

415
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,480
we've been working with for over a year.

416
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
And that was the introduction.

417
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
And we really got on well.

418
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,480
And he said, you know, once you guys come down, hang out.

419
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
He's divorced.

420
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
Sorry.

421
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,480
He's not married to his daughter's mother.

422
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,480
It's how's that for political correctness, huh?

423
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,480
So she's 12 or 13, her name is Nicole.

424
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,480
And she was going to be down there.

425
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,480
So kind of like a sibling vibe for Christina.

426
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
And he had some other house guess over again.

427
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,480
You know, like a mini palace with a huge Olympic size swimming pool.

428
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
He did nicely to 28 degrees centigrade.

429
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
I mean, it doesn't get any better than that.

430
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
We had 30 degrees outside.

431
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,480
Right on in San Rafael right near the sea right near the harbor.

432
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,480
We rented a 40 foot power boat one day.

433
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,480
And we zipped across to San Trope, which is about a 20 minute.

434
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,480
Well, I don't want to say a flight because this thing was going so fast.

435
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,480
Of course, we also had a captain to steer the boat for us.

436
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,480
Head lunch at the famous club sank on sank club 55 right there on next to Nikki Beach.

437
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,480
I mean, we were, I mean, this is kind of place where PDD shows up with his helicopter.

438
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,480
In fact, it was kind of funny that my partner Ron Bloom was in that same.

439
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,480
And we probably were no more than 10 kilometers or part for the space of about a day and a half.

440
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,480
As he decided last minute to go out to San Trope as well.

441
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,480
And so, you know, he just kind of hung around on July 14, which is kind of the French independence day,

442
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
but steel day.

443
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,480
We were invited by someone Patricia knows to a rooftop celebration with a party on the rooftop.

444
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,480
And a view of the fireworks. And boy, when we got there, I mean, this thing was right next to the Carlton Hotel,

445
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,480
probably one of the most expensive real estate spots in the world.

446
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,480
And it was like an enormous penthouse deck with, I don't know,

447
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,480
there must have been 70 people on the deck.

448
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,480
I mean, it was just outrageous.

449
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,480
And I complete view of the water of the bay and that the fireworks display.

450
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,480
And it was a real posh posh.

451
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
She, she type of vacation. It was great.

452
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,480
And our host was very gracious.

453
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
He was almost like a Julie from the love boat.

454
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,480
You know, like a cruise director taking us somewhere every single day.

455
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,480
And because normally, you know, we just kind of like veg out and do nothing.

456
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
And hang by the pool, no more bored within three days.

457
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,480
So there was not a moment of boringness to be found.

458
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,480
And I got to tell you, I really like the south of France.

459
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,480
They had vegetables.

460
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
And fruit that actually look like vegetables of fruit because, of course,

461
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
they're not genetically modified.

462
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
Boy, what a surprise there.

463
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
And the food was just delicious.

464
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
And now I don't know.

465
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
My French even started to come back.

466
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
I was actually quite pleased with myself.

467
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,480
And in general, I have to say, I very much look like going back there.

468
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,480
It's not quite as hot as Portugal or Spain or some parts of southern Italy.

469
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,480
The weather in general is really nice.

470
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
It's just a, it's great.

471
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
And I can fly there with a delta share.

472
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,480
Not that we did that, of course, because the ladies would never fly for three and a half hours with me,

473
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,480
which is about what it would take depending on the road weather and the wind conditions.

474
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,480
But, no, good.

475
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
You know, I think we'll go back for sure.

476
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,480
Now, upon my return, we got back late last Friday night.

477
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,480
And Saturday, you know, it's still kind of a time.

478
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Even though once only one hour as we still had a little bit of a time difference.

479
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,480
And I was like, I'm got to go get myself a 3G iPhone.

480
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,480
I actually tried on Friday posted a picture on curry.com.

481
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,480
901 Friday morning when they went on sale worldwide.

482
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,480
There was a hundred people outside the O2 store in Guilford, no less,

483
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
which really blew me away.

484
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
So, of course, I didn't buy one.

485
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
I didn't even look for one in France.

486
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,480
In fact, I stayed pretty much disconnected and only read the financial times every single day,

487
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,480
which we'll get to that later because a lot of shit that I was reading that I don't like.

488
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,480
And a lot of things really opened up in my mind.

489
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,480
More awakening, I would say, more red pill stuff.

490
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,480
So, and now, of course, I'd also been reading about the launch in the FT,

491
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,480
and Patricia had her daily mirror, whatever, and there was a couple other papers laying around.

492
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
But mainly in the FT.

493
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,480
And, you know, I started to notice a couple of trends.

494
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,480
Like, well, of course, the built-in GPS isn't all that hot, it turns out.

495
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Of course, there's no turn-by-turn directions, at least not with a voice, like a proper navigation system.

496
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,480
I guess that's forthcoming.

497
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Of course, a lot of noise about the app store.

498
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,480
What else was there? Oh, battery life, still pretty limited for hours.

499
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,480
If you've got everything blowing full speed, you know, that kind of stuff that's a little bit irritating.

500
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,480
And so, I came up with an alternative plan.

501
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,480
First thing I did is I upgraded my iPod Touch, which, of course, is exactly the iPhone,

502
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,480
only without the phone and the 3G part.

503
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,480
It's got Wi-Fi and everything else is pretty much the same.

504
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,480
Oh, it also doesn't have a camera.

505
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,480
But, you know, I've been using my Nokia E61I for that, which has been okay.

506
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,480
It's the same quality camera that's in the iPhone, including the 3G version.

507
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,480
And, I should revisit that joy-coost spot.

508
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:57,480
Because that essentially can turn your Nokia or any other Symbian-based phone into a Wi-Fi access point using your high-speed 3G.

509
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:08,480
And, of course, here we have HDSPA, which is a high density maybe, something packet access.

510
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,480
I don't know.

511
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,480
Emily, it's HSDPA, I don't know.

512
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,480
High-speed, it's HSDPA, high-speed digital packet access.

513
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,480
I think that's what it's called, which can get you up to, they say 3.6 megabits per second.

514
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,480
But, in general, I see it probably happening around 700 kilobits per second.

515
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:35,480
It's not quite a megabit, but still way faster than whatever I've seen coming out of, you know, a traditional 3G.

516
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,480
I think is what they call it.

517
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,480
And, I got a message from Candyman, Luke, and he said, hey, you know, did you ever receive that E71?

518
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,480
Because I guess they were going to send me the new Nokia phone, which I hadn't received.

519
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
And I said, yeah, don't worry about it.

520
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
You know, I'm getting the iPhone.

521
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,480
So, it already said, please don't send me anything.

522
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:00,480
It calls for a kind of field of blides if they do send me something to, you know, go out and tell people about it.

523
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,480
But I was kind of reading up on it.

524
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:14,480
And so, I, you know, I would basically say, thought to myself, well, look, now I'm running the, all of the iPhone iPod Touch 2.0 software.

525
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
I've looked at the app store.

526
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,480
And there's some interesting things in there.

527
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,480
In fact, if I pick it up right now, let me see what apps do I have installed.

528
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
I've got flashlight.

529
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
I love that.

530
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,480
So, I, and in fact, I use that quite a bit using the screen with high density light as a flashlight.

531
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:41,480
VNC, I've got the aviation software for flight, which is like 65 bucks, but very cool for getting up to the minute information.

532
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:50,480
I've got Bloomberg installed Twitter-rific for Twitter weather bug near times and the remote, which lets you control iTunes via remote.

533
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
So, that's all pretty handy stuff.

534
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
It's pretty cool.

535
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
It's a zippy.

536
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,480
And I enjoy it.

537
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,480
There's nothing like browsing the web on the iPod Touch on the iPhone.

538
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
That without a doubt, hands down.

539
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
It beats everything.

540
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,480
The size of the screen, the interaction with the fingers, the tapping, love it, nothing compares.

541
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
No matter what.

542
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,480
So, I figured I'd go into the city and I'd look around.

543
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,480
And, you know, I stood in front of the O2 store and already heard that, you know, they were probably sold out.

544
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
And right behind me was a Nokia store.

545
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,480
So, I said, you know, maybe I go look at that communicator that E90 or whatever it is.

546
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,480
I'm just looking for something that can run Joy-Coost spot at this point as kind of an alternative.

547
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,480
That will let me browse at high speed connecting basically the iPod Touch to a phone.

548
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,480
And this thing is kind of plastic and kind of big looking.

549
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,480
But next to it, they had a singular one single model of the E71.

550
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
And I was surprised.

551
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,480
Like, wow, this thing is beautiful.

552
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,480
I mean, it's the first Nokia phone that actually looks high-class upper-scale,

553
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,480
the classy, just beautiful.

554
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
And that's the guy turned it on for me.

555
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
And I'm amazed at the speed of this thing.

556
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
And it's got a GPS built in with turn by turn.

557
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,480
Voice instructions.

558
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,480
It's got a 3.2 megapixel camera.

559
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
It's got all kinds of extra goodies.

560
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,480
And really, the biggest problem I've had with my Nokia E61 eye,

561
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,480
which I like very much, particularly with the full size.

562
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Full query keyboard.

563
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,480
It's just that the process was a little bit too slow.

564
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,480
And this one, the E71, I think, has a 400 megahertz processor.

565
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
And this shit is just flying.

566
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,480
And I'm amazed.

567
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,480
I mean, the internet telephone works without buffering and, you know,

568
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,480
cropping out merely because the processor can just handle it.

569
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
So I'm like, okay, that's it.

570
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
So I bought it.

571
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,480
Not cheap, by the way, to get an unlocked version like 350 pounds.

572
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,480
And I have been totally in love ever since.

573
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
This thing is amazing.

574
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
Even the web browsing isn't too bad because of its speed.

575
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
I mean, it's just so incredibly fast.

576
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,480
But really, running it with joy coospot and the iPod touch is a phenomenal combination.

577
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
But this thing is so cool.

578
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
It even has a little business card scanner.

579
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,480
You take a picture of the business card with the built in camera.

580
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,480
And it OCRs it optical character recognition.

581
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,480
And then you can add it straight to your address book, all the details.

582
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
And I tried it on my own card.

583
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
And it really works.

584
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,480
It's outrageous.

585
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
And so I'm still getting used to it.

586
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Figuring everything out and loaded up some cool symbioness.

587
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,480
And I must say, I must say it is now that they've got the speed of this thing up.

588
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
It's great.

589
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,480
And of course, you get like your five hours continuous talk time,

590
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
14 days stand by time.

591
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,480
I mean, you know, real proper technology in there.

592
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,480
So I think I found a beautiful, beautiful combination.

593
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,480
And as we progress through the use of it, I'll let you know how I get on.

594
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
But I'm so far, so good.

595
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,480
I'm very, very happy with what I'm seeing.

596
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,480
Now, since it is vacation time and since I am very proud that we've got this big name

597
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
sponsor on the show.

598
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
I just want to talk about budget rent to cars.

599
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,480
By the way, with today's oil prices, which I'm sure we're going to talk about later.

600
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,480
I mean, why the hell would you have a card?

601
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
You know, if you really need one, just rent it.

602
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,480
And if you want good looking cars, and I know this from my own experience, particularly

603
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,480
budget on sunset in California in Los Angeles, he's got cool looking cars as well.

604
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
Even though they're, they're called budget.

605
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,480
They got hot wheels.

606
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,480
So I've got a special discount for you.

607
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,480

613
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,480
There's a couple more that aren't running so well that I want to find out from you guys.

614
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,480
Why not? We'll talk about that later on in the show as well.

615
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,480
So big boy service without the big boy upgrades.

616
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,480
There you go rent like a genius budget.com slash DSC.

617
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,480
Again, sourcing music from the, from the drop drop.io slash daily source code.

618
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:14,480
This one is actually a little bit more noted on this one in the, in the upload.

619
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Akira the Don, a very appropriate is we're talking about what's going on with the oil prices.

620
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
And of course, they've dropped significantly.

621
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,480
Oh, not that speculators have anything to do with it.

622
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,480
Oh, no, when a drop is just what?

623
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,480
Supplying demand reversing all of a sudden, please give me a break.

624
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
Don't talk about that.

625
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
Prepare to listen to the bankers.

626
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Just.

627
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
Just.

628
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
Just.

629
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Just.

630
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Just.

631
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Just.

632
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,480
Just.

633
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Just.

634
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,480
Just.

635
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
Just.

636
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,240
I would see in the whole world, and he can't take his life

637
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Fuck, say that dude was spasin' out on PCP

638
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,680
A son and coke and a food

639
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,360
I'm like, I really well, and I show that shit on the news

640
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,800
Whether they choose it's only show the one side

641
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,040
They got the people outside right in

642
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,800
Coppers on childhood, and she's right

643
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,720
They need you give a fuck about blacks

644
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,160
She just didn't make sense

645
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,520
These are questions I ask

646
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,920
Then I'm on the sole layer, a click and links on

647
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,360
Jason's looks at

648
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,000
Concert answers are fine food

649
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And Nixon instigated institution

650
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,040
That has the part

651
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,640
This is banned to US Constitution

652
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,000
And they banned a very crisis

653
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,600
Such as, you know, all the national opposition to the US invasion

654
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,440
Of course, as they can stop martial law

655
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,600
If there's right, and in several US safe

656
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,000
Semotainously, I was like, oh yeah

657
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,600
I see nothing at home, just in town

658
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,400
It's like black

659
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
They get fake news and the cause of it now

660
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,440
It's black, you know

661
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,800
They get fake news and the cause of it

662
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,000
It's like black

663
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,800
They get fake news

664
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,000
It's like black, you know

665
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,800
It's black, you know

666
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,400
They get the cause of it now

667
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,600
They get fake news and the cause of it now

668
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
They get fake news and the cause of it now

669
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
They get fake news and the cause of it now

670
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
They get fake news and the cause of it now

671
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,800
The population are just fit for a reason

672
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,120
Carrow should have been home for treason

673
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,440
We buy strawberries at a season like babes

674
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,200
Oh, so when you're up, you thought

675
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,800
You don't stop, you buy cuffs

676
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,400
Then it's out to the next thing

677
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,320
Settlement to sex, strings, and flime

678
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,400
The last case, and when the work

679
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,320
Cakes, a king, make us quick

680
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,320
Catflakes should get shelter

681
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,720
He gets cracklakes with crashes

682
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,920
Have a fina around me

683
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,520
Then he's got the money

684
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,120
Settlement to sex, and the star

685
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,880
It's some of the guys in the club

686
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,400
The guys above them are the guys

687
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,360
Blaine on their club

688
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,880
The guys, fuck them are the guys

689
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,840
Call that ice cream

690
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,760
Guys, my sweat's like dead guys

691
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,080
Most success, they're just disguised

692
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,280
Settlement to sex

693
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,560

J loyal中国

728
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,520
And to hell and I've heard

729
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,920
Well organized in the ranks

730
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,420
I thought we were the fact

731
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,420
The world back we should gather with tax

732
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,380
All they do is fuck

733
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,720
I can't miss it much juggly

734
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,920
If someone wanted you to land back

735
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,820
Five times back control they promised you

736
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,320
They were your education

737
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,120
The borders right there and right there for us

738
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,020
Cause they beat the car

739
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,220
For its paypal

740
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,720
These lungs are maybe that's like

741
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,920
Oh, you wanna fuck you

742
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,220
If you're only in your home

743
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,720
You just hours are keeping every kind of credit cards

744
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,820
Like what's that?

745
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,320
Come snatch it back pretend you think you are all exactly what you choose

746
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,220
Remember where they go

747
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,220
Cause now the chips ring

748
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,720
I'm supposed to be going to you

749
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,720
A cure of the dawn

750
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,020
It's the bankers man

751
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,020
I'm telling you it's them dirty bankers

752
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,020
I'm not talking about you

753
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,520
You're a local city bank or your bank of America

754
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,620
You know as some kind of like ATM based business

755
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,620
I'm talking about

756
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,220
The big guys

757
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,420
The guys at the top names like Rockefeller, Rothschild, Warburg

758
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,720
Those are the ones you got to look out for my friends

759
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,020
And particularly this oil thing man

760
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,020
This is someone just pulling the levers

761
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,420
Just trying to make it all work

762
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,220
Cause we're gonna right now we've got inflation

763
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,620
And we've got an economy that's stagnating

764
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,220
Right?

765
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,820
This is happening across the globe

766
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,020
You're seeing banks that are almost going out of business

767
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,520
Wait

768
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,020
I mean look at this

769
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,220
Look it's so simple to see what's happening

770
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,220
Europeans raise their interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.25%

771
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,220
That means of course the dollar has to change

772
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,720
But you know how do we combat that?

773
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Well let's just pull the lever on the oil

774
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,720
Down it went

775
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,220
Down almost 15 bucks a barrel of oil

776
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,220
How coincidental by the way

777
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,220
That it stopped around 130 dipped a little bit below

778
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,720
I'll tell you why

779
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,220
There was an enormous amount of option put options contracts at 130

780
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,220
This means someone is betting against the price

781
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,220
The price will be going down

782
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,220
And if it hits 130 that's where they start to make the big money

783
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,220
If it goes even lower that's where they start to make a real spread

784
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,220
That's the reason it dipped down to 129

785
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,220
No other reason the demand in all of a sudden stop

786
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,220
Not that much

787
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,220
Oh yes sure there were some reports

788
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,220
But I'm telling you it's crap

789
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,220
It's all crap

790
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,220
Yeah let's listen to it today

791
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,220
Today's the 21st of July

792
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,220
Let's listen to a CNN news update

793
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,220
And let's see if we can dissect what's happening here

794
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,220
Listen to this crap

795
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,220
A wobbly economy has made many Americans pinch pennies

796
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,220
A little tighter

797
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,220
CNN's John Lawrence has details

798
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,220
That's not a journalist say high fuel prices

799
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
A rough housing market and other concerns

800
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,220
Have caused many consumers to hold on to their wall

801
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,220
It's a little bit tighter than usual

802
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,220
It's not holding on

803
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,220
It's hanging on because we're getting screwed

804
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,220
It's not like the gas pumps have dropped the price

805
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,220
In fact they're probably going to go up a little bit before they come down

806
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,220
You mark my words on this

807
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,220
We're losing wealth

808
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
We have to learn to get that

809
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:18,220
We're losing wealth because the federal reserve is now handing out billions of

810
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,220
Dollars for free in loans

811
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,220
Which means they're you know printing money

812
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,220
Not really printing and it's just a computer database entry

813
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,220
But it shows up in all the systems

814
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,220
It is a global finance system you know

815
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,220
So that means our money is becoming

816
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,220
Worth less

817
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,220
It's exactly what we have to do

818
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,220
Robert Brusko with fact in opinion economics

819
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,220
Is it might take a while for the country to bounce back

820
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,220
I think that one of the problems is that people talk about this task

821
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,220
Period like it spends so bad

822
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,220
And my concern is that the worst may still lie ahead of us

823
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,220
Yeah, there you go

824
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,220
I agree with that as well

825
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,220
I think we're in inning four

826
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,220
And it's probably going to be a ten inning game

827
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:02,220
A recent survey from Nielsen coast is 63% of Americans have cut their spending over the past 12 months

828
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,220
Joe, wow, do you hear how that shit's edited man?

829
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,220
What a puking voice that is

830
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,220
John Lawrence

831
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,220
Yeah, yeah

832
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:14,220
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson says he wants to have a safe and sound banking system

833
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,220
A safe and sound banking system

834
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,220
There is no cause for concern

835
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,220
Please return to your homes

836
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,220
Act normal and purchase through amazon.com

837
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,220
Watch television and buy stuff

838
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,220
In the 75 years we've had the FDIC

839
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,220
We have not had a single deposit or lose one penny

840
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,220
Yeah, this is ensuring your money in the bank

841
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
I'm worried about that man

842
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,220
I'm spreading my shit out

843
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,220
I don't want all my money in one bank

844
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,220
Even the fortest bank

845
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,220
Which I also bank with

846
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,220
In Europe is having troubles, man

847
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,220
You know, and they only secure so much

848
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,220
Take it out, put it into something else by some oil

849
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,220
However, Paulson tells CNN's late edition

850
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,220
The number of troubled banks will increase

851
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,220
As they cope to struggle with big losses on bad mortgages

852
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,220
Yeah, duh

853
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,220
More housing data on tap this week

854
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,220
A report regarding

855
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,220
Your house is now worthless

856
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,220
Previously owned homes sales will be released on Thursday

857
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,220
But let me just explain one thing

858
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,220
Let me try this because this becomes so abundantly clear to me

859
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,220
How these banks operate? What a scam

860
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,220
So if someone puts like a hundred thousand dollars

861
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,220
The posits that in their bank

862
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,220
That could be me by the way

863
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,220
By law they're allowed to multiply that by ten

864
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,220
And lend it out

865
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,220
So it's fake money

866
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,220
It doesn't exist

867
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,220
Because they're not actually handing you a check

868
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,220
If you go get a mortgage for a hundred thousand dollars on a house

869
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,220
No, they just put a little checkmark

870
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,220
And minus a hundred thousand in your account

871
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,220
In your cell on the spreadsheet

872
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,220
And they add it to another person

873
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,220
Is that like a hundred thousand dollars in printed money

874
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,220
Or gold transferred hands

875
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,220
It's like a check, it's a piece of paper

876
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,220
And that they created out of thin air

877
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,220
Do you understand?

878
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,220
So you worked really hard

879
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,220
I put a hundred grand in there

880
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,220
Which even though it's paper

881
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,220
I did it with actual work

882
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,220
And then they get to lend that nine more times

883
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,220
And that money is just fake

884
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,220
It's not real

885
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,220
So when someone can't pay back the loan

886
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,220
That's when they start to scrap it in the real wealth

887
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,220
You know you work hard for that

888
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,220
It's a house

889
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,220
A house is really worth something

890
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,220
And then that way they can just go ahead and steal from everybody

891
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,220
It's become so abundantly clear to me

892
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,220
And it's just so incredibly wrong

893
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,220
Well we gotta do something about it

894
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,220
I might have some ideas later on

895
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,220
By the way, this one kind of lost in the shuffle

896
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,220
It's been hanging in the queue for a couple of weeks

897
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,220
It is our European correspondent

898
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,220
Our sabond known as comic strip blogger

899
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,220
Some about France

900
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,220
So let's see what he's got in store for us today

901
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,220
Hello

902
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,220
Adam Lekiri

903
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,220
Hello

904
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,220
He was here, you're again, you're a correspondent

905
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,220
He has been

906
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,220
Yes

907
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,220
So let this news is that

908
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,220
Members of EU Parliament called MEPs

909
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,220
I'll get to think now

910
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:05,220
New shiny TV train

911
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,220
That's one of those high speed trains

912
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,220
The commute between the Brussels and Strasbourg

913
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,220
Yeah, this is crazy man

914
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,220
The European Parliament

915
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,220
I think the French got all bent out of shape

916
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,220
And they wanted to have

917
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,220
They wanted to have the European Parliament

918
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,220
What's this?

919
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,220
No, no, no, go away

920
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,220
One to have the European Parliament

921
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,220
Near their hometown

922
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,220
And so we wound up with two

923
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,220
We're including Brussels

924
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,220
And so they shut all back and forth

925
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
Like every week or every month

926
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,220
Of God knows

927
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,220
There's such a waste of money

928
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,220
And it's a good opportunity to

929
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,220
Reminds to everybody

930
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,220
That is squandering of money

931
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,220
By having two locations for EU Parliament

932
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,220
It's a fault of France

933
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,220
100% fault of France

934
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,220
All the France

935
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,220
That despite the petition of over one million EU citizens

936
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,220
I repeat one million EU citizens

937
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,220
Side petition against it

938
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,220
But France still insists on keeping this location in Strasbourg

939
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,220
In France even it is not used very much

940
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,220
So clearly France is much much worse

941
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,220
For European Union than Ireland

942
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah

943
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,220
I'm totally there with you man

944
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,220
In fact, Sarcosi

945
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,220
President of the European Union for the next six months

946
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,220
And of course, a main man in France

947
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,220
He's in the Ireland today

948
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,220
And you know what he's doing

949
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,220
And this has really pissed me off

950
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,220
Because I've been reading it

951
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,220
I've been tracking it all week long

952
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,220
It's like they're just not going to accept this no vote

953
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,220
On the Lisbon Treaty

954
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,220
Which of course really is a fundamental change

955
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,220
In our fundamental inalienable rights

956
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,220
Because it is a constitution

957
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,220
I've read it

958
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,220
No one can dispute what these protocols

959
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,220
And amendments are

960
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,220
The treated as law

961
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,220
And all of the member states that ratified this

962
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,220
It's law

963
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,220
And I don't like it

964
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,220
And we've discussed it and we've read it

965
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,220
And there's a lot of really weird shit in these laws

966
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,220
You know, yeah, you have the freedom

967
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,220
To of movement and just freedom as an individual

968
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,220
Unless of course you have a communicable disease

969
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,220
Or if you're a vagrant

970
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,220
Then you'll be arrested

971
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,220
Death penalty no

972
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,220
Unless you're trying to escape a rest

973
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,220
Well, that's no reason to kill anybody

974
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,220
And that shit's going into law

975
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,220
And they're pushing it through

976
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,220
They will not accept the no

977
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,220
So now there's basically only a couple of options

978
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,220
One that people are talking about is a two-speed Europe

979
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,220
Where countries who don't ratify

980
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,220
Ireland of course is the only official one

981
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,220
And then there's a five more couple of them

982
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,220
Could be on the fence

983
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,220
I don't know by the way

984
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,220
Did that

985
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,220
Get ratified in the UK

986
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,220
Is that lawsuit get resolved by that one guy

987
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,220
Who was suing the government

988
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,220
If you know, let me know, please

989
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,220
So anyway, countries that don't ratify

990
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,220
They would still be operating on the niece treaty

991
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,220
It's ridiculous

992
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,220
This is how desperate they are to get this done

993
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,220
And I'm seeing laws show up now

994
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,220
I'm seeing shit happening in Europe that is wrong

995
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,220
The first one is double jeopardy

996
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,220
Now double jeopardy

997
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,220
Of course it's a exciting round in the game show

998
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,220
But it essentially means that if you are

999
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,220
If you're charged and you go to trial

1000
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,220
And you're not convicted, you cannot be tried for the same crime again

1001
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,220
So this is like the OJ Simpson

1002
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,220
Which of course is a perfectly example

1003
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,220
That not being an unfortunate law

1004
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,220
So I think we pretty much know he killed his ex-wife

1005
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,220
And Ron Goldman, her lover or friend or whatever

1006
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,220
Of course, we don't know that for sure

1007
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,220
But it sure seems like in fact in the civil suit he was found guilty

1008
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,220
But in the federal suit, not guilty

1009
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,220
So we can never be tried for that again

1010
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,220
Even if they have pictures of him actually killing them

1011
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,220
Now this of course is sad

1012
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,220
Because here's a guy who gets away

1013
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,220
Literally with murder as far as I'm concerned

1014
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,220
No proof of that

1015
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,220
Even wrote a book

1016
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,220
If I was going to do it here's how I do it

1017
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,220
G-O-J thanks for that

1018
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,220
Of course even throwing the guy in jail

1019
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,220
Even putting him on death row

1020
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,220
Nothing will get the coal Simpson and Ron Goldman back

1021
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,220
Which that's obvious

1022
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,220
But really this law is very important

1023
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,220
Because you don't want the government

1024
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,220
Hounding you

1025
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,220
Because if there was no double jeopardy

1026
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,220
Then let's say here's one

1027
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,220
That I've actually had happened to me in the Netherlands

1028
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:35,220
Where double jeopardy is about to be dismissed

1029
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,220
The internal revenue

1030
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,220
They said oh you owe us like a million dollars

1031
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,220
And I said no I don't

1032
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,220
And in fact even did some nasty shit

1033
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,220
And went to the press and it became a big hoopla

1034
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,220
And later the judge said

1035
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,220
You know what? You don't know anything

1036
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,220
In fact they owe you a public apology

1037
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,220
Which they had to do

1038
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,220
Now

1039
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,220
Let's say

1040
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,220
This double jeopardy is gone

1041
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,220
Somewhere down the line they could easily say

1042
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,220
Well we got some new evidence man

1043
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,220
We got a picture if you do a stop

1044
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,220
Man they could just start up a whole process again

1045
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,220
And again and again and they can wear you down

1046
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,220
Law suits are not fun

1047
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,220
Courts are not fun

1048
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,220
And they could use this to mess with you

1049
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,220
Now we're already enslaved in so many ways

1050
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,220
Now this is this is bad

1051
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,220
It really is bad

1052
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,220
There's a reason for this law and it's to protect our rights

1053
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,220
So across Europe this is now being phased out

1054
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,220
In Ireland in the Netherlands

1055
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,220
In fact they even think Australia is considering removing this

1056
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,220
So this clearly larger forces at work with an agenda

1057
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,220
And they're smart about it

1058
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,220
Okay, so I'm again

1059
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,220
Europe as a free trade zone

1060
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,220
Which of course is what the European Union started as the European economic community

1061
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,220
The EEC

1062
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,220
Now it has to be like the United States of Europe

1063
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,220
And now I'm against it man

1064
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,220
This is wrong

1065
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,220
This is really wrong

1066
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,220
And I don't trust these guys anymore

1067
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,220
I certainly don't trust our cozy

1068
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,220
Man this guy just look at him

1069
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,220
Just look at him

1070
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,220
You can't trust a guy like that

1071
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,220
Oh man

1072
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,220
Hey um

1073
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,220
There's a very cool let me see if I can find it here

1074
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,220
Um

1075
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,220
I'm missing something

1076
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,220
Oh wait a minute

1077
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,220
Before I even get to that

1078
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,220
I gotta tell you

1079
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,220
I've been invited to a host and event

1080
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,220
And I'm gonna do it

1081
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,220
And I'm really really psyched about this

1082
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,220
Doctor Ron Paul

1083
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,220
Is throwing something titled

1084
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,220
The Rally for the Republic

1085
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,220
And this will be held simultaneously

1086
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,220
In the same week as

1087
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,220
The Republican National Convention

1088
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,220
Which will be held in Minneapolis

1089
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,220
So this is also taking place in Minneapolis

1090
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,220
And I don't

1091
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,220
It's a big venue

1092
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,220
It's like 15,000 people

1093
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,220
And there's lots of music stars

1094
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,220
Of course Dr. Ron is gonna do a speech

1095
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,220
And it's uh

1096
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,220
Well here's the actually I have this bit for you

1097
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,220
The website is not yet

1098
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,220
Rally goals and issues

1099
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,220
Americans inherit from their ancestors

1100
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,220
A glorious tradition of freedom and resistance to oppression

1101
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,220
Our country is long been admired

1102
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,220
By the rest of the world for a great example of liberty and prosperity

1103
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,220
A light shining in the darkness of tyranny

1104
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,220
Join the revolution

1105
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,220
The hell does that

1106
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,220
Hold on a second

1107
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,220
Hold on a second

1108
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,220
I'm sure you're not hearing this

1109
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,220
Okay, that's coming through

1110
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,220
Ah, crap

1111
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,220
Let me get back to that

1112
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,220
So tomorrow the website goes live

1113
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,220
It's Rally for the Republic dot com

1114
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,220
But right now you can

1115
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:36,220
It's not up yet so you'll probably be redirected to the campaign for

1116
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,220
Liberty dot com

1117
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,220
So anyway so on the second they have this 15,000 person event

1118
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,220
Then on the first they basically have

1119
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,220
I mean I would almost say it's tailor-made for chuckleheads

1120
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:48,220
They have they've gotten a football stadium

1121
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,220
And that's where all the people who believe

1122
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,220
There's reptilians the UFOs are coming

1123
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,220
The tinfoil hatwares

1124
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,220
The conspiracy theorists

1125
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,220
But also Amy Allen

1126
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,220
And we're working on some other really cool artists

1127
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,220
They're all going to have their own special event

1128
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,220
Which is kind of the hard core to kick it all off

1129
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,220
In fact that is the core base of Dr. Ron

1130
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,220
I love that

1131
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,220
And I'll be hosting that event

1132
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,220
September 1st in Minneapolis

1133
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,220
I'm really really psyched about it

1134
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,220
So I'll be telling you more about that as it goes long

1135
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,220
And maybe we could even do a meetup

1136
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,220
With a bunch of a bunch of chuckleheads

1137
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:22,220
Which I think would just be extremely cool

1138
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,220
Now quick note about Drobot

1139
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:28,220
This is this hard disk that never runs out of space

1140
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,220
Which we've got an amazing deal on

1141
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,220
But I haven't you know not a single chucklehead

1142
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,220
Is purchased one and I'm wondering if you guys don't like it

1143
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:38,220
If it's if it's just not you know if it's just not floating

1144
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,220
Your boat if it's not

1145
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:45,220
Taking on the boxes because we have a fifty dollars off the Drobot basic unit

1146
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:50,220
And fifty dollars off the Drobot unit which which come bundled

1147
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,220
It comes bundled with a two terabyte or four terabyte drive

1148
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,220
All you got to do is go to drobot.com slash dsc

1149
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,220
And you can get that fifty dollar off

1150
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,220
But no one has purchased one

1151
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,220
I know I've mentioned a couple of times on the show

1152
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,220
And I'm just wondering if you're not interested

1153
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,220
Then I'll just stop

1154
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,220
If you have questions about it

1155
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,220
There's a cool video on CNET

1156
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,220
I know Cali Lewis has been talking about this thing as well

1157
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,220
But I'll put a link in the show notes to this CNET video

1158
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,220
Because as well we'll take a look at this thing

1159
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,220
It is awesome

1160
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,220
And I have one on order myself

1161
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,220
It's going to the condo in San Francisco

1162
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,220
Just to save on shipping

1163
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,220
So I'll bring that back with me

1164
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,220
I think I'm going to go in a week or two

1165
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,220
So keep you up the speed on that

1166
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,220
Let me see

1167
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,220
Man I have so much to talk about in so little time

1168
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,220
And I haven't even done any voicemail comments

1169
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,220
There was probably about

1170
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,220
I don't know

1171
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,220
120 of them

1172
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,220
Then I'm going through painfully one by one

1173
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:49,220
So look for if you say something cool

1174
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,220
And then look for that

1175
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,220
Coming up in the next week or so

1176
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,220
Let me see

1177
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,220
There's so much other stuff to talk about

1178
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,220
Yeah I think really just my total awareness

1179
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,220
And awakening of what's happening in the world

1180
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,220
And actually I also took a couple of books along with

1181
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:12,220
What was the one I liked a lot

1182
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,220
Oh I bought a shock doctrine

1183
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,220
I know me client

1184
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,220
I've talked about her on the show before

1185
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,220
There was a video that she kind of discussed this book

1186
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,220
And so I finally had some time to read it

1187
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:25,220
And it's really interesting because it gave me a lot of clues

1188
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,220
A lot of code words to look for

1189
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,220
Particularly that shows up in in print

1190
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:35,220
And really the understanding of how shock works

1191
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,220
And you'd see this word shock a lot these days

1192
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,220
Remember this really is a type of code

1193
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,220
Excuse me

1194
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,220
I just thought of it and say

1195
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,220
What happens is

1196
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,220
When either

1197
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,220
The shock is either put in place deliberately

1198
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,220
Think possibly 911

1199
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,220
Or think oil prices rising

1200
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,220
Astronomically all of a sudden

1201
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,220
In fact that is literally in the press called

1202
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:02,220
The oil shock or another shock based on oil

1203
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,220
When that shock hits and of course it hits our wallets

1204
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,220
It hits our heads were confused

1205
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,220
We're freaking out

1206
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,220
That's when all kinds of shit starts to change

1207
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,220
That's when you're going to watch out

1208
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,220
That's when stuff like the codex

1209
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,220
Alimentarius sneaks in

1210
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,220
We're all of a sudden now

1211
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:18,220
There's rules on what a tomato can look like

1212
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,220
Remember that we talked about that one last week

1213
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,220
Only four types of tomatoes

1214
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,220
Please do not deviate from the tomato blueprint anymore

1215
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:32,220
After Katrina which of course was arguably a natural disaster

1216
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,220
First thing that happened

1217
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:37,220
Guys swooped in there and they got rid of the public schooling system

1218
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,220
This is why people were still homeless man

1219
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,220
Even this is the all of course

1220
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,220
But people were in the astro dome

1221
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,220
Camped out

1222
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,220
Was it the astro dome

1223
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,220
Anyway

1224
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,220
The stadium

1225
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:50,220
And these guys swooped in

1226
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:53,220
And they changed the whole schooling system

1227
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,220
Now you get vouchers for charter schools

1228
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,220
In other words

1229
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,220
A commercial schooling system

1230
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:01,220
And this is systematic my friends

1231
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,220
This is what I'm seeing

1232
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,220
In Iraq, in Afghanistan

1233
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,220
There are no there are no guys on KP on kitchen patrol

1234
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,220
No

1235
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,220
We've got Burger King and Pizza Hut

1236
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,220
And we've got commercial laundry companies

1237
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,220
And everything is taken care of

1238
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,220
And everything is commercial commercial

1239
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,220
The military industrial complex

1240
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,220
Has spread like wild fire

1241
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:27,220
It's not just the military industrial complex

1242
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:31,220
No, now it's the schooling industrial complex

1243
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,220
It's like when the tsunami hit

1244
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,220
What's the first thing that happened

1245
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,220
Everybody lost their shirts, their lives

1246
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,220
And their beachfront property

1247
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,220
That is now taken over by property developers

1248
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:45,220
And turned into tourist hotels and other tourist shit

1249
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,220
And the guys who were like fishermen and shit

1250
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,220
Gone

1251
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,220
They don't own it anymore

1252
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,220
This is how the shock works

1253
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,220
And it's all based upon the learnings of Milton Friedman

1254
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,220
From the Chicago School of Economics

1255
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,220
Who literally thought that it would be a good idea

1256
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,220
And man there's world leaders who just have

1257
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,220
You know are the cycles of this guy

1258
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,220
He's passed away now

1259
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,220
The cycles of this guy

1260
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,220
And

1261
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,220
His idea was have a commercially run government

1262
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,220
Which is okay

1263
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,220
You know in some ways

1264
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,220
But it's not going to work

1265
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,220
Because people get greedy and rip you off

1266
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:24,220
And this is where all this money is just being taken away from us

1267
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,220
And it's happening at this very moment as we speak

1268
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:32,220
Money and wealth is being taken away from us

1269
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,220
Anyway, I feel really good about all this stuff

1270
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:40,220
Because once you can see it once you've figured it out

1271
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:44,220
It really is quite powerful and empowering

1272
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,220
Here's another example

1273
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,220
This is cool

1274
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,220
From this is London.co.uk

1275
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:54,220
Actually I saw this so the newspaper version of this

1276
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,220
How China's taking over Africa and why the West should be very worried

1277
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:01,220
And here's a picture of Chinese president who in tow

1278
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:05,220
With the Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe

1279
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,220
Because China's moving in man

1280
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,220
And Africa's looking towards the east instead of the West

1281
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,220
And Africa China's going to go in

1282
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,220
Great Africa

1283
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,220
Like the West has been doing all of these years

1284
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,220
They're going to promise all kinds of shit

1285
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,220
Take all their natural resources

1286
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,220
And then leave them to rot

1287
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,220
Once it's the economic hitman theory

1288
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,220
You know we all will promise all this stuff

1289
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,220
We'll put a little mark here in the database

1290
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,220
And new problem

1291
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,220
We'll take care of you

1292
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:38,220
There's already 750,000 Chinese in

1293
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,220
Let's see where it was

1294
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,220
Are they just in if they set all of Africa? Let me see

1295
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:47,220
Now you'll search 750

1296
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,220
Yeah

1297
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,220
With little fanfare staggering 750,000 Chinese

1298
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,220
Instead of an Africa over the past decade

1299
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,220
More are on the way

1300
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,220
The strategy has been carefully devised by the officials

1301
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,220
And Beijing where one expert is estimated that China will eventually

1302
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,220
Need to send 300 million people

1303
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,220
300 million people to Africa

1304
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,220
To solve the problems of over population and pollution

1305
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,220
Holy crap

1306
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:15,220
You got to read this article

1307
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,220
And by the way, I'm also linking to

1308
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:20,220
I got to figure out a better way to position the drop

1309
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,220
That is so powerful

1310
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,220
I love the drop

1311
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,220
We should make more use of comments

1312
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,220
And by the way, there's also a phone number

1313
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,220
You can use to call in a voicemail into the drop

1314
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,220
Which would be even cooler if we started using that

1315
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,220
I might start promoting that

1316
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,220
But wow

1317
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:37,220
Crazy, crazy stuff

1318
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,220
Alright, I got a couple more things to talk about

1319
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,220
But first, uh, or see, I guess a music

1320
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,220
I'm going to want to promote something

1321
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,220
Hold on a second

1322
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,220
Jesus

1323
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,220
Jesus

1324
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,220
What's that?

1325
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,220
God

1326
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,220
Hi Adam, it's Matt from Gamesweasel on this week

1327
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,220
Show we found real tournament

1328
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,220
Three on the Xbox 360

1329
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,220
I get all 40 with Beijing 2008

1330
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,220
The official game of the Olympics

1331
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,220
We look at brothers in arms, house, highway

1332
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,220
And we've got some news from E3

1333
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,220
That's all at Gamesweasel.com

1334
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,220
This, this, you think it will be so good

1335
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:13,220
I don't worry

1336
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,220
I couldn't resist

1337
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,220
Uh, so some news from the UK

1338
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,220
And then I got one more piece of news from the US

1339
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:26,220
Uh, the horrible, horrible thing

1340
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,220
That has been discovered

1341
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:31,220
There's this, uh, this place called Jersey

1342
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,220
I think it's the Isle of Jersey

1343
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,220
It is an island, I don't know what's called

1344
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,220
It's just called Jersey as far as I know

1345
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,220
Part of the United Kingdom

1346
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:42,220
And, uh, horrible discovery

1347
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,220
And over, like a hundred people have complained

1348
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:48,220
That they were abused at this children's orphanage home

1349
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,220
Over, you know, many decades

1350
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:52,220
And, you know, and people may like, ah, your cookie

1351
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,220
It's not true

1352
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,220
And, of course, there's a local government, you know,

1353
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:59,220
Very powerful officials on such a small island

1354
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:02,220
Well, just, uh, like two weeks ago

1355
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,220
This always seems to happen in these high-up political circles

1356
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,220
Which really drives me nuts

1357
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,220
Uh, they found a bunker nearby this orphanage

1358
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,220
And in this bunker, under an old war war two bunker

1359
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,220
Uh, but they found all these torture chambers

1360
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:20,220
In fact, they found 65 baby teeth

1361
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,220
They found charred bones and remains

1362
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,220
Pieces of a child's ear

1363
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:27,220
I mean, and this is exactly what these hundred people were saying

1364
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,220
It's like, this is nuts

1365
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:31,220
I mean, sexually abused and beaten

1366
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:34,220
And you should just, you know, look for the stories

1367
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:36,220
Although the kind of hard to find

1368
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,220
And I'm really suspicious about what's going on there

1369
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:42,220
So, um, the story is that a lot of high-ranking officials

1370
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,220
From the local government were involved in this abuse

1371
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,220
Which, of course, could explain

1372
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:50,220
If that were true, why, you know, the stuff has been stifled

1373
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:54,220
And now the main guy who was doing the investigation, you know,

1374
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,220
All of a sudden he's being replaced

1375
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,220
He's going into retirement within a year

1376
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,220
I mean, that shit stinks

1377
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:03,220
Look around the web and you look at child abuse and politics

1378
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:05,220
You could just google that

1379
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,220
You'll see all kinds of stories

1380
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:10,220
In fact, you, the older Chuckleheads may remember

1381
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:13,220
George Bush Sr.

1382
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:17,220
And the rumor is about the White House and Boys Town USA

1383
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,220
In fact, there's a documentary somewhere online

1384
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,220
That, uh, that was never broadcast

1385
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,220
I was forbidden

1386
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,220
Uh, but it really follows this

1387
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,220
I want to ask the guy's name

1388
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:31,220
Ah, I can't remember the name of the guy who else was in

1389
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,220
But it was a name

1390
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,220
Oh, Lawrence King, there you go

1391
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:36,220
It's just, yeah

1392
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:39,220
He just got a wondering, you know, is it just coincidence

1393
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:42,220
That this always ties back to politicians

1394
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:45,220
Or is there something about power that drives people crazy

1395
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,220
Or, you know, is this...

1396
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,220
Endemic to, I don't know, it's driving me nuts

1397
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,220
It's driving me nuts

1398
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:54,220
And I think we got to, and we just got to bite the bullet

1399
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,220
Open up a conversation about it right here on the Charlie

1400
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,220
And then finally

1401
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:04,220
This is from, uh, I love this

1402
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:08,220
This is from a UPI United Press International

1403
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:13,220
As an official, uh, an official news story

1404
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,220
But it's kind of sketchy

1405
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,220
Now, of course, we'll be talking about all the saber rattling

1406
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,220
With Iran as they call it

1407
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,220
So-called saber rattling

1408
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:25,220
Which, of course, is completely based on the Iran's threats to start

1409
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,220
Flooding the world's markets with cheap oil

1410
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:32,220
That sold in euros, which would, of course, would kill the dollar overnight

1411
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,220
Jerusalem, July 20th, UPI

1412
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:38,220
An unnamed Israeli security official claims US President George Bush

1413
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,220
Will attack Iran

1414
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,220
Blate this year

1415
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:45,220
If talks on the Mid East Nations nuclear program falter

1416
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,220
Now, of course, they've been given two weeks to come up with a

1417
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:51,220
Basically a statement that says, oh, we're not going to build any more

1418
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,220
We're not going to enrich any more uranium

1419
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:58,220
Even though it's, uh, our own, uh, research has shown that they're not

1420
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:02,220
Developed, haven't developed any, uh, nuclear weapons since 2003

1421
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:06,220
And this apparently is purely for, for energy purposes

1422
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:11,220
Israeli website, Debka file, I'm sorry

1423
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,220
Delta Echo Bravo Keto Alpha file.com Debka file

1424
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,220
Coating Israeli National Radio reported Sunday that a quote

1425
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:23,220
Highly-placed security political official said that Bush would order the attack

1426
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:27,220
Between November 4th, the date of the US President's election

1427
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:30,220
And his last day in office in January 2009

1428
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:34,220
Should Iran not agree to abandon its efforts to enrich uranium

1429
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:37,220
Debka file.com said the official made the statement

1430
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:40,220
Shortly after Sunday's talks between Western powers and Iran

1431
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,220
And Geneva ended in a deadlock

1432
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,220
There you have it. We have a date November 4th

1433
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:50,220
There you have it. And, you know, I think that, uh, just evaluating the situation

1434
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,220
It really won't matter who wins the election

1435
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:56,220
If it's McCain or if it's Obama or some other something swoops in

1436
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:59,220
It's just not going to matter this shit is just going to happen

1437
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,220
And it's fucked up and it's wrong

1438
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:04,220
And Iran is a nation of young people

1439
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,220
75% of the country is under the age of 30

1440
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,220
Are we completely nuts? This has to stop

1441
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:12,220
We cannot but this happened. We can't have this shit happen

1442
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,220
Not under our watch

1443
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:17,220
Go to our home

1444
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,220
In two, three, four

1445
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:32,220
Nothing but a chemical in my head

1446
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,220
Nothing but laziness

1447
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,220
