00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
About $16 million worth of airplane strap to my ass.

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I like to think I'm trying to reach this journey.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Podgestic is a battle curry.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And now it's time to question is it a lie?

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Who is it at a Montaukshu with the Daily Source code?

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
725.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm going to win the win.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to follow you back home.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm going to scream like you're there.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to wipe and break down and open up.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's time to let me learn to live again.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's time to let me give and give again.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's time like this.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You learn to go again.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's time like this.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Time to help you.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You gotta find out better,

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Never leave me forever.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
They won't afraid that they're brought loose, yeah

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Now and again, when I see your face

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You need to be waiting for me

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That you won't waste any of my steps

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You don't know, I've brought me pain

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You're never ready

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000

I'm a little too tired

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Do stay alive

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Leave it all alive

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm a little too tired

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm a little too tired

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm a little too tired

There's time like these

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Giving them give again

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, that's the way to arrive in San Francisco

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
There's a lot of guns and roses and food fighters

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Synchronize, match them up

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Sweet times of mine

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hey, hey everybody

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
How you doing?

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's daily source code episode number 725 coming to you from the curry condo

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I've spent let me see about 10 hours getting here

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Played around on the plane with the setup

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
With some degree of success actually

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I've completely reconfigured everything

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And I've even made it so that now I can

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Apparently actually take phone calls through the talk shoe system that I have set up

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And everything should kind of work I guess

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So of course everything could just blow up at any minute as well

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So we'll just have to take it as it is

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So the rules will be pretty simple

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
If you got something to say

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What I'd like you to do is in the in the talk shoe chat room

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Just just you know like basically raise your hand virtually speaking

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Tell me what you want to talk about

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Hopefully it's about a topic that is

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It is current as if this show

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And I'll see if I can get on

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Also got some phone calls of course

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Hey

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I've never since you started using a Ableton live

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
When the volumes kind of

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Every time the volumes go up a little bit

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If you're in music when you get a little excited

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You speak up

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
There's a crackling on top of it

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
When it's quiet don't hear it

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But every time the volume goes up

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There's just sounds like static and it's only the high volume

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So you're going to let you know

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yep

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You could also just say it sounds like shit

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, I think I fixed that problem

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And I'm not going to get into it today

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Because there's just so much in my brain hurts

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And oh man I spent an hour and a half of customs

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't even know if I want to talk about it today

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Actually when we get some more people on

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
People who can actually

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Talk

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I see looking at the room right now

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It seems like we've got

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't know like 20 people in there

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Lots of them on computers

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But only one of them actually

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Set up to talk

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So wait till a few more people come in

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You know Adam

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Just calling because they that

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I agree with the one guy from a few weeks ago

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Or when you last trip to San Francisco

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Your son did so like crap when you

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You first got out there

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
My question is if you're traveling so much

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
How come you don't believe a permit set up out there

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Mike Professor why do you have to chair it all with you

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I mean I can understand the

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Wanting to be minimalistic when you travel

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But if you've got a place to leave it why not

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You know

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I got to tell you

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And I was wondering this myself as I'm on the plane

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm thinking myself why why do I put myself through all this

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I mean I can

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Purchase a beautiful mobile equipment

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I can get full broadcast gear

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But it's been this quest of mine

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
For for

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh man better part of four almost going on five years

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I really just want everything to be self-contained

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I want to set up a certain way

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And I'm getting so damn close

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I can't even tell you

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So yeah, of course I could have a duplicate set up here

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But then you know what I'm in New York when I'm on the road somewhere

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't want to lug around a lot of stuff

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's also a big reason man

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Just lugging around the suitcase with mixers

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And the mixers aren't even in the the heaviest bit it's the

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's all of the power adapters you got to slap along

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So it's a quest

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I have no idea why I put myself through this hell

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So it's getting better

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But it's still not as good as it used to be

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I think that anyway when you make an empty three out of it

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's still not quite as good as it used to be

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So keep that's a good work

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Love you mean it right here

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Hope you win all that stuff

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh, yo, I'm losing light here

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
444

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
White

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Oh

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Three kids

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No time

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yo

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yo, and I know what that feels like for sure

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh boy

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yep, just gonna mess around a little bit more and actually what I'm hearing

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
In my headphones right now

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Sounds probably more shit than you're ever going to hear this episode

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
At least I hope so this is what my test have concluded up until now

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But we'll have to find out

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So we'll be taking some phone calls in a second

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But first this this this is something that came in from the Netherlands and I'm really jealous of this man

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Here I am podcasting for going on yeah four years

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I've never gotten anyone to do this with me

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You found that mark bar show

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh, yeah

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Hey Adam just letting you know how much fun I'm having with the broadcasting and stuff

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Uh, lately I've been interviewing people and listen what happened this weekend

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What happened this weekend

180
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's pink yeah

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And it is

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It doesn't smell

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You don't have orgasms very often

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No, we're not very easily

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Now that's well been and while we had trouble finding her g-spots

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So in the podcast we went to go look for it

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You think you found it

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I think so

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh, that sounds like it's working

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Now, maybe it can help other people who have trouble finding that g-spot

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So we have trouble finding that g-spot

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
To listen to this show because there's clear instructions of our scientific research

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Afternoon we did

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Thanks for the plug

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
www.markbars.com is the website

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And the show is a pot show too by the way

197
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I love you great hair

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
No homo

199
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And I'm a male totally chef from Tilburg the Netherlands

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Effort's weight

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't know what else you want to know

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I find that

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's good man, appreciate it

204
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He's lucky bastard

205
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He's when the jersey Todd turned me on to

206
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
787

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Hehe

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We bring a noise

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000

Come on

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
To sing

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Come on

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000

Come on

222
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We bring the noise

223
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,500
To hear

224
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:35,500
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I

226
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:04,140
Break is on a little bit more, we feel your scream underneath, we know your I got sound, we know wheps sticks out, we like to change it of switch it up, and, yeah.

227
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:34,500
I really should look it up. Actually, I probably could, I guess, let me see. I think they're like 10 years old or something.

228
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Man, let me look it up.

229
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Seven, five, seven. Brook and Tyler, many each other through the audition and selection process of radio Disney's pop group, RD7.

230
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,500
Oh, yeah.

231
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Oh, that's cute.

232
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,500
From the pot-save music network, seven, five, seven. We bring the noise on daily source code episode number,

233
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:04,500
120, five is worth testing out. The live set up Jay is in Pennsylvania, Jay.

234
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Yeah.

235
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Are you doing, man?

236
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Not bad. Thanks.

237
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Philadelphia, represented.

238
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Y'all, holy.

239
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Philly.

240
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Philly in the house.

241
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Most excellent, dude.

242
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,500
So there's like, there's like 20 people now. Maybe even 25 on now.

243
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
But you're one of the few.

244
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Are you on a computer? Are you calling in?

245
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Come again?

246
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Of course.

247
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,500
Why would it work?

248
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Crap.

249
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
There you go. Was that someone else?

250
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Sound like somebody else was trying to get in.

251
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Yeah. I'm not going to unmute anyone yet.

252
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
I'm just going to leave it all open.

253
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
See what happens.

254
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
You just flew in yourself from somewhere.

255
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Jay?

256
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:53,500
Actually, then we got the Twitter text on my phone.

257
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,500
I was like, oh, let me check that out. Actually, I was in St. Louis today.

258
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,500
And I was listening to your weekend episode of the test show.

259
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,500
And I hadn't tried anything with Twitter before.

260
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,500
So I logged in and created a Twitter account today and looked into it a little bit.

261
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:15,500
And they're going to let me at least follow Adam and see if I can catch one of his live shows again.

262
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
And sure enough.

263
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
And I didn't go.

264
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,500
Yeah, worked out.

265
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Yeah, I just flew in the afternoon.

266
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,500
And I went through the whole frickin' rigmarole again at customs.

267
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Except this time, the guy didn't know me.

268
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,500
So I had to go through basically the whole process.

269
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
You know, I got the little and first the guy.

270
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
It was a little different this time.

271
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
The guy in the glass cubicle.

272
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,500
He had that same puzzled look as always.

273
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
And you know, like tapping away on the keyboard.

274
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
And then he made a phone call, which was new.

275
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
And he called some other guy.

276
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
I looked at it and they tapped on the keyboard.

277
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,500
And he said, nah, you know, having to have him do a baggage check.

278
00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:00,500
And he wrote a baggage like BG on my, on my customs form.

279
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Then he crossed it out.

280
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
And then he put that M on it again.

281
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
And it's definitely an M, not a W.

282
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Yeah, you know, I was just two days ago.

283
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
I was in Canada.

284
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,500
And I was thinking about you because I filled out the agenda.

285
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,500
And as I came through customs, I watched what they did.

286
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
And I was thinking, let me take an extra one and see what happens.

287
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
Just in case.

288
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
But they stamped it.

289
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,500
And I'm thinking, Pan, how's that?

290
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
You can't falsify with the stamp.

291
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Why did you call it a gender?

292
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Are you a pilot?

293
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Yeah.

294
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
What do you fly?

295
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Yeah.

296
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,500
I fly an embryo regional jet.

297
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Oh, shit.

298
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Real hardware.

299
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
What's that?

300
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Real hardware.

301
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Yeah, man.

302
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
So you fly a king here.

303
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Let me, let me just finish this story before.

304
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Okay.

305
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Okay.

306
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,500
So, you know, so I get my suitcase.

307
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,500
It's it's first off the, off the belt as usual.

308
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,500
You know, so I hold on my passport and my, my customs form with the end.

309
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
I say, well, so I'll just walk straight over to those guys.

310
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,500
And he's like, and if they were really helpful for some reason.

311
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,500
This guy even said, hey, man, that's really weird.

312
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Is this happened a lot?

313
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,500
And I said, yeah, he says, maybe your passport numbers similar to someone else.

314
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
He's like, okay.

315
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
And so then I went up to.

316
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
His name was an officer, Ocada.

317
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:23,500
And, you know, so he went through the whole thing about asking for business cards and other forms of ID.

318
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
And I, you know, gave my pilot's license.

319
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
I was like a fuck with him and given it, you know, if you think I'm a terrorist here,

320
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
check out my pilot's license.

321
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,500
Right.

322
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:37,500
And, you know, and so then, you know, he went to the, the TL, which is the team leader.

323
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,500
And, you know, they looked at the computer and the guy said, well, you know, there's a lot of things in here.

324
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,500
But he asked me a couple of interesting new questions.

325
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,500
And the first one was, have you ever lived in Nebraska?

326
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,500
I'm like, wow.

327
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,500
No, he says, do you know, oh, what's her name?

328
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Oh, I wrote it down.

329
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Do you know Laura Rand?

330
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Do you know Laura Rand?

331
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
I'm like, Laura Rand?

332
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Yeah, she owns her own aircraft.

333
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
And this is getting weird, right?

334
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
I'm like, well, maybe.

335
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,500
I mean, it doesn't ring a bell, but, you know, I own my own aircraft.

336
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,500
So, you know, maybe it's someone I've flown with or I've known, which is almost like kind of stupid.

337
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,500
You know, why am I going to, I should just say no to everything.

338
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
And, but this was interesting information.

339
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,500
So, you know, I got to put a whole Google search in emotion to figure out who Laura Rand is.

340
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,500
And what she has to do with airplanes in Nebraska.

341
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:48,500
But anyway, you know, so I said, I said to the guy, finally, and after, you know, going through tons of tons of ideas, stuff, and paper works, shuffling around.

342
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,500
I, you know, I said, could you please tell me just what's going on?

343
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,500
He said, well, the way our system works is first it does look up by last name.

344
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Then it does first name.

345
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Then it does date of birth.

346
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,500
He said, on each of those three parameters, you get a hit.

347
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,500
So, there is someone whose last name is Curry.

348
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
First name is Adam.

349
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:14,500
And birth date is either exactly the same or close enough to mine, that they are, what they're really trying to do is,

350
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,500
ID me as, you know, not the evil Adam Curry.

351
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,500
So, so I finally have some information about this.

352
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
So, you know, they let me go, obviously.

353
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,500
But it was, it was, it was twisted.

354
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,500
So we got, we got to find out who this, this Laura person is,

355
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
and what she's doing in Nebraska.

356
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
And what she's doing here is remember,

357
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,500
a couple, I don't know, maybe it was a couple months ago.

358
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,500
A caller called in and benched something about a guy in a truck that said,

359
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,500
pod father was that guy from Nebraska.

360
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
And there's another Adam Curry.

361
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Something in my birth date.

362
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
I remember that episode.

363
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
No.

364
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
No.

365
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
I was recently catching up.

366
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,500
I'm some past episodes.

367
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
How long ago?

368
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
How old was that episode?

369
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
That's a good question.

370
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
I don't remember it.

371
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,500
I was catching up some episodes from the summer.

372
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,500
So it might have been back in September or late August.

373
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Some, I remember you getting a call or somebody called in,

374
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,500
saying something about a pickup truck in some Midwestern state that said,

375
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
pod father on the back license plate.

376
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,500
And you had to, you know, catch a picture of it next time.

377
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,500
That's ringing a very faint bell.

378
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,500
It must have been like a hundred episodes ago at least.

379
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
It probably wouldn't doubt it.

380
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
But anyway.

381
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,500
So you're on track to figure in this thing out.

382
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
I hope so.

383
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
They can't take anything out though.

384
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
They still can't help.

385
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
There's nothing they can do.

386
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,500
They can't, they can't remove my name from the database.

387
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,500
You said, you know, when you come in, just tell them that,

388
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
you're in the system.

389
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
That's when I say every single time, dude.

390
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
All right.

391
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Doesn't help.

392
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,500
So where'd you fly in from again today?

393
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Today there's insane lows.

394
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
I came in from St. Louis.

395
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,500
I was this a regular commercial flight or a private commercial flight.

396
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Good to you.

397
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Scheduled carrier.

398
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Scheduled operation.

399
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Yeah.

400
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Side around there all day.

401
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,500
I got in real late last night and just had a schedule to sit there today.

402
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
And last leg.

403
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
I finished up four day trip.

404
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Yeah.

405
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
One day parry.

406
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,500
So I'm off for three days.

407
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,500
And then I do a three day trip.

408
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,500
And then I'm off the remainder of the month.

409
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Nice work.

410
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
If you can get it, my friend.

411
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Yeah.

412
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
You know, it's okay.

413
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,500
The pills.

414
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,500
But the Italian man, the TSA.

415
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
It's a pain.

416
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
But I hate it.

417
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
No shit.

418
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Yeah.

419
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
It's the biggest downside to this job.

420
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
And you know, we have to go through it.

421
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,780
And I'm sitting there thinking, you know, these passengers every time I come through

422
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,500
security, these passengers look at us like we're crazy like why are you guys going through

423
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
security?

424
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Yeah.

425
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Yeah.

426
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Yeah.

427
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Yeah.

428
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Yeah.

429
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Yeah.

430
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Yeah.

431
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
Yeah.

432
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Yeah.

433
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Yeah.

434
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,500
Yeah.

435
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Yeah.

436
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Yeah.

437
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Yeah.

438
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Yeah.

439
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Yeah.

440
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Yeah.

441
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Yeah.

442
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Yeah.

443
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Yeah.

444
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Yeah.

445
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Yeah.

446
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Yeah.

447
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Yeah.

448
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Yeah.

449
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Yeah.

450
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Yeah.

451
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Yeah.

452
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Yeah.

453
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Yeah.

454
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Yeah.

455
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Yeah.

456
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
Yeah.

457
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
Yeah.

458
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Yeah.

459
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Yeah.

460
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Yeah.

461
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Yeah.

462
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Yeah.

463
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Yeah.

464
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Yeah.

465
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Yeah.

466
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Yeah.

467
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Yeah.

468
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Yeah.

469
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Yeah.

470
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Yeah.

471
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Yeah.

472
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Yeah.

473
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Yeah.

474
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:34,500
One, two, one, two, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one

475
00:22:34,500 --> 00:23:04,500
one, two, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one,

476
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Day to the city, give up now, let me suck your pity

477
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Don't you want to see the ship go down with me

478
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:31,000
Down to the rest of the night...

479
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,000
Time to rest spend the night...

480
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So I've been around...

481
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,500
Come of the low feet for dreams

482
00:23:44,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Oh, come on, let's say be chai-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

483
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:44,500
Rah-hram-rah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-

484
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
This is really weird.

485
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,900
It's, in fact, I've been kind of nervous about doing

486
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,460
the show this way, as I was setting everything up

487
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,820
on the plane, I'm like, this is going to be so weird.

488
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,260
I got to set some parameters and figure out

489
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,620
how this is going to work, because it's not quite the same

490
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:04,500
as, even though having the ability to take phone calls,

491
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,820
is of course very much the same as the radio work I used to do.

492
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,140
It's different.

493
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,700
I think in the future what I'll do

494
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,700
is, I'll post a couple links on curry.com.

495
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,740
Before I start recording, so that, you can take a look

496
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,340
at some of the stories I want to talk about,

497
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,420
and you can, maybe, form it opinion.

498
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:30,060
Actually, I want to go back to homeless second.

499
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,540
I'm going to go back to J for a second.

500
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,260
J, you still there, man?

501
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,260
Yeah, God.

502
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:40,380
I just got, I just got the final A, what is it?

503
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,180
A, A, I, B, report on British Airways,

504
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,620
the one that landed short.

505
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,580
Okay, yeah.

506
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,300
And here's the conclusion.

507
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,180
So, you know, it's a very detailed report.

508
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,820
You can, it's online, there's two things.

509
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,020
Yeah, so, so this is the interesting,

510
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,460
a continuing investigation.

511
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,380
Investigations are now underway in attempt

512
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,100
to replicate the damage seen to the engine high

513
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,700
pressure fuel pumps and to match this to the data recorded

514
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,700
on the accident flight.

515
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,020
So, they did find some anomaly, apparently,

516
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,660
with the high pressure fuel pumps,

517
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,140
and they can't figure out what it is.

518
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,140
And then there's also, there's also a safety recommendation,

519
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,780
because there was something else with the,

520
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,340
well, when they, they found out that the fuel control

521
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,700
was still on after they, after they had evacuated,

522
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,580
which doesn't sound right to me.

523
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,460
Essentially, the safety recommendation

524
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,500
is Boeing should notify all Boeing 777 operators

525
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
of the necessity to operate the fuel controls,

526
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,860
switch to cut off prior to operation of the fire handle

527
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,500
for both the fire drill and the evacuation drill.

528
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,660
That's weird.

529
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,940
You'd expect them, you know,

530
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,980
that's isn't it standard on every single aircraft,

531
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,020
it's like, you know, when you're about to crash,

532
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,740
don't you suggest to switch the fuel off,

533
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,180
or at least certainly before you leave the aircraft?

534
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,100
Well, when they pull the fire handle,

535
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,060
the fuel valves should shut off automatically,

536
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,340
at that point as well.

537
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,180
Yeah, it doesn't.

538
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,740
But it cuts the fuel off to the engines,

539
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:22,580
and down line as well, and I don't know about Boeing,

540
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,540
I don't fly Boeing product,

541
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,780
but I would think that a safety precaution,

542
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,340
you know, as the plane I fly, you know,

543
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,740
the valves are the lines will be closed

544
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,940
when the fire handle is approved or pulled.

545
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,060
So that, you know, it doesn't any kind of fire

546
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,420
or a potential of fire would travel down

547
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,940
through the lines to the tanks.

548
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,820
Well, the investigation continues.

549
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,940
We'll find out, but definitely a malfunction.

550
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,020
So a bit that gonna be all over that,

551
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,260
otherwise I can have to ground these triple 7s.

552
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,060
Yeah, it's kind of scary thought.

553
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,020
From what I heard, the last I heard was

554
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,580
that the aircraft engines were producing power,

555
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,860
but not the light.

556
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,020
Not enough was the light.

557
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,140
The light on the thrust levers.

558
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,660
In fact, it says in the report that, you know,

559
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,420
the last time they checked when they saw that the engines

560
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,740
failed to power up was they had an air speed of 107 knots.

561
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,540
I'd say that's not enough.

562
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,820
I think it's flying like a brick at that point.

563
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,020
Yeah, pretty much, you're coming down fast.

564
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,220
Yeah.

565
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,180
Got another, another call here.

566
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,100
Hey, Adam, this is Riched in Clagate.

567
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,940
I don't know.

568
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,900
I, with this morning about the launch

569
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,180
of a new online service for unsigned new artists,

570
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,540
launched by Paul Young, remember him from the 80s.

571
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,140
Wherever I may have, lay my hat and all that sort of thing.

572
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,060
Um, he told his servant,

573
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:59,940
what he told him, music as ETO, PIA, music.com.

574
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,340
We just meant to be a website where unsigned artists

575
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,980
can let a few tracks, so that normal punters can download

576
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,580
and they can get discovered by the music industry.

577
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,100
So their top ten artists are such unsigned,

578
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,380
unheard of people as simply red.

579
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,380
Bjork, Elvis Presley, Red Anderson,

580
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,820
I'm in Van Buren, Block Party, Tokyo Police

581
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,660
Love, Make Bear to Cossack and Fat Boy Slim.

582
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,780
Never heard of that, not.

583
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,300
Their top ten albums, Paul Weller, Elbow,

584
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,220
Lustrol, Cock 2 Twins, Stereophonics, Mercury, Rev,

585
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,340
Dave Matthews Band.

586
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,260
Well, I don't get it.

587
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,500
Is, is all of this available for free?

588
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,860
Or is this, I've got to check this side out.

589
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,260
No, this isn't pretty big names.

590
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,380
If that's a place where we can,

591
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,780
can upload and download courtesy of Paul Young, no less.

592
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,780
And the world Bob Marley and the wolf mother.

593
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,740
But now Young people all,

594
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,980
shall I bring them a bit to get sign up?

595
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,060
I'm sure.

596
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,740
And now they're charging our assists.

597
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,260
I have their tracks online for one to three tracks,

598
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,740
four pants for 50 a year.

599
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,020
Oh, I'm not just suppose.

600
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,740
But when are you getting in to having quite a few tracks

601
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,740
more than 30?

602
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,540
That's four to no pants for 50 a year.

603
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,180
And punters have to pay up a seat to download them,

604
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,460
but they're unrestricted.

605
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,380
Tracks is no copper protection or that sort of thing.

606
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,380
DRM free.

607
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,060
So I guess that's good.

608
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,100
But I thought that might interest you

609
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,860
if they're not how the pot-save music network.

610
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,340
Yeah, that's all from me.

611
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,940
So I can't say I love you on a middle-class English man.

612
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,660
So I'll just say I hold with high regard.

613
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,580
Best of luck with any hair competitions.

614
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,380
I'm 43.

615
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,900
In fact, nine days younger than you.

616
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,500
Married three children working in the media industry.

617
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,300
That's it from me.

618
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,060
Bye for now.

619
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,740
All right, man.

620
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,580
Thank you.

621
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,420
Appreciate it.

622
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:51,140
So I didn't prepare too much.

623
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,860
First of all, I'm really tired.

624
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,380
What time is it?

625
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,740
It's 10 30 here, so I'm going to go to bed pretty soon.

626
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,740
Let's see.

627
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,220
We got bird from Belgium on the line.

628
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,220
Bird?

629
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,220
Yes.

630
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,220
How you doing, man?

631
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,220
Good morning.

632
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,500
Good morning.

633
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,220
Good morning.

634
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,180
So what time is it there?

635
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,460
730 the morning?

636
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,460
Yes, that's it.

637
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,460
That's right.

638
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,180
OK, you have nothing better to do, Bird than hang out.

639
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,180
Well, actually, I'm preparing a proposal.

640
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,740
I just want to present that a customer at like 11.

641
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,100
So I'm sitting in my nose in the kitchen and preparing.

642
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,900
And I should be working with, I thought, well, I saw that the thing coming into

643
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,500
that's it.

644
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,900
Well, I'm going to go to the main child.

645
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,100
Oh, man.

646
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,820
Are you on a phone, are you?

647
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,500
Are you just on your computer?

648
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,340
On Skype?

649
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,660
Yeah, it sounds kind of shitty.

650
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,340
Just tell me what's the presentation

651
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,340
I'm going to make.

652
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:53,580
It's a, it's a, I can't say who actually, but it's a, it's a, it's a huge gas station

653
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,580
chain and everything for a company to help them with the marketing, their stuff to

654
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,580
in the internet.

655
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:05,300
And we're going to do a technical thing on how to integrate all the websites.

656
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:10,900
And we also have to, you know, invent a nice story about how we're going to mobilize people

657
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:16,500
and get some conversation and then they're brand and then, and then we're going to do

658
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
your sales result.

659
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:22,500
I am actually, what strategic fields are either something like that.

660
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
All right, man.

661
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,300
Unfortunately, your Skype is just too shitty to, to continue.

662
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,300
That's okay.

663
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,300
That's too bad.

664
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,300
But I appreciate you.

665
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,300
I appreciate you.

666
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,300
I appreciate you.

667
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,300
Okay, Bert, thanks.

668
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,300
TJ, steam or stain.

669
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
What is it, actually?

670
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,300
Hello.

671
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,300
Hey, man.

672
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
Hey, you hear me?

673
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,300
Yeah, of course.

674
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,700
Oh, cool.

675
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,100
I can't even say, it's kind of weird.

676
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,900
Um, yeah, is it DJ stain or DJ stain?

677
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,100
DJ stain, it's a Dutch name.

678
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,300
Ah, we have the, uh, the Europeans are awake today.

679
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,300
That's nice.

680
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:01,700
Yeah, well, I'm going to Australia, but, um, my dad's Dutch sir.

681
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,700
Holy crap.

682
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,700
So, it's, what is it in Australia Thursday?

683
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,700
Yeah.

684
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,500
Uh, yeah, that's about it.

685
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,300
It's one of the two days in the week.

686
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,300
All right, man.

687
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,700
What time did it just tell me what time is there?

688
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,700
Is it like 12 or 14 hour time difference between here and San Francisco?

689
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,100
Uh, yes, yes.

690
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,900
The moment, yes, the morning hours.

691
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,500
Okay.

692
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,300
All right, dude.

693
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,300
Well, enjoy.

694
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,300
I appreciate you.

695
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:36,300
You might have mentioned something about, uh, major bandwidth, um, here in Australia.

696
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:45,100
Um, we, I think we pay, uh, about $90 a month for, um, 25 gigs.

697
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,700
And, uh, we kind of just make it within that and then forget over.

698
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,300
It's, um, slow down to dial up speeds.

699
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,500
So I hate it when they do that.

700
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,100
I hate it when they, when they start messing with your connection.

701
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,300
And then you get really, really slow speed.

702
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:04,100
Yeah, um, and so what I have to do, like, sorry.

703
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,900
Drop, uh, uh, listen to, like, all the podcasts I want to.

704
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,900
Because I listen, like, keep breathing, anything big video podcast.

705
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,700
I'll have to download them, like, in the last few hours of the billing cycle.

706
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,500
So that we don't get so down during the months.

707
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,300
And so that I can listen to watch on my stuff.

708
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,700
Oh, that sucks.

709
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:28,100
So what, can you buy extra bandwidth or do you have to pay overage when you go over your 25 gigs?

710
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,900
Well, on the, on the plan well, you don't have to pay overage, but most plan to do.

711
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,700
With most companies.

712
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:42,500
I think the highest plan you can go on is broadband is like 60 gigabytes or something.

713
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,300
Which, yeah.

714
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,900
I tell you, man, I'm amazed that you guys have any kind of broadband down there.

715
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,900
I was in Australia.

716
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:59,900
I did a documentary in 1991, I think, um, and, you know, no one had heard of the internet.

717
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,700
And I looked at the country.

718
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:07,700
And I, you know, I went to Kubor PD and a couple other places I stayed in the out back.

719
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,100
And just in general, I was like, how are they ever going to wire this place?

720
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,900
So the fact that if any kind of connectivity at all, you know, Australia, I'd say you're a lucky.

721
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:17,900
Yeah.

722
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,500
That's true.

723
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:21,900
All right.

724
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,300
So it seems like we got to, it's probably a little bit too late for most people or, you know,

725
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:35,300
a good time for you guys and them in, uh, was it, uh, was it, uh, was it afternoon where you are?

726
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,300
And morning in Europe.

727
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,300
Call it on Europe.

728
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:37,700
Yeah.

729
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,300
But, uh, all right.

730
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,700
So maybe we'll have more callers tomorrow.

731
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,300
Let me, uh, see if I can fire some over here.

732
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,100
Hey, bird.

733
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,700
Thanks, man.

734
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,300
I'm sorry.

735
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,900
DJ Steen and Bird and Jay.

736
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,900
Thank you guys very much for calling in.

737
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,700
Can I have me to come?

738
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,700
All right.

739
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,700
Good dog.

740
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,700
All right.

741
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,700
Take it easy, guys.

742
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,700
I appreciate it.

743
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
Yeah.

744
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,700
All done.

745
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,700
One sec.

746
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,700
I'll be right back with you.

747
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,700
And I'll pay you too much.

748
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,700
And I'll be so weird that I cannot seem to pray for you.

749
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,700
I'm running the mail store.

750
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,700
I'm driving me where I can help myself.

751
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,700
I'm trying to speed up my phone.

752
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,700
So yeah.

753
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,700
Try to keep my distance.

754
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,700
I'm your coach.

755
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,700
You're taking this way.

756
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:07,700
I've never heard of you.

757
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:12,700
I've never heard of you.

758
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:18,700
I've never heard of you.

759
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,700
Makes me weak in the needs.

760
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,700
Makes me so, I can't breathe.

761
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,700
Once my dream is when I see.

762
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:38,700
I'm coming so with dignity that I cannot seem to pray for you.

763
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,700
I'm running the mail store.

764
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:47,700
I'm running me where I can't help myself.

765
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,700
I'm trying to speed up my phone.

766
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,700
So yeah.

767
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,700
Try to keep my distance.

768
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,700
I'm your coach.

769
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,700
You're taking this way.

770
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,700
So good old.

771
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,700
So good old.

772
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,700
So good old.

773
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,700
So good old.

774
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,700
Simple smile.

775
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,700
Feels like I want to be lost in love.

776
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,700
I'm not in love.

777
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,700
Cause I've never heard of you.

778
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,700
And I can't seem to fail.

779
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,700
So good old.

780
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,700
So good old.

781
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,700
So good old.

782
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,700
So good old.

783
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,700
So good old.

784
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,700
So good old.

785
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,700
So good old.

786
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,500
It's now and you know when I can't help myself

787
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,000
I'm not a sweet bird, I'm from a soul yet

788
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,100
Try to keep my distance on now

789
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,200
Because you'll be the same

790
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,700
I'm not in the midst of the pain

791
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,000
It's Kirsten Gray, blood from a stone

792
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,700
From the pot-save music network of course

793
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,200

And just looking at the talk shoe interface here

797
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,700
Lots of people with lots of comments

798
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,700
But you guys should be calling in

799
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,700
You know, don't just listen in, call in

800
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,700
Next time, tomorrow

801
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,200
Alright, that's it for episode 7-25

802
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,700
With a daily source code

803
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,700
I'll be here all week everybody

804
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:40,700
I'll just talk in the background there to Jay

805
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,700
And you said, how long are you going to be in San Francisco?

806
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,700
I don't know

807
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,700
A week, 10 days, something like that

808
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,700
I have to be home by the end of the month

809
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,700
I don't know for sure

810
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,700
Anyway, for those of you who called in

811
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,700
Thank you very much

812
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,700
And we'll try it again tomorrow

813
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,700
And I'll try and post a link with some stories

814
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,700
To look at earlier on in the day

815
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,700
And so we can have some rants and raves

816
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,700
Looking forward to it

817
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,700
Until then

818
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,700
Live your life with passion

819
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,700
And enjoy your freedom

820
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,700
Another pod show pod cast

821
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,700
Stick it in your ear
