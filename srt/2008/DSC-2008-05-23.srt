1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We are all with a program with a special boy.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
America is now under martial law.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All kinds of people right have been pathetic.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Take your home.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Do not attempt to contact.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Love one is for an agent or attorney.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Shut up.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Do not attempt to think or depression may occur.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Stay in your home.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Her view is at 7 p.m.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Start after work.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Anyone caught outside the gate to prepare some divisions.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Sectors after curfew will be shot.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Remain call.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Do not panic.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Your neighborhood, what officer will be by to collect urine samples in the morning.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Anyone caught interfering with the collection of urine samples.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Will be shot.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Stay in your home.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Remain call.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The number one enemy of raw grass is a question.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
National security is more important than individual will.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
All boy's raw test will proceed as normal.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No more than two people may gather anywhere without permission.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Use only the drug required by your boss or supervisor.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Shut up.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Be happy.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Obey all orders without question.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The comfort you demanded is now mandatory.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Be happy.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's why everything is done for you.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
$60 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The next generation brand new content in my ears.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We don't need us digging trees in.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jar.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Fantastic.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's a battle curry.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
In a world where you have to remind politicians that they work for us.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Where the need for nuclear energy has never been greater.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Where money drives the wheels that turn the engine.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When all around you seems too barred beyond what you can handle.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You need to take a moment to catch your breath.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Look at DSC.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
7.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
61.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Crank up the tunes at them.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We need to imagine the light.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
About a home.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Or a country to call you alone.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We'll thank God.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The girls here who gave their last to make this.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Home of the brave.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hey, here come in.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The only energy that you feel free.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If I feel release, raise your head on your heart.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And share the fear of the U.S.A.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Today.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm used to bow.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
We've fought our way.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Give us all we have today.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Graves souls.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Mark it.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Graves treasure you can.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hear them say.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hey, here come in.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The only energy that you feel free.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If I feel release, raise your head on your heart.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And share the fear of the U.S.A.A.A.A

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:31,000
to D.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Remember that.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,580
Survey day sunshad down allorphs fade

72
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,860
Gails clear when the place came down

73
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,160
Parajas low world thron the ground

74
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,540
Watchin' this朋友in' cry

76
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,260
Fear won't run all the day

77
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,740
Pinky tidak pride a way

78
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,740
If they don't know about

79
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:44,740
Find a day from town to town

80
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,740
We paid the price

81
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,740
Freedom to save

82
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,740
We'll ask to show

83
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,740
Still eat the way

84
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,740
Freedom to save

85
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,740
Freedom to save

86
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,740
Freedom to save

87
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,740
Freedom to save

88
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,740
Freedom to save

89
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,740
Freedom to save

90
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,740
Freedom to save

91
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,740
Freedom to save

92
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,740
Freedom to save

93
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,740
Freedom to save

94
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,740
Freedom to save

95
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,740
Freedom to save

96
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,740
Freedom to save

97
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,740
Freedom to save

98
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,740
Freedom to save

99
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,740
Freedom to save

100
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,740
Freedom to save

101
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,740
Freedom to save

102
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,740
Freedom to save

103
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,740
Freedom to save

104
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,740
Freedom to save

105
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,740
Freedom to save

106
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,740
Freedom to save

107
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:52,740
Oh, who can forget that classic?

108
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:00,740
Listening to the heart and soul of this next one, you'll know he's singing straight to the Lady Patricia.

109
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:10,740
All the greatest is brought to you as only Adam Creak in.

110
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,740
Just listen to this.

111
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,740
Yes, now we can all hit the dance floors AC's done.

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,740
Yes, for limited time only it is Adam Creak sings by now.

114
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,740
It's Adam Creak sings.

115
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,740

D, mashed up for you on D, S, C, 7, 6, 1.

155
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,740
Wow, I've got a musical sound auditory collage,

156
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,780
all set up for you, my friends.

157
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,820
Not too much content.

158
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,020
Gotta keep it low on the content.

159
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,820
Gotta keep it real high on the music.

160
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,540
I just feel like it's a Friday.

161
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,580
And I just want to play some awesome tunes for you.

162
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,300
Got some great feedback.

163
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,940
Remember when comic strip blogger

164
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,860
lashed out at my sister, Willow, who lives in Italy,

165
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,980
in reference to restriction of freedom of movement,

166
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,660
apparently the, quote, gypsies and no longer

167
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,100
allowed to travel around freely around the country.

168
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,300
And it's a lot wrong with Italy.

169
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,260
But when you say to any curry, when you say,

170
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,700
oh, I bet you you won't say anything,

171
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,460
you probably won't stand up.

172
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,300
You're gonna find out that we are made

173
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,500
from the same wood comic strip blogger.

174
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,900
Here is my sister Willow,

175
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,020
checking in from Italy on the football Friday.

176
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,940
Oh, Adam, it's your sister calling from Italy.

177
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,260
Of course, I'm calling in response to CBS.

178
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,700
Oh, fuck you, CBS.

179
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,940
Of course, I'm not afraid to speak up.

180
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,660
The other thing is, country is so fucked up.

181
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,580
It has so many issues.

182
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,860
And of course, the whole Romanian and the role

183
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,500
of my Egyptian issue and it's a positive question.

184
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,620
Like so many other things.

185
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,580
I mean, I'm not afraid to speak up.

186
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,300
I'm just trying to do the best I can

187
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,940
and my Michael environment.

188
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,620
I mean, I'm just trying to live my life

189
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,100
with the values I do right.

190
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,460
And I'm trying to read my kids with those values.

191
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:29,340
And even people who can get all these people

192
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,900
into the streets and like the comedian,

193
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,300
that they do though.

194
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,220
I mean, you've got hundreds and thousands

195
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,420
of people on the street protesting.

196
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,780
What was the result?

197
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,940
Nothing.

198
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,060
Absolutely nothing.

199
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,940
So basically what I'm trying to do is

200
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,020
just trying to be part of the solution.

201
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,860
Because now, if you're not part of the solution,

202
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,940
you're part of the problem.

203
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,700
So anyway, I'm trying to do the best I can.

204
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,940
I'm not afraid to speak up.

205
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,300
I will agree and not afraid to speak up.

206
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,100
You see, yes.

207
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,500
I mean, what's your real name?

208
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,780
Do we know your real name?

209
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,380
I mean, are you afraid to speak up?

210
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,220
Or do you all speak?

211
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,300
I'm in the name of comic strip blogger.

212
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,660
Oh, oh, that one hurt after she had CBS a couple times

213
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,100
and then CSB, then she finally struck home.

214
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,340
Yeah, comic strip blogger.

215
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,100
How about you, man?

216
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,940
What's your real name?

217
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,660
Come out of the closet.

218
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,780
Anyway, I think that was about what I wanted to say.

219
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,340
Oh, by the way, Adam, you know, how do you

220
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,300
do you want to picture me in the bathtub with a note here?

221
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,260
I don't really like to picture you with your prevention quota.

222
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,220
Anyway, that's all.

223
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,060
They work for us.

224
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,580
Hell, they do.

225
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,580
Yeah, no, I can understand that is kind of weird.

226
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,660
You know that, so the prostate cancer prevention quota thing.

227
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,860
That's really, it's playing a mind trick on people.

228
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,060
You know, we've done a lot of mind tricks, Vulcan, mind tricks I might add here on the

229
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,060
daily source.

230
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,260
You'll recall the the burping association with the Senseo coffee machine,

231
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,100
which I think by now most people are pretty much deprogrammed.

232
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,340
I hope I have no way to really deprogram the other than just to stop doing it.

233
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,100
But this rubbing one out for cancer for those of you just joining the program in the

234
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
community.

235
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
Welcome.

236
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,540
You're now in official chucklehead.

237
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:19,300
Studies and studies have not survey studies have shown that masturbating five times a week,

238
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,100
a minimum of five times a week can actually reduce the chance that you can contract prostate

239
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,220
cancer by, I think, up to 60 or 70%.

240
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,180
But just me talking about it has, well, it has a couple of different results.

241
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,780
One is people are taking note.

242
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,780
They're keeping track.

243
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,900
By the way, I'm at three so far for the week, so I'm a little bit behind, but we still

244
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,460
have Saturday and Sunday.

245
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,460
And sales guy, you put certain savant.

246
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,460
Oh, he's got a whole other problem with this deal.

247
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,460
Adam, sales guy, you're Germany.

248
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,460
You just got back from a beautiful holiday in Italy, Serenzo, Costa Capriña.

249
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,460
Oh, it's beautiful there.

250
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:58,460
Scott, talking about masturbation on your show.

251
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,460
I'll tell you why.

252
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,460
Okay.

253
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,460
Each time I try to have fun with myself, pleasure myself.

254
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,460
You know, run one out for the team.

255
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:13,460
Now, I get this visual of you sitting in a barbedrope doing the same thing at exactly the same

256
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,460
time.

257
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,460
It's not stimulating.

258
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,460
It's not helping me.

259
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:25,460
So, quit talking about it or have a lady talk about it or have somebody do a cute

260
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,460
or do it.

261
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:40,460
It does not help when people like yourself or CSB or the candy man or nylon talk about masturbation.

262
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:46,460
It gets in my head and I want to think of beautiful blonde chicks when I masturbate.

263
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:52,460
Not of overweight, shall be computer nerds.

264
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,460
All right.

265
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,460
I'll meet a snitzle from beautiful Sunny German each out.

266
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,460
Yo, man.

267
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,460
Absolutely.

268
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,460
Oh, okay.

269
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,460
So, female chuckleheads.

270
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,460
Your work is now officially cut out for you.

271
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,460
I can no longer speak about this because it's definitely harshened.

272
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,460
The male chuckleheads mellow.

273
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,460
What we need is we need some helpful reminders from you.

274
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,460
Just record them.

275
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,460
Send them in on MP3 or call the voice mail lines.

276
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,460
Remember, you're doing this for the mankind.

277
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:29,460
Bettering mankind and to help prevent prostate cancer.

278
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,460
Nothing is all right till we decided it is.

279
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:21,460
Just get away from me.

280
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:41,460
I'm going to make it right tonight tonight.

281
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:48,460
I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down.

282
00:17:48,460 --> 00:18:15,460
I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down.

283
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:26,460
I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going down, I'm going, I'm going down.

284
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:38,460
I'm so lonely in my pocket

285
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,460
I'm lonely in my pocket

286
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,460
I don't remember where I got it

287
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,460
I gotta get it to you

288
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,460
So please answer the phone

289
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,460
Because I keep falling but you're never

290
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,460
What am I gonna do?

291
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:12,460
I'm so lonely in my pocket

292
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:18,460
I'm lonely in my pocket

293
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:31,460
I'm lonely in my pocket

294
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,460
I'm so lonely in my pocket

295
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:42,460
I'm lonely in my pocket

296
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:48,460
I'm lonely in my pocket

297
00:19:48,460 --> 00:20:00,460
I'm lonely in my pocket

298
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:06,460
I'm lonely in my pocket

299
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:15,460
I'm lonely in my pocket

300
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,460
The way we want to chase, we know

301
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,460
The way we want to chase, we know

302
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,460
The way we want to chase, we know

303
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:34,460
The way we want to chase, we know

304
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:40,460
The way we want to chase, we know

305
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:46,460
The way we want to chase, we know

306
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:54,460
The way we want to chase, we know

307
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:24,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

308
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:54,460
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

309
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:01,460
And you'll be telling me you're gonna have me

310
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,460
You're gonna have me

311
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,460
But you don't have me

312
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,460
But now I'm in too deep

313
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,460
She's gonna be so that I just can't sleep

314
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,460
Loving me out of here

315
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,460
Please get me out of here

316
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,460
And just help me out of here

317
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,460
You're busy

318
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,460
You're just home

319
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,460
You're gonna have me out

320
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,460
Tonight I'm home

321
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,460
I'm gonna make you the right

322
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,460
Tonight tonight

323
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,460
Tonight

324
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:56,460
Tonight I'm gonna make you the right

325
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,460
Tonight I'm gonna make you the right

326
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,460
Tonight

327
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,460
Tonight

328
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,460
You know, honestly, I really don't know where I sourced all of the tracks for today's football

329
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,460
Our Friday edition of the Charlie from that lot of it came from

330
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,460
The source code drop the drop.io slash daddy source code

331
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Some of it from the

332
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,460
Podsate music network

333
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,460
It's just all over the place

334
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,460
I don't even know if I can do the show

335
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,460
Notice for this

336
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,460
But that's the

337
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,460
The final name is the clip tones

338
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,460
24 hours crazy tonight

339
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,460
Strong teeth

340
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,460
I'd say a massive mashup right there for you

341
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,460
Oh my goodness

342
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,460
And we're like 25 minutes into this

343
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,460
And I still have so much more to go

344
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,460
Because it's Friday of course

345
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,460
And we haven't done a football Friday in two weeks

346
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,460
It's a very special hit test line now for you

347
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,460
Because it is episode number 123

348
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,460
Typical young palettes

349
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,460
Send me one says it's a special one

350
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,460
Because it's one two three

351
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,460
Let's go

352
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,460
We're all in casting with

353
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,460
I'm curious

354
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,460
This is the hit test

355
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,460
Hit it test

356
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,460
Young bowl

357
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,460
Hey Adam, how are you doing?

358
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,460
I'm good man ready for one two three

359
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,460
Meet us again at this one special

360
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,460
Because all of the songs are from 1987

361
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
So here we go

362
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,460
I'm here for a good

363
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,460
Okay, I'm gonna suck for one two three

364
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,460
I have no idea what that is

365
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,460
Number two

366
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,460
That sounds like

367
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,460
Level 42

368
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,460
I don't remember the song

369
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,460
I think it's level 42

370
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,460
And final one is number three

371
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,460
That's definitely level 42

372
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,460
That's

373
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,460
Runs in the family

374
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,460
I don't know what the second was

375
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,460
And times up and here are the answers

376
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,460
Who is it?

00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,460

379
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,460
Mark is awesome

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,460
How the hell would you do that young?

381
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,460
I love it, Mark King

382
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,460
My favorite bass player

383
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,460
They're all three level 42

384
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,460
Young second with the hits

392
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,460
I can't believe it

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,460

What's in this two

399
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,460
I believe the voice

400
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,460
He said that he would thank you

401
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,460
He'd make you so miserable

402
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:27,460
He wrote it in the family

403
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,460
Answer number three

404
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,460
Also by level 42

405
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,460
And all of them are from 1987

406
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,460

That concludes hit test number 123

408
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,460
So how did you do Adam?

00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,460
Well, you surprised me, on of course

410
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,460
Eventually figured out it was level 42 for 1, 2, 3

411
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,460
Excellent, thank you so much John

Take care and try to think with your heart

426
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,460
Bye bye

427
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:32,460
I'm almost done

428
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,460
I'm almost done hold on let me just put it in

429
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,460
Let me put it in

430
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,460
I knew I had it somewhere my iTunes

431
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,460
Well, shit if we're going to do a level 42 special

432
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,460
We might as well play a full track by the band

433
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,460
One of my absolute favorite level 42 tracks

434
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,460
The one that we played over and over again

435
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,460
To the vinyl was literally grey

436
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,460
A decimal radio and half spam at the early 80s

437
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,460
This is the live version

438
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,460
Which just takes all the boxes

439
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,460
Thank you, John

440
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,460
Thank you Mark

441
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,460
Here's love games

442
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:38,460
I can see my life you're by

443
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,460
You mean everything to me

444
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,460
Just can't take no more

445
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,460
Throw smile my way

446
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,460
As a pain I feel inside

447
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,460
Just to love for you

448
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,460
And I'm yours

449
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,460
I'm yours

450
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,460
I'm yours

451
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,460
I'm yours

452
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,460
I'm yours

453
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,460
I'm yours

454
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,460
If you want to show your heart to me

455
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,460
Said a new way

456
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,460
Once I hold you back

457
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,460
You love me and your friends

458
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,460
But in time can't do the game

459
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,460
I won't play the whole

460
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,460
I believe I'm right

461
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,460
When I say you love me too

462
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,460
But it can't go on

463
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,460
You're okay

464
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:21,460
You're okay

465
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,460
I'm yours

466
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,460
I'm yours

467
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,460
If you want to show your heart to me

468
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,460
Said a new way

469
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,460
As a pain I feel inside

470
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,460
Just to love for you

471
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:42,460
And I'm yours

472
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:12,460
Said a new way

473
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:17,460

Said a new way

492
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,460
Saying a new way

493
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,460
Said a new way

494
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,460

Said a new way

501
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,460
Said a new way

502
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,460
Marking is awesome.

503
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,460
Oh man, give me some more of that face.

504
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:13,460
Ah, yon, so of course in acquiring mines when I know how you hooked up with Mark King.

505
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,460
It's a small world man. Let me tell you that.

506
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:27,460
I love 42 love games. I think that was from 83, maybe 84, which at the time I think we dubbed the year of the base in the big smoke city of Amsterdam.

507
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:33,460
As I said, we played this song over and over and over and over again. Just loved it so much.

508
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,460
Another thing, you know, talking about long versions.

509
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:42,460
As I said, you know, there's so much cool stuff that you can do that you can't do on traditional radio.

510
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:48,460
And one of them, or actually a couple of things I've been doing over this past week has been playing poems,

511
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:53,460
poems that people have recorded, either other people doing it or themselves,

512
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:58,460
and the data source code drop is a great place for these. There's a new one up there.

513
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,460
It's nine minutes.

514
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,460
So I haven't even listened to it myself all the way through yet, but you might want to go have a listen.

515
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,460
And these things really are striking accord with people.

516
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,460
Adam, it's Marcus Noble again.

517
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,460
I just wanted to tell you, I just was finished listening to your latest episodes.

518
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,460
Yeah, see, I'm on my lunch break at work right now.

519
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:22,460
And I just want to say that I love these poems that you're playing out love can hear more of some, you know.

520
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,460
As I'm sure others have said before, but I just want to make sure you know this.

521
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:32,460
Yeah, this is very good, you know, very moving stuff you're playing here.

522
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:36,460
And this is sort of stuff you won't get on TV, won't get on radio.

523
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,460
And exactly.

524
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:45,460
Yeah, this is the kind of thing that people really need to hear regardless of, you know, what political party or for, or anything like that.

525
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,460
So anyway, um, great here.

526
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,460
I love you, you know, homo, I hope you end.

527
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,460
I'm a folder, 23, and I'm single and college doing so.

528
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:06,460
I'm lucky enough that I'm able to get to take care of my prostate cancer prevention quotient twice a day.

529
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,460
And they work for us and they don't fucking realize that soon.

530
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,460
Yeah.

531
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,460
Hell yeah, hell yeah, they work for us.

532
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,460
New sign off everybody.

533
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,460
They work for us and you know they do.

534
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:23,460
And we got a new savant who is this, um, spontaneously presented himself to the Charlie with a beautiful MP3 recording.

535
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,460
Please welcome Charlie.

536
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,460
This is the Bruce here.

537
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,460
Ah fuck.

538
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,460
What does it Charlie when it's Bruce?

539
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,460
Oh, I see why.

540
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,460
Uh, please welcome Bruce.

541
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,460
Um, I'm a fan first time calling.

542
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,460
I know your show is a guy show.

543
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,460
Not necessarily a guy show.

544
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,460
We've got some ladies out there.

545
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,460
I show.

546
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,460
I think.

547
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,460
But I like it too.

548
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,460
And I'm gay.

549
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,460
I listen here from T. West Florida.

550
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,460
And a lot of my friends listen to you too.

551
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,460
Um, as a group.

552
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,460
Anyway, here's an idea.

553
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,460
A little silly.

554
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,460
I just got a visual of that.

555
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,460
A little idea, just for fun.

556
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,460
But how about me being your homo, Saman?

557
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,460
Use the homo, Saman.

558
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,460
Awesome.

559
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,460
Bruce the homo, Saman.

560
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,460
You're in.

561
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,460
I don't need to hear the rest of the comment.

562
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,460
You're in my friend.

563
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,460
I can tell you there's some real science behind homo sexuality.

564
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,460
Um, just for instance, did you know that extensive homo sexuality is found among seagulls

565
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,460
off the coast of California, like almost 15% of gals are gay?

566
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,460
Yeah, let me guess.

567
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,460
Are they in San Francisco?

568
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,460
Um, I think that research was done in San Francisco.

569
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,460
I'm not sure.

570
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,460
Yes, really.

571
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,460
Listeners need to understand us.

572
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,460
Obviously, some already do.

573
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,460
But we're in the minority.

574
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,460
I'm sure.

575
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,460
Okay.

576
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,460
So homo, Saman.

577
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,460
That is unless you're anti gay.

578
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,460
I mean, no homo is simply a declaration, right?

579
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,460
Um, not like implying bad juge or something, right?

580
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:48,460
Um, or you could have me as Charlie Savage's avant whatever.

581
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,460
Oh, and here's another idea.

582
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,460
How about Adam Curry's homo sexual moment?

583
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,460
No.

584
00:36:54,460 --> 00:37:00,460
But I thought really, you just really might really like me to provide regular insights

585
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,460
as installments of information and understanding about that.

586
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,460
That's weird.

587
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,460
Wait.

588
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,460
Did you say inspiration?

589
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,460
No.

590
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,460
Let me hear that.

591
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:14,460
To provide regular insights as installments of information and understanding about us

592
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,460
queer, we're human too.

593
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,460
Is there a genetic component or not?

594
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,460
Um, you know, I could tell listeners about stuff like that.

595
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,460
Let me know, bye-bye.

596
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,460
No.

597
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,460
Great hair.

598
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,460
Hope you win.

599
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,460
Love you, mean it.

600
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,460
Platonic.

601
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,460
Uh, yeah.

602
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,460
Homo and my quotient is anywhere from five to 12 per week,

603
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,460
depending on various circumstances.

604
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,460
Rachel.

605
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,460
Let me know.

606
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,460
Bruce.

607
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,460
Oh, man.

608
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,460
I hope you're for real.

609
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,460
And for a couple seconds, I don't know.

610
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,460
This is for real enough.

611
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,460
But of course, you're more than welcome.

612
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,460
Everyone's welcome to be a chucklehead.

613
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,460
And yes, you are here by the official, uh, homo savant.

614
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,460
Whatever that means.

615
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,460
Um, I think, you know, probably when we have some questions about the topic

616
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,460
is when you want to weigh in, not just jump all over the place,

617
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,460
but happy to have you on board, my friend.

618
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,460
And please enjoy your food, my friend.

619
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,460
There once was a song called The Rest of President.

620
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,460
Contemporary music.

621
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,460
It was the kids.

622
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,460
It was a top 10.

623
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,460
I wasn't popular, so I missed the bus a bit.

624
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,460
The politics was on everybody's heart, the summer list.

625
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,460
The cool kids were all rocking votes.

626
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,460
I shit you knuck.

627
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,460
I was pistol whipping cops for hip-hop.

628
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,460
I'm a slow-box.

629
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,460
Y'all in into mega-fones.

630
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,460
The killing hard-box.

631
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,460
Using cartes and the stepping stones.

632
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,460
I had a thermostat except holding my marches.

633
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,460
The day that Chris Columbus got crucified and called the marches.

634
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,460
My pen is still as too tall to climb off.

635
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,460
And in fact, that's the reason for the hot-haw.

636
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,460
And I went up here and seen the reason on my side of course with.

637
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,460
I'm the dog to win the pros and a push-up contest.

638
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,460
All for the sake of military refruiting.

639
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,460
The fellow can't stake the way they targeted the students.

640
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,460
I got a ball.

641
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,460
Whistling Ohio.

642
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,460
It's the rest of us.

643
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,460
I'm doing a stand-up at a cricket convention.

644
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,460
Who was they thought?

645
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,460
No, no, no, no, no, no.

646
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,460
What they thought?

647
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,460
They've made a machine that leaves the quality of black gold.

648
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,460
And a prominent look at the quality of black gold.

649
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,460
They've got the quality of black gold.

650
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,460
They've got the pie, so all that.

651
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,460
But they can't paint it.

652
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,460
First, the time taken from minimum wage paper.

653
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,460
I don't care how that's making it all fake.

654
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,460
She looks.

655
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,460
She smells like dirty cash in each paper.

656
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,460
So what's your time with your time?

657
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,460
We'll downbody you killing them.

658
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,460
Slow downbody you killing them.

659
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:31,460
Now it's with the low versus the pistol holder.

660
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,460
Case dismissed.

661
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,460
The lock you up and throw away the key witness.

662
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,460
Just this is the whim of a judge.

663
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,460
Check his chest density.

664
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,460
It leaves much room for error.

665
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,460
And the rest left a death thing.

666
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,460
The West Memphis Re-Loss Paradise.

667
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,460
It's death penalty.

668
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,460
Versus suicidal fantasies.

669
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,460
All I wanted was a fucking Pepsi.

670
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,460
Institution.

671
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,460
Making you think it crazy is a billion-dollar range of street.

672
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,460
They could sell sanity in a bottle.

673
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,460
They'd be charging for compressed air.

674
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,460
They're marketing healthcare.

675
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,460
They're demonized welfare.

676
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,460
Middle class eliminated.

677
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,460
Rich kid.

678
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,460
Rich kid.

679
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,460
Rich kid.

680
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,460
They're poor kid.

681
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,460
Educated.

682
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,460
What's from the y'all still having grown into your face?

683
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,460
Are you face something quite match your head?

684
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,460
And I'm waiting for a brain to fill the dead space that's left.

685
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,460
Your own kid.

686
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,460
Me ethnicity.

687
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,460
You'll give me dread.

688
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,460
Just a funny and rebel.

689
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,460
Without a cause for a long.

690
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,460
Cause when postures the shove.

691
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,460
You jump into your forefathers home.

692
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,460
Sees a banker.

693
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,460
Your part of the system.

694
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,460
All throw the tread blocks.

695
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,460
And comes in.

696
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,460
Come briefcase.

697
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,460
Free space.

698
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,460
Significent.

699
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,460
Own a camera star.

700
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,460
Hold and say to fuck out of the picture.

701
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,460
Bill Royce.

702
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,460
Free space.

703
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,460
Significent.

704
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,460
Own a camera star.

705
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,460
Hold down.

706
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,460
Under your killing.

707
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,460
Mr. Save the world.

708
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,460
Spares the details.

709
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,460
Save the females from losing interest.

710
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,460
And misstate the universe.

711
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,460
You're a damsel in distress.

712
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,460
Tie down to a track of isolated incidents.

713
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,460
Generalize.

714
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,460
My disease.

715
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,460
I need a taste of what it's like.

716
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,460
Living off the fat of kings.

717
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,460
I play the scab at your hunger strike.

718
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,460
The strike.

719
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,460
The strike.

720
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,460
The strike.

721
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,460
The strike.

722
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,460
Slow down.

723
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,460
Under your killing.

724
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,460
One love.

725
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,460
One life.

726
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,460
One too many victims.

727
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,460
Republic rat democrat.

728
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,460
One party system.

729
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,460
Media goes in a frenzy.

730
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,460
The stripped of their credentials.

731
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,460
Presidential candidates.

732
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,460
Can't debate over this instrumental.

733
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,460
Let them freestyle.

734
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,460
Winter takes all.

735
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,460
When the music settle.

736
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,460
Have Ted Newtons head hanging on my wall.

737
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,460
Kill one of ours.

738
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,460
We'll kill one of yours.

739
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,460
A friendly fire.

740
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,460
That's a funny turn.

741
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,460
Like civil war.

742
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,460
Sixth in the morning police have my crib.

743
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,460
Now my knife consists of two, two.

744
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,460
Sixth in the eyelids.

745
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,460
The cruiser fixed in vitamins.

746
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,460
Music that is pirated.

747
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,460
Newflaid.

748
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,460
The food made of mutated hybrids.

749
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,460
Oh.

750
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,460
They tell me that it's not that bad.

751
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,460
Who fucked you up good.

752
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,460
But it's not that bad.

753
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,460
They hold on to these tales.

754
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,460
To list the door that wax.

755
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,460
God save us all.

756
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,460
Let be list the cattle.

757
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,460
The foul.

758
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,460
The foul.

759
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,460
We're the blame for the strain.

760
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,460
A muggle.

761
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,460
Of course.

762
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,460
Who can kind of hate.

763
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,460
But prep a can.

764
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,460
Hold a sword.

765
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,460
It's the same.

766
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,460
Who can complain about the muggle more.

767
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,460
A can.

768
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,460
Oh.

769
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,460
Four.

770
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,460
They call the shots.

771
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,460
But they're not in the line of fire.

772
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,460
I call the shots.

773
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,460
But they break in the line of duty.

774
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,460
Let's call the shots.

775
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,460
To the abuse of authority.

776
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,460
The truth keeps calling me.

777
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,460
And I'm a lift to tell the story.

778
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,460
So let's not true.

779
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,460
Crits begin forgiveness.

780
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,460
You need to cut the news.

781
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,460
But you don't believe in scissors.

782
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,460
Use the words of truth.

783
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,460
Over here in yellow ribbons.

784
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,460
Just bring home a mother fucking brother.

785
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,460
This is this.

786
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,460
Cuz they don't call the shots.

787
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,460
But they're in the line of fire.

788
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,460
I'd like to call the cops.

789
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,460
Let's they break in the line of duty.

790
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,460
I call the shots.

791
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,460
You're beautiful.

792
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,460
You're beautiful.

793
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,460
You keep calling me.

794
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,460
And I'm a lift to tell the story.

795
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,460
You hear that brook.

796
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,460
You hear that Hillary.

797
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,460
You hear that George.

798
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,460
America's youth is pissed off.

799
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,460
Bring our brothers and sisters home.

800
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,460
Stop the madness.

801
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:38,460
We made a super star.

802
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,460
That is what you are.

803
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,460
Coming from a farm.

804
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,460
Rating with your own.

805
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,460
Come away with me.

806
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,460
To another inch.

807
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:53,460
We can rely on a tree bread.

808
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,460
Your honor.

809
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,460
I'd like to make a motion.

810
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,460
To rock this mother out.

811
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,460
Your honor.

812
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,460
Please don't bang that gavel.

813
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,460
You can try this cowbell out.

814
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,460
Let's don't give a night.

815
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,460
To the harness.

816
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,460
Working lawyers.

817
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,460
Jersey's dying.

818
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,460
Yeah.

819
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,460
It's Jersey's dying.

820
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,460
Oh yeah.

821
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,460
Your honor.

822
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,460
What is.

823
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,460
Yo.

824
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,460
How's it going?

825
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,460
Adam.

826
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,460
It's a special musical of the Chacha.

827
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,460
So I got something beautiful for you tonight.

828
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,460
I'm really, really digging this track.

829
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,460
The guy's name is JJ Appleton.

830
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,460
And he's really, really good.

831
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,460
He's been huge in Europe.

832
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,460
And I think he's going to make it here in the United States as well.

833
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,460
I love the song.

834
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,460
The song is called today.

835
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,460
Today.

836
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,460
Today.

837
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,460
And it's just beautiful and hopeful and wonderful on your football Friday.

838
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:07,460
Hey.

839
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,460
Danger dream.

840
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,460
A little bit longer.

841
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,460
Just for the heat.

842
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,460
A little bit stronger.

843
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,460
Heavy hours.

844
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,460
You've seen the rough and tumble.

845
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,460
A long the road.

846
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,460
We've had a few stumbles.

847
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:34,460
And when you can't believe we're lonely.

848
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,460
She wanted everything.

849
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:41,460
To me.

850
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,460
Yeah.

851
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,460
It's Jersey's train this fast ride.

852
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,460
Tomorrow's every day.

853
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,460
Tomorrow.

854
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,460
But it always comes on time.

855
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,460
So we've got a today.

856
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,460
Today.

857
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,460
Today.

858
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,460
And the weather else.

859
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,460
The rain.

860
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,460
But here.

861
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,460
Today.

862
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,460
The rain.

863
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,460
Today.

864
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:07,460
Today.

865
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,460
Today.

866
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,460
Today.

867
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,460
You.

868
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,460
You.

869
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,460
You.

870
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,460
You.

871
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,460
You.

872
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,460
You.

873
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,460
You.

874
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,460
You.

875
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,460
You.

876
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,460
You.

877
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,460
You.

878
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,460
You.

879
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,460
You.

880
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,460
You.

881
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,460
You.

882
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,460
You.

883
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,460
You.

884
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,460
You.

885
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,460
You.

886
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,460
You.

887
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,460
You.

888
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,460
You.

889
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,460
對.

890
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,460
Being sorry for everything.

891
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,460
Every path.

892
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,460
We're still struggling here for tomorrow,

893
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,460
tomorrow.

894
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,460
And a race.

895
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,460
Here.

896
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,460
competed,

897
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,460
gonna die.

898
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:57,460
Tomorrow's a dream, but it always comes on time

899
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:02,460
So what we got is today, today, today

900
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:07,460
No where else can we live in the edge of day

901
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:14,460
No where else can we live in the edge of day

902
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:20,460
No where else can we live in the edge of day

903
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:55,460
No where else can we live in the edge of the edge of day

904
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:02,460
No where else can we live in the edge of day

905
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:23,460
I know about you, but music truly started to mean something to me again.

906
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,460
It's like a awakening game.

907
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:32,100
Expertly, source by Sir Jersey, top the official musicologist of the Charlie, the G.J.

908
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,100
Uperton, today, today, today from the pot-safe music network.

909
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,100
Go ahead and find the music on Potchio.com.

910
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:43,860
We're going to miveo.com and just search on a music you'll find it no problem, what's so ever.

911
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,900
Oh man, another matchup for you.

913
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,540
It's going to be probably about an hour and 10 minutes today's show, but well worth it.

914
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,780
What do you get when you put any wine house together with Ella Fitzgerald?

915
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,780
Well, this would be the result. Enjoy this.

Kind of a funky mashup that made me wine house versus Ella Fitzgerald, Marky Boy brings

950
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,780
you back to the Ritz.

951
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:56,780
On the early source code episode number 761, the Maxo Music Fubar, Freitrain Experience.

952
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:06,060
You know, the daily source code drop was you can find a drop.io slash daily source

953
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:12,380
code is wow what a fantastic tool that is I had loved it so much and we already had filled

954
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:18,700
up pretty much a gig worth of stuff one gigabyte and so I'm hunting around right I'm

955
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:22,780
trying to find a place to upgrade to buy more space because they gave me the one gig for

956
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,100
free which was really nice so I sent a couple emails finally I get an email back so like

957
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:31,820
I did we upgraded you to 20 gigs because we're still in alpha you can't really buy anything yet

958
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:37,660
and then it's been fantastic because you guys have been dropping all kinds of cool stuff in fact

959
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:43,580
some of the stuff has even been dropped in twice hey Adam this is being down here and good old

960
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:50,780
Houston Texas hey that's a big pool of money uh so that you're talking about is from this American

961
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:56,140
life which is a great little NPR radio show they also have a podcast that's how I normally

962
00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:02,220
listen to them and they use they have some great stuff on there so if your listeners want to

963
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:08,460
check it out uh this American life dot board is the website and I will talk you soon have a

964
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:13,500
great day bye bye you killed in the traffic here oh don't do that and they work for us my friend

965
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,660
yeah this is what I was talking about on Wednesday uh this is the show uh we you it starts off

966
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:21,660
with an award show where all these banksters are handing each other out of awards including in

967
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:27,420
award for a CDO which is the pretty much the basis of the the credit crunch oh by the way and this

968
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:32,140
is something that will definitely bring up with John C Devoreca tomorrow I know agenda front page

969
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:41,420
of the financial times yesterday um the ratings agency that rated these uh these uh funds I guess you'd

970
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:46,780
call them like the CDOs which of course were backed up by by mortgages that were flaky to say

971
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:53,660
the least if not completely shot in worthless these um these financial instruments were getting triple

972
00:52:53,660 --> 00:53:00,620
A status from moodies and obviously moodies was wrong because well you know they weren't triple A they

973
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:08,220
were maybe triple D double D at best so there's been a lot of investigation into this and uh yes

974
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:16,540
they front page financial times moodies the guys who are I think really um not fully but

975
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:22,220
certainly partially responsible for this whole mess their answer their reason why this all went wrong

976
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:29,740
it was a software error yeah we had a coding problem and they discovered this a year ago these

977
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:35,980
guys are so full of shit I say lock them up in the brink every single one of them hey Adam it's a

978
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:40,780
go our full of mic here I was just reading a pretty interesting quote from the American Institute

979
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:47,820
of Architects and said building the account for 48% of US energy consumption and generate

980
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:53,820
far more greenhouse gas emissions than any other sector not thought that was pretty interesting especially

981
00:53:53,820 --> 00:54:00,060
with our recent discussions on nuclear energy you know it seems that it will be pretty easy to

982
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:05,660
start building nuclear power plants to replace those cold burning plants we have now to fuel these

983
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:12,220
and if we take it as further and say the people start to split you over to electric cars

984
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:17,980
where are they getting the power for those cars uh huh that's right the same nuclear power plants

985
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:23,020
that are fueling our buildings I don't know just a thought oh yeah don't forget those douche

986
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:34,300
bags are people just like you and me and they work for us oh yeah oh man you got me on that one yeah

987
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:39,580
I'm getting more and more interested in nuclear that's the kind of energy that I think we can really

988
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:43,820
do something with but we've been pre-programmed for some reason this is bad and you can't get rid of

989
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:51,100
the waste and and the waste is green ooze goo this oozing all over the place um I think we've

990
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:55,660
we've really been taken for a ride I think the technology is improved and we have us a Vaunt to tell

991
00:54:55,660 --> 00:55:00,540
you all more about it is name of course is atomic rod atoms and uh specifically specifically

992
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:06,860
Rod's gonna talk to us about nuclear waste remember nuclear it's the way to go it's the way of the

993
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:15,820
future powered by nuclear hey Adam it's atomic rod I heard you play you the last comment and you

994
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:22,860
keep asking about the waste let me tell you the waste is a valuable byproduct the

995
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:31,020
is recycle not sensitive and just recycle it usually again and use a viable material and

996
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:38,620
oh by the way during my day job I work for you I interesting that's not my didn't know about atomic

997
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:45,020
rod he apparently works for the government ah he's just risen more notches on my list excellent

998
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:51,260
so wait a minute so we can recycle nuclear waste we can recycle it we can reuse what can we reuse

999
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:57,100
it as could we put it back in the reactor or what can we do atomic rod please do tell me more this

1000
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:03,820
is exciting news yeah there's a discussion group that we have amongst the the mevio producers

1001
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:09,020
oh I don't okay sorry about that once and a while the the map just gets to excited on a food bar

1002
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:16,140
Friday um and we have all kinds of discussions and there are some of them are um out not right

1003
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:21,820
flame wars which is always fun and a lot of them are very personal and I've talked about

1004
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:28,060
Robin and Suzanne who do the show inside works more than one song the daily source code

1005
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:33,260
and the Suzanne has been going through a couple of health related issues and you know they had

1006
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:40,540
a bit of a scare going on there and you know Robin shared that with his friends and if I'm very

1007
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:49,340
happy to say that all the producers are his friends in a way and we send a lot of positive energy

1008
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:55,660
a lot of love and things definitely seem to be looking up and I could not be happier because

1009
00:56:55,660 --> 00:57:01,420
they certainly need some tailwinds and I think they got him hey Adam this is Robin just want to

1010
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:08,780
call and say I am a lucky man I'm humbled by my friends and my family and especially thankful

1011
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:15,420
for my friends and my family so that does make me a lucky man so rock on with the food bar Friday

1012
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:29,580

1013
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:41,020
and waging by the door oh what a lucky man he was

1014
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:51,100
who a lucky man he was

1015
00:57:51,500 --> 00:58:02,140
whitelist and feathers they made up his bed

1016
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:11,900
I go over the mattress on which he was led

1017
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:17,740
he went to my horse for his country and his king

1018
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:36,620
pop his honor man's glory the people who are lucky man he was

1019
00:59:47,740 --> 01:00:01,740
the problem is nothing but rude as he played nobody laughs

1020
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:14,740
And I know I love you man, he was

1021
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:20,740
Oh, I love you man, he was

1022
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:59,740
I told you we go about an hour and ten minutes looks like I'm just about spot on.

1023
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,740
Emerson Lake and Fomer, what a lucky man, he is

1024
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:06,740
For Robin, and of course, Suzanne.

1025
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:17,740
Oh, I love that. Oh, man. Yeah, I got one more track for you.

1026
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:22,740
Well, actually, we should wind up the week with something we haven't done in a while, which is of course.

1027
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:25,740
What day is it today? It's Friday.

1028
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:27,740
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

1029
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:31,740
Food about Friday at a spinal fund for the week.

1030
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:35,740
As everybody is time for your final thought of the week, you know?

1031
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:37,740
It kind of struck me as I was going through the show.

1032
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:41,740
We need to think about over the weekend as our final thought of the week.

1033
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:48,740
You see how easy it was for me to accidentally program people's brains like sales guy you.

1034
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:53,740
But I have heard this complaint from a couple other people, just by talking about the prostate cancer prevention

1035
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:59,740
and people thinking about me doing, you know, like, you know, hand-to-gland combat, polish the pope.

1036
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:07,740
Stuff like that, that freaks people out. So how easy is it to be programmed about stuff through, you know, simple things like the media?

1037
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:13,740
Do you think we're being kept kind of dumb, perhaps? Do you think that they're really happy with all these reality shows?

1038
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:19,740
You know, the people I'm talking about, the ones that work for us, they work for us.

1039
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:23,740
So maybe there is something to new clear when it comes to energy.

1040
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,740
Maybe there is more to be done with it.

1041
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:29,740
Maybe we've been programmed through imagery of atomic explosions that's not going to be good for us.

1042
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:35,740
Maybe the answer is right underneath our nose as only there's financial gain for others that is holding us back from the true solutions.

1043
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:39,740
That my friends is your final thought for the week.

1044
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:49,740
And now the song that I've been waiting for to play for you for at least four years.

1045
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:55,740
I was unable to find it in the iTunes Music Store, unable to find it anywhere online even at

1046
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:59,740
Seepa.com, which is where I rip all the best stuff.

1047
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:07,740
Finally, I found out through a message on drop.io slash daily source code that it is available for sale

1048
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:13,740
at emusic.com. And of course, I'm signed up emusic.com slash daily source code.

1049
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:19,740
I got 35 free songs. This was one of them, The Alessie Brothers.

1050
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:29,740
I'd like to stay in love with you all summer and after fall.

1051
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:35,740
I'll keep you warm through the window.

1052
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:39,740

Oh, this mark's really long,

1079
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:41,940
You danced for me while you're at me

1080
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:45,240
Because I know after you knew

1081
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:51,240
When we knew I'd made love to reach out to you

1082
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:54,740
When I'm glad to see you

1083
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:59,740
So I wanted you

1084
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:05,240
Love you

1085
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:09,040
Gimme brands and braces

1086
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:12,580
Baby make it to the heart

1087
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:15,760
See the  icy

1088
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,720
Love you

1089
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:23,540
I've been born again

1090
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,560
Oh yeah

1091
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,960
I think it must have been the summer of 75.

1092
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:33,960
I was a wee boy, maybe 11, 12, maybe 13 years old,

1093
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,920
madly in love with a girl at school and just thinking about

1094
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,560
riding with her on my handlebars through the middle,

1095
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,560
and really didn't be in.

1096
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,520
That's from the soundtrack to my lives.

1097
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,760
Have a good share with you on the source code.

1098
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:19,400
Oh, man, perfect way to finish off the week.

1099
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,600
As if we are from our Friday maximum music freight training

1100
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,600
experience, the LSE Brothers of Glory.

1101
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,120
Bruce, Bruce, I need help.

1102
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,600
Okay, everybody, I will be back on Monday,

1103
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,360
which is a bank holiday here in the UK.

1104
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,920
I think it's a memorial day in the States.

1105
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,440
I'm not quite sure anymore.

1106
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,440
In the meantime, get your voice mails in.

1107
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:47,000
Send in your MP3s, Adam and me, vio.com, get your music requests in.

1108
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,280
Drop stuff and the drop.drop.au slash daily source code.

1109
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,840
And of course, keep up on the blog at curie.com.

1110
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:56,200
Until we speak again, have yourselves a fantastic weekend.

1111
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,440
Live your life with passion and enjoy your freedom.

1112
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,840
Another fine, medial presentation.

1113
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,840
Stick it in your ear.
