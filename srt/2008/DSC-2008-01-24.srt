16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

You're listening to the Daily Source code with Adam Curry.

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And his audience have meant well, love him.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No, homo.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, we're right.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Running your pants through my hair.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's made them loud.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
They're like the jungle for us.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But at least you see what you're doing here.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This man comes and knows none of this magic is not known.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's waving your wall in your ear.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Shots off.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Please, the woman's dead.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You give you back these problems to some of you.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But you don't even answer me.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I wanted to get on it.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Someone's got me.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Baby, give me his phone.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm freaking.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You see your 10 boys.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Break your love.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's what I like.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Break your love.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I give the up 10 boys.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Break your love.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's what I like.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Break your love.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
In terms of goals, we're saddened.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
My left and maybe.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In terms of best of what the smell of the scene of the fun.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I couldn't see who was the looks you were after.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Now you place me on your kid and shop.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I've never met you two.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I've never met you.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I've never met you.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I've never met you.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I've never met you.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I've never met you.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I've never met you.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I've never met you.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I've never met you.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've never met you.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I've never met you.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I've never met you.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're the one you love.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Break your love.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's what I like.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Break your love.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Get out of your heart.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Break your love.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's what we've had.

Break your love, get girls to make it easy

Eyes to sex so crazy, my pretend is so insane

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,640
Oh, get it, I'm dying

72
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,560
So let it all at tonight tonight

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,480
Boys will be boys, no to challenge

75
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,440
The boys will be boys, no chance

76
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,780
Boys will be boys, no to challenge

77
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,640
The boys will be boys, no to challenge

78
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,480

00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,040
Boys will be boys, no to challenge

80
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,340
Co unmotic boys, no to challenge

81
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:36,260
Well, that doesn't open up the deranity and you, I don't know what else will.

82
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:42,940
It's uptown, boys, regular, Tyler Burns from the Faud Save Music on the daily source

83
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,060
code episode 713 coming to you from the curry kind of over about it.

84
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:54,740
Now, let me ask you, if there was definitely one thing you wouldn't do when you were

85
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:01,180
going on the road, would you change your road base setup?

86
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,980
I bet you wouldn't, oh man, oh, oops, sorry about that.

87
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,220
Nice little fade out there, wonderful.

88
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,820
Yeah, here's what I've done.

89
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,460
Actually it was Franco from Rokostitalia who turned me on to the new version of Ableton

90
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,620
Live, which is now up to number seven.

91
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,420
The line I went back to my email actually and I looked, and I guess maybe the release

92
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,580
numbers correspond with the year that they were released because it was 2005 when I

93
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,180
last looked at Ableton Live and just like every other program for the Mac, really,

94
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,540
I think we've come into a beautiful crux kind of an intersection where everything

95
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,660
all fits together where we have the processor speed is fast enough, the software is

96
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,980
lean and mean enough where you can actually just plug in a microphone and there's no latency.

97
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,780
I mean, there is, there actually is a few milliseconds, maybe it's less than one millisecond

98
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,580
latency, which the program just needs to keep pace with itself.

99
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,220
So why don't you be along on the ride with me to find out if they actually hangs together?

100
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,500
I gotta tell you, it looks pretty, actually, you know what, why don't I make a screenshot

101
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,580
of it home on a second?

102
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,580
I think I can do this, who knows what will happen, right?

103
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,580
All kind.

104
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,580
Okay.

105
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,220
I don't know if that worked enough, but it seems like we're still recording, so I'll just

106
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,220
leave it as it is.

107
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,860
Yeah, it's actually a little bit past six a.m. it's now about six twenty five.

108
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,980
I got in last night, or actually yesterday afternoon, now I apologize because the

109
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,180
first of all, I thought I was going to be able to do a show on Tuesday, turned out

110
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,060
Tuesday in the city was a lot easier than I expected.

111
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,060
I didn't get home until relatively late.

112
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,220
And on the way home, I found out, oh, you know what, I really do need to go to San Francisco.

113
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,500
And of course, we have one of our infamous board meetings today, actually.

114
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:54,380
So, Lickley split, booked a flight, flew out Wednesday morning, flight, of course, was

115
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,780
nice on eventful.

116
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:01,500
I was actually, I slept for a couple hours, which is nice, maybe three, four hours.

117
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,540
Now, it just started watching this movie, I think it's called Shut Up, I think, or

118
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:12,020
it's about a WLDJ PD Green in Washington.

119
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,180
And I was about twenty minutes into it, and there was sales weasel Greg stand the next

120
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,540
to my seat, who was on the same flight, he had been in London, he had been working with

121
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,820
Vanessa, our sales weaselette in the UK office.

122
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,060
So he went down to the bar.

123
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,780
I've never actually sat at the bar on Virgin on a Virgin flight, and it was Greg, because

124
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,060
there was no one else there, and the minute you sit down, they start to serve you, you know,

125
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,620
it's like, can get you drink, you know, want something to eat, we'll mix them off to

126
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,100
noon tea, so it was nice, and we chatted for at least an hour and a half, maybe even two

127
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,100
hours.

128
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,020
It was good, we really got caught up on a lot of things.

129
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:51,060
And of course, I said, hey, you know, I would invite you to ride with me into the city,

130
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,060
but guess what?

131
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,940
I'm pretty sure that they're going to flag me and they're going to stop me.

132
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,980
So we went through customs together, lo and behold, and actually, you know, it happened

133
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,980
once again.

134
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,580
Custom guy said, hey, wait a minute, aren't you, um, aren't you, uh, that, uh, I said, yeah,

135
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,580
the MTV guy.

136
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:12,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the MTV guys, you know, uh, I thought you would kind of, you know,

137
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,700
I kind of saw that look and I thought you look familiar and I said, you know, the look

138
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
you have on your face right now.

139
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,740
I've seen that for the past five times, I've entered the U.S., because you're looking

140
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,900
at me going, that's the MTV guy.

141
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,300
How come I've got to put a M on his uh, customs form?

142
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,220
He said, yeah, I don't know, man, but there's definitely something in there.

143
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,060
And it's an M, it's definitely an M.

144
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:37,180
I'm trying, I know one will tell me what the M stands for, um, I, you know, I, I just,

145
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,620
I can't even come up with anything.

146
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,620
So yeah, um, I had to go through, uh, and actually I took a little different approach

147
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,060
this time, um, you know, I was all smiles and like, hey, how you doing?

148
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,100
Oh, I guess I should go straight ahead there.

149
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,660
Yeah, I know where to go and he, you know, once again put my customs form, the little

150
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:59,140
blue plastic, uh, clicking on the thing and, uh, and walked me over.

151
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,260
And this time, there was a guy there who had, um, investigated me before.

152
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,860
And he's like, wow, man, you're still on the list, uh, yeah, this is, uh, well, how come

153
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,020
you can't get off of this?

154
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,460
I said, uh, I think you know the answer to that, to know, I have a piece of paper and you

155
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,780
can send it and I was like, yeah, right, that's the freedom of information, act piece

156
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,660
of paper that I got in New York the last time.

157
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,420
He said, yeah, yeah, it doesn't really make any difference.

158
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,420
Yeah, you're right.

159
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,300
But anyway, you're okay, go on through how about that, huh?

160
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,700
How about that for some service?

161
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:36,020
Hey Adam, Adam, this is Andrew from the Bay Area, uh, I'm way behind on the episodes, but

162
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,820
I just want to call you having a discussion about why you appeared on the Homeland Security

163
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:46,420
or Customs, no fly list, or at least check you every time you do fly list.

164
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,900
One thing that I hadn't heard about up yet is the fact that you're a pilot.

165
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,940
You mentioned that they have this database or this sort of checklist where you check

166
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,980
a certain number of boxes, then you get put on that list or you get flagged for screening.

167
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,420
So my guess is, uh, one of the big boxes you check is the fact that you're a pilot, if you

168
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,900
remember, obviously 911, the guys trained as pilot.

169
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:13,180
So, uh, in addition to you, you know, flying in and out of the country a lot, uh, the

170
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,980
fact that you and yourself are a pilot, okay, that has triggered something in their database.

171
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,340
Anyway, just not to you.

172
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,340
Yeah, well, interesting thought, and when I think about a little bit more, yeah, you know,

173
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,140
if you put it all together, the fact that I've been to Kuwait, uh, Kuwait, sorry, uh,

174
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,860
the fact that I've been to Iraq, uh, this was, by the way, all my previous passport, but I'm sure

175
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,700
the information carried over because I had to get visas, at least for Kuwait, I had to get a visa.

176
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,900
Uh, add to that a pilot's license, uh, remember there's everything from the DMV to the IRS

177
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,980
and his database and this illegal database, I might point out, which is not supposed to

178
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,980
exist according to Congress, but it is there.

179
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,740
Uh, the, the knocking and, uh, and all the, uh, sounds you hear is a combination of me sitting

180
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,740
at the, uh, at the table, I'm not at the Bakers' rack because basically, all I have now

181
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,180
was just my Mac, how about that?

182
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,060
I don't have 15 outboard pieces of gear.

183
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,860
It's the first time I've come to San Francisco without the Violopt laptop, which includes

184
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,860
cast blast.

185
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,180
So I was really taking a risk saying, you know what, if I'm going to do it, I'm just going

186
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,180
to do it.

187
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,060
See if I can get this thing to work, uh, hopefully so far.

188
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,060
So good.

189
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:21,460
You know, it was a, um, maybe it was, uh, the beginning of, uh, last week, or maybe even the

190
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:27,300
week before that at the end, I was talking about, uh, the Nokia N-810, the internet tablet.

191
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,740
By the way, uh, I'm the top seller so far, uh, from what I understand, uh, these are

192
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,780
unofficial numbers, it's actually work and people have purchased it at the best price

193
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:43,340
anywhere on the internet, 15% discount if you use the code daily source code, um, and, uh,

194
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,540
and thank you by the way for those of you who've purchased it for sending me, uh, you know,

195
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,300
nice little emails about how much you love it.

196
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,540
I told you I wouldn't steal you wrong on this thing, but, um, so maybe a week ago, two

197
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,980
weeks ago, I was talking about using log me in on, uh, on the tablet to get to other computers,

198
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,380
basically, like, uh, kind of like what Apple is trying to do with their, um, uh, back to

199
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,020
my Mac, which just doesn't work very well across all different networks.

200
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:10,900
I mean, I've tried every, every combination, um, and, you know, I really just want to be

201
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,460
able to take over a control of the screen of at least, you know, four of the computers

202
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,460
that are in my life.

203
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,620
Most importantly, the one that my wife uses because, you know, from time to time, she just

204
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,620
needs some help.

205
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,980
Hey, Adam, Jesse, and you can't hear you, I say, thinking about the last C had C I heard

206
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,980
and had a few things to say about it.

207
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,260
First of all, that log me in services, like in way cool, mm-hmm.

208
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,660
But because there's something like that to, uh, to help my mother, who, often needs health

209
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,660
points.

210
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,300
That's exactly what everyone is saying.

211
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,340
Everyone says, yeah, man, it was great because, um, my sister, my dad, my mother, my wife,

212
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,380
whatever, you know, she really needs, he, she, it really needs help.

213
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,220
And now, from anywhere you have a web browser, you can just connect to the thing.

214
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,300
It's, uh, and they should be paying me for that.

215
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,300
I should shut up.

216
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,580
And, uh, at least in the evening for me to get to our house and having something like that,

217
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:06,060
uh, it just works, it's beautiful when something works and it's free to go to home.

218
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,660
I was thinking about, that's a new to a power issue, mm-hmm.

219
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,380
And the seeds, the green seeds you're talking about, man.

220
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,620
They were talking about, uh, uh, was it something, uh,

221
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,380
who'd be your rod Adams called in.

222
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,940
We were talking about, uh, new power in the UK.

223
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,620
I'm not quite sure we talked about the green fees, so please do, do carry on.

224
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,140
Here in the state of New Hampshire in the US, uh, uh,

225
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,860
I honestly don't understand them all, but we're, I pay $100 a year and some sort of

226
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,860
nuclear decommissioning fees, uh, presumably something to do with the, uh,

227
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,100
because of power plants and seafood in New Hampshire, but for again, hey, man.

228
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:48,700
I, I, I'm paying my, uh, decommissioning something that's still operating,

229
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,500
and I'm still paying my bill on top of that.

230
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,780
That's pretty crazy.

231
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,380
Is that, uh, is that from the, uh, from the state government, and they're asking

232
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,940
you to pay these decommissioning fees, or is that on your energy bill, like, kind of like the

233
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:06,700
airlines will put on a special quote, tax for, uh, fuel surcharge, which is basically just

234
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,020
you paying directly for their cost of doing business, is that, uh, where's it coming from?

235
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,460
Who's billing you for that stuff?

236
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:18,140
Um, so sort of on that note of energy, I'm a guy that works for an oil company, and I'm

237
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,740
going to work in my hybrid car, uh, sort of interesting.

238
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,740
So I was thinking a good topic, um, sort of in the old vein of topics she had, like,

239
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,780
the Metro sexual home, it might be, uh, cars and car tech and, and gadgets.

240
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,660
I think that's a cool one of the discussions, um, I'd be interested to hear, for example,

241
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,820
how other people are listening to this, see if they're in their cars, and what sort of

242
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,940
tech is going on.

243
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:48,380
So might just be some good gadgets discussions, where I, I, I, I think that, uh, gadgets and

244
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:54,220
car talk would fit in line with your, your audience, make up, I think, anyway, maybe I'll just

245
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,620
Yeah, I appreciate the thought.

246
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,740
I, I don't know about that.

247
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,140
First of all, I don't really give a shit about cars anymore.

248
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,660
Um, I, I just don't, it's just the, I don't know.

249
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,980
It happened, uh, probably, you know what had happened when Patricia sold on my cars?

250
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,100
That's what, that's what, that's what had happened.

251
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,580
I have that on, uh, on, on video.

252
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,260
I actually actually put that up.

253
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,700
She sold every single one of them.

254
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,140
She said she was sick and tired of it.

255
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,580
And she was getting rid of all my cars.

256
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,820
It actually, she left the, uh, the outie at the time.

257
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,340
I should dig that up.

258
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,540
Okay, then, mode itself.

259
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:28,060
By the way, um, I, I wouldn't mind knowing who a little bit more about you guys, because,

260
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,220
you know, you're talking about the audience make up of the show.

261
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,580
I think we've pretty much ruled out the fact that any women listen.

262
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,700
So it's just us guys.

263
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,140
What are we, are we like middle aged, uh, middle class, guys?

264
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,380
Is that, is that what we are?

265
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,060
Is that who, I mean, it's okay because, um, we're the ones under the most pressure in the

266
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,700
United States.

267
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,940
Okay, granted, I'm upper middle class, but that's just, uh, because I've been around

268
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:56,140
longer than most of you fuckers, uh, had some time to build up a little, uh, a little nest egg.

269
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,180
But, uh, where the ones that are driving the economy, where the ones that get squeezed,

270
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,300
is, is that it?

271
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,020
Is that us?

272
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,060
So, you know, maybe now, uh, you let me know how old you are.

273
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,740
Um, or just say, uh, yeah, this is it.

274
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,580
So I'd say, uh, love you.

275
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,580
I mean, if I can remember it all.

276
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,340
Uh, love you, mean it, great hair.

277
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,420
Hope you win 43 middle class.

278
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,180
Something like that.

279
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,660
Now, maybe not.

280
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,700
podcasting.

281
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:58,860
I need to have no idea in, uh, actual bandwidth, how much I'm using, um, as a heavy, uh, podcast listener,

282
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:05,500
but it's got me thinking that I could in the future be seeing a very large bill.

283
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,100
You know, uh, and this is good.

284
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,620
Uh, I've been thinking about talking about this for a while and I appreciate you calling in

285
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,460
with that, Mr. No last name.

286
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,620
Um, so this is apparently a trial that time Warner, uh,

287
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,780
cable is doing in Beaumont, Texas.

288
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,380
And you can laugh about Beaumont, Texas, but I've been to Beaumont, Texas, okay?

289
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,940
I have been to a roadhouse in Beaumont, Texas, which is, you know,

290
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,420
that's all the story because I never get to talk about Beaumont.

291
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,220
At the time, I had, uh, Adam Curry's top 30 hit list.

292
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,420
It was a syndicated top, you know, basically a countdown show on the radio,

293
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,020
syndicated throughout the U.S.

294
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,620
And one of the stations, I forget the actual station, but it was in Beaumont, Texas.

295
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,420
And, um, you know, um, from time to time, I'd go visit the stations.

296
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,580
Usually around the time they had their summer jam or some other, you know,

297
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,940
thing where not just me, but a whole bunch of artists would come in.

298
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,220
Usually, you know, track artists.

299
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,540
So, uh, you got to think of, uh, Marky Mark and the funky bunch, you know,

300
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,380
so no, no, no musicians or typically no musicians, just, you know,

301
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,340
pure dat tape playing in the singing and dance and on stage.

302
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,300
And I would introduce them and, you know, participate in the summer jam,

303
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,740
everybody, Beaumont, Texas.

304
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,940
And so I arrived in Beaumont, which does have its own, uh,

305
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,460
it does have its own airport.

306
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,420
And I was picked up, uh, I'm trying to think the name of the club,

307
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:26,220
but the radio station, uh, pick me up in, uh, in a pink Cadillac convertible.

308
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,780
And I swear to God, with the big long horn on the front.

309
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,860
I mean, it was completely authentic.

310
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,700
And the gig was at this roadhouse.

311
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,740
And literally, if you've seen the movie roadhouse where there's chicken wire up on this,

312
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,620
on this, uh, and front of the stage and the stage is really elevated about shoulder height

313
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,940
off of the ground, that's the gig.

314
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:49,660
And it was necessary because, you know, it got pretty fraughty and crunchy on the, on the floor.

315
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,820
But I'll never forget because of this stage being so high up, uh,

316
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,020
there were these fans on the ceiling ceiling fans.

317
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,380
And, um, you know, if you were basically on the stage, you were, you know, pretty close to the

318
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,180
ceiling. I'm not, not like, uh, you know, I'd say probably about a meter,

319
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,700
yeah, about three feet, uh, from, uh, from the, from the ceiling fans.

320
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,580
And I remember it was, um, uh, EMF.

321
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,900
Remember those guys? You're unbelievable.

322
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,540
And they were unbelievable. They were just out of their mind, you know, that, that was such an explosive

323
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,220
track. And I think it was pretty much all they did, uh, at least that I can remember.

324
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,020
And at one point, you know, you may have heard this.

325
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,660
Oh, I should look this on, I'll be able to go to the, oh, down, down, to, down, to, and the guy gets

326
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:37,500
up on, um, a piano stool. And jumps into the air. Yeah, you guessed it.

327
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,980
His head went right into the fucking ceiling fan. It was, it was quite a trip.

328
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:50,140
Excuse me. Anyway, so Beaumont, Texas, they got a real airport. They got real, uh, uh,

329
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,900
people who enjoy popular music. They got internet. So that's where they're testing this thing out.

330
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,500
You know what? I think it's a great idea. Excuse me. That's the morning call.

331
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,340
I think the idea of meter band with this good. The question, of course, is what are we going to

332
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,220
charge for it? I think right now, if you were to actually measure what most people are using in

333
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,980
bandwidth and what they're being charged, you're being overcharged right now. Now, not, that's not to

334
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,620
say that there's, you know, that there's tons of people who use the same pricing. And of course,

335
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:26,220
they're downloading a lot more. Um, they may have, uh, some peer-to-peer programs running. I mean,

336
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:33,340
this is a lot more used of, uh, of bandwidth. And, and obviously, it's very, very difficult for, um,

337
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:40,380
for, uh, ISPs to manage all this traffic, particularly with video traffic. And, you know, I'm not,

338
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,860
you know, sucking up to the big man here. I think I'm just being very realistic because I do know a lot

339
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,660
about how, how traffic is routed and what it takes. And particularly what it costs, because it is just

340
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:55,660
not free. Now, here's what's interesting. By the way, I like the 4-pay model. And I would say,

341
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:01,260
you know, just make it, uh, you know, make it meet it all the way, you know, like, like your phone

342
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:08,620
system, uh, like, uh, like so many things. Um, what I like about the payment is kind of like, um,

343
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,860
like the supermarket, you know, where you get the, uh, you get the supermarket, the shopping cart,

344
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,260
but you have to stick a quarter or in the UK appound. You have to stick a pound into the,

345
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,900
into the little thing for it to unlock from the, uh, from the other, uh, carts from the other

346
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,340
shopping carts. Now, it's only a quarter or pound in, in, as the case may be. And it's not about

347
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:35,660
you stealing the cart. It's about you bringing the cart back. So it's cleaned up. That saves so much

348
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,060
money and aggravation and hassle for everybody. Because, you know, it's, you know, you just do, you want

349
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,340
your money back. You know, and it's like, uh, for the pound. Yeah, I'm not going to let some other

350
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,100
smuck it in my pound. I'm going to put the, the cart back in the, in the nice little row. I want

351
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:54,460
to get my pound out. So I, I'd like the, um, the psychological effect paying for something has

352
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:01,180
on, uh, on people. Now, I think that we're probably overpaying as it is because I know that on the

353
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:07,340
other end, when I'm sending ban without, when we're, because we pay for ban with to send you the podcast.

354
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:16,700
So it's a really valid question. Um, for each giga bite transferred, right? Um, we, uh, I can't,

355
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,900
I'm not allowed to tell you the exact price, but it's less than nine cents per gigabyte. Okay,

356
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,020
significantly. Um, and nine cents is pretty much the norm for anyone who's pushing a lot of

357
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:32,700
volume. You can get at least, uh, I'd say a lot of people are around 25 cents, but you know, we

358
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,940
push so much and the more we push the cheaper it gets, which is the way I believe it should be.

359
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:43,180
If I'm a huge user of ban with at home, I should be paying less for, you know, for the,

360
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,380
for the overage that I use. So it's the, it's all going to come down to the accounting. Um,

361
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,340
and obviously, you know, it's, they're not going to, I just can't believe that any company with

362
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:58,620
any brains is going to try and charge you $200 at the end of the month because you use 10 gigabytes

363
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:05,580
of information, uh, excuse me, uh, because it won't fly and then someone else will come in with cheaper

364
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:12,780
rates. But that is, that is kind of the industry standard cost of a gigabyte of, of data transfer.

365
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:18,380
Now, granted, if you go to Akamai or some other content delivery network today, and you say,

366
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,380
all right, how much you're going to charge me? They'll probably start off at $1.25 per gigabyte

367
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,580
transferred. So, you know, just by telling him fuck you, you'll get it down to 75 cents. But then

368
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,060
the rest has really got to come out of volume. Um, so I can actually see where almost like a

369
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:38,060
price line.com. You could pool your, your bandwidth usage together, buy and bulk, and then distribute

370
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,980
that cheaper to the people who are part of the system. I think that really will work because it

371
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:47,180
gives everyone a fair shake and everyone's basically paying for what they're using. But the four

372
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,940
pay model, the meter bandwidth will not work at today's prices, which actually are kind of expensive.

373
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,980
Does that make any sense? Uh, I'm hoping I'm starting off a debate here. Well, from the book, I drive

374
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:17,660
time podcast and the tone ranger. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Yeah,

375
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:23,180
hi. This is a message for a Jose Martinez. Mr. Martinez. This is Bonnie from Eagle Appraisal Service

376
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:29,500
for writer insurance company, or steer motor. All of us this are number 73. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

377
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:35,340
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What the hell is that? Two, two, four, four, five, four, one. Thank you.

378
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:43,020
That's clearly a wrong number. Oh, man. Let's see. Who's this then?

379
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:49,340
Adam, I have Charles. Charles. He's over for January. London. I'm very good my friend. Not Charles,

380
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:54,060
the drunken Londoner, but sober for January only, but he is Charles, our friend from London.

381
00:24:54,060 --> 00:25:00,700
I've been away quite some time. Yeah, and do I can show that is? Because I'm an easy. And also,

382
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:08,460
the lovely, it like what you gave me has just stopped working. However, I'd saved up and I went out and bought

383
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:15,580
myself an iPhone yesterday. Oh, I do with a max book as well since saving hard. Charles, I can't believe

384
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:22,220
you didn't go out and get a Nokia N8010 with my 15% discount. Well, you needed a file. That's right.

385
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,860
It didn't your car get broken into and your laptop and all kinds of, maybe it was. Yeah, I think it was

386
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,260
you. Did all your shit get stolen, man? Anyway, good to have you back on the scene, Charles. What

387
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,820
you got for me? And I'm loving them. So, I've just been listening to the latest show. Don't know

388
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,860
the note which it was on this iPhone. My first podcast on the iPhone. My second phone call on the

389
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:48,060
iPhone. In fact, excellent. Someone made a comment. I hope Patricia is recovering well.

390
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:54,940
So, we're having a bit of wait for a long time. I have no idea what that comment was about.

391
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:00,780
But I just thought I'd drop you a line and say, I also wish Patricia well. I hope that nothing

392
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:10,620
serious has happened. And, you know, good hair. Well, I hope you win. Yeah, that's sweet to your

393
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:16,060
Charles. Yeah, no, it was a appendicitis that Patricia had been walking around with for a year,

394
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,580
completely misdiagnosed. We caught it in time. And she went back to the doctor. She's in her recuperation phase.

395
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:28,060
She's almost back to normal. And the doctor said, you are lucky because it would not have been

396
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,140
much like. It could have happened at any moment, basically. She could have, it could have ruptured in.

397
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:37,660
Let me tell you, you got more than just a little blowhole of an entry wound there. If that happens,

398
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,500
then you're going to rip you all the way open. So, she's very lucky. We're very happy. And even

399
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,500
though, she's still healing. She is so, oh man, she's so happy about just having this pain gone.

400
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,380
This alien has been taken out of her, which is not, you know, she says that. It's funny because

401
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:59,500
reminds me because when my mom was very sick before she passed, she also had a really nasty tumor

402
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:05,020
and they had removed it once. And she also spoke of the alien. So, it was a very weird time for us.

403
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,820
In fact, I'm making sure she goes to visit her mom and her sister to chew out a little bit.

404
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,500
Because of course, you know my wife, right? She's walking around. She's still healing, you know?

405
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,820
And she just can't leave stuff alone. She has to have someone else take care of her. And of course,

406
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:24,460
so, you know, I can only, I guess I can only do so much. Okay, I've just noticed something here

407
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:30,140
on the Ableton Live. By the way, I will post this screenshot. I'm using it in combination with

408
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,860
something called SoundBite, which is another Mac program, which basically lets you

409
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,500
put a whole bunch of sound files into racks. So, you can kind of fire them off. Very analogous to

410
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,740
what Casplaster does for the PC. But I'm noticing on Ableton, I can't actually see how long I've

411
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:52,700
been recording for this. The time, I'm sure there's a way to, there must be a way to

412
00:27:52,700 --> 00:28:01,660
to get the time scale here. Is it 194 something that I've been 194, I can't be minutes,

413
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:08,060
crap, I gotta figure this thing out. I do like this, this live thing because

414
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,100
you look at it for the first time and you look at the interface and you go,

415
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,900
man, that looks dumb. It looks like something out of Tron. You know, it looks like real

416
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:23,580
70s colors. It's not that typical, what do you call it? You know, the typical beautiful

417
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:29,580
rendering of a 24 track mixing board and all the knobs are really rendered beautifully,

418
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:35,420
quite the opposite. And I understand why now, because in programs like like a

419
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:42,460
logic studio, logic studio pro or whatever it is, which has all those beautiful interfaces,

420
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,380
there's latency that you can't get rid of and this thing, you could actually control the latency.

421
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:52,540
If I wanted to, I could actually delay myself or delay any tracking, there's all kinds of stuff in

422
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:58,700
here. I think Richard Blusty also uses this program and there's all kinds of routing, so tomorrow

423
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:05,820
on Friday, I'll be able to test the routing from the microphone and from the audio tracks

424
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,620
back in the Skype without feeding Skype back into it. For those of you who have tried that out,

425
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:16,460
you'll know what I'm talking about. When we do another no agenda show. Okay, let me see,

426
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:22,140
it's, I can kind of see the time. It's been about 22 minutes. So let's,

427
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:29,820
um, oh, when we do something sexy for Thursday, early Thursday morning.

428
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,380
Let's bring in Chuck, of course, who was hooked me up with my Grokha Kirstie Hawkshaw, Chuck.

429
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:44,060
I told my dad Adam's DSU 712. That was over the time. Yeah, you like that? That was excellent. Thank you.

430
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:52,060
Then that was just out of control anytime. Anytime. So hey, uh, I launched you a little link

431
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:59,740
for a vid to check. Um, you remember, uh, DRAMs, the show for back in the day, uh,

432
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,940
Kirstie did this awesome remake with, uh, guide of Salt Lake City by the name of Sleep Thief,

433
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,100
and they did a video as well. I didn't see it, man. You guys? I said I'm near in the email from

434
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,740
you need to resend the to me. And I didn't see that. I'd love to see that. I'll have to look again.

435
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,740
Of course, my email is hoes because it's just so much coming in. Please resend. Well, actually,

436
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:23,500
get a check. Hey, and I just had an inspired thought, um, you know, I was a avid listener of

437
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:29,500
uh, Natalie Doganti and uh, texture. Yeah. I mean, I loved it. Yes, she was, she was just a sweet

438
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:36,140
her to live room, you're on the show. And, um, you know, I don't know what your plans are for, um,

439
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:43,180
for fill in her shoes or, or if you're looking to fill her shoes, but, uh, holy cow, you know,

440
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:48,540
I know where this is going. I'd show you K. She's a tech girl. She's a geeky girl. She's all

441
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:54,220
about music. You know, how Natalie was there at the plus TV award, mhm, mhm, mingling with all

442
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:59,660
the music types. I mean, Jesus, thirsty, you know, those are all those folks. You know,

443
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:04,140
I'm liking where this is going, Chuck. I'm like, you know, I, I, I, I, I'm always very careful

444
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,580
because she's very dedicated to her music and I don't want to get it on a different career path,

445
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:12,780
because she's really, really concentrated. Uh, but I am like, are you setting me up, man?

446
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:19,420
Are you hooked on me up with a personal meeting? I, um, if only I could find a female

447
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,660
British singer for this show I have in mind. And what she's a geeky girl, man? Yeah, there's

448
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:28,540
a girl. I don't, um, we have someone lined up for texture. Obviously, I think the cat is pretty

449
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:35,820
much out of the bag. It's, uh, Becky. I don't even want to say any more than that. Um, Becky's

450
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:41,020
awesome. The only problem with Becky is her timing. Uh, at the very moment, we actually wanted to

451
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,620
bring her in. Uh, she was about to drop, uh, twins, which I believe has happened. So I'll get

452
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:53,100
an update on that, uh, Becky Warley. Yeah, that's who we have slated, but um, I'm digging your idea

453
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,260
here, Chuck. And she's cool. Yeah, it's cool. So anyway, that's my inspired top for the day,

454
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:05,420
and a career you rock, uh, who comes once again, man. I love you. Me,

455
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:15,260
need it. Great, right here. I hope you win. Middle-aged middle class 43. There you go. Hey, the, um,

456
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:21,180
A, A, I, B, the Air Accident Investigation Branch in the UK has, uh, released an update on British

457
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:29,580
Airways, uh, flight 38. This is, uh, in addition to their January 17th update, it came in yesterday.

458
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,220
Um, and this is, it's quite interesting. Uh, so let me just get through the Blom Blom Blom Blom

459
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:39,100
Blom stuff. As previously reported, while the aircraft was stabilized on an iOS approach, which

460
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:43,740
means it was coming in on instruments, it was on the instrument landing system with autopilot

461
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:49,740
engaged. The autoprust system commanded an increase in thrust from both engines. The engines

462
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:57,020
both initially responded after about three seconds. The thrust of the right engine reduced some

463
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:02,140
eight seconds later, the thrust reduced on the left engine to a similar level. This is interesting,

464
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:06,860
because, um, although I've never flown a triple seven, I'm pretty sure that if, um, if both

465
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:13,020
engines, uh, they throttled up, but then the right engine reduced after about three seconds, that plane

466
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,300
is going to veer off course. So that could have set a whole bunch of things into motion, which, um,

467
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,860
uh, you know, certainly the pilot would have probably disengaged the autopilot at that point

468
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:27,820
and taken over manual control, because it'd be, uh, ready to miss the runway, not not coming

469
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:33,020
up short, but left or right, just missing it, which could have also affected his, um, his glide path

470
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:39,020
on the speed and, and could have, um, you know, um, negatively impacted the glide that he was trying

471
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,740
to put into, make a, a smoother landing than what to, took place. So some eight seconds later,

472
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,660
the thrust reduced on the left engine to a similar level. The engines did not shut down,

473
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:54,460
and both engines continued to produce thrust at an engine speed above flight idle, but less than

474
00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:00,460
the commanded thrust. Very interesting, uh, which means, you know, uh, obviously you're still

475
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:05,660
going to kind of come up short, but with this, uh, um, with the difference between the engines,

476
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:11,020
that could have really screwed up the glide path. So all possible scenarios that could explain

477
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,180
the thrust reduction and continued lack of response to the engines to throttle lever, inputs are

478
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:20,620
being examined in close cooperation with Boeing, Rolls Royce, British Airways. Interesting. I love the

479
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:26,300
fact that these guys are setting out, uh, all of these updates. That's, uh, that's something the, uh,

480
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:31,100
the NTSP, I don't think they do that do it that way. And, uh, and it's important because we need to

481
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:38,780
all of these aircraft are safe or not. All right. Um, let's do, um, no, um, you know, tomorrow,

482
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,940
which I may tape tonight, we got to get deep into some stuff like the Fed. We've got all kinds

483
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:50,380
of banking stuff going crazy. Uh, we had this rogue trader, uh, who, um, at the, um, what's the,

484
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:55,500
the French bank? Hmm, I can't remember the name of the, uh, I probably have it written down here.

485
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,500
A whole lot of my notes. It's another thing I got to set up. I'll tell you about the second

486
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:04,220
hold on. Let me just see what the rest of the new stories are. No, I didn't even put it in there.

487
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:09,820
Anyway, something like, uh, almost five billion pounds that they're writing off. It's like seven,

488
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:18,220
seven or eight billion dollars. A rogue trader. Yeah. I'd say, um, you know what I'm missing?

489
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,740
And this is the thing that I am going to see if I can score that while I'm out here.

490
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,540
Is I want to control surface? And what that is, because now of course, I don't have a mixing board

491
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,500
and even, uh, with my previous setup, I have a mixer so I can control the levels and

492
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,900
and twist them with my left hand while I'm doing all of the selecting of what I'm playing with my

493
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:42,060
right hand on the computer. Uh, but of course, now I only have one control input for both function.

494
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,700
So I need a control surface, which has some sliders and a control surface, basically all it does is it

495
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:53,500
just sends MIDI commands to the program so that I can then map these, uh, these volume, uh,

496
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:58,940
faders, these sliders, as you might recognize them, uh, to the individual channel. So, uh,

497
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,620
I'd be able to train, you know, to fade my mic up and down. I'll be able to mix this on the

498
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:08,140
sounds a little bit better. Uh, it's just a lot of stuff I got to work on. All right. I do have

499
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:13,900
one more song, which came to us from a mashuptown.com, which is so beautiful for a Thursday morning

500
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:20,220
where the sun is just coming up in San Francisco. It's just raising up over the bed. I think you'll

501
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:25,260
like this one. It'll get you into that mood by the bay, everybody.

502
00:36:50,220 --> 00:37:00,740
Where do we go?

503
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:09,720
Go no no. Oh each day gets better. I just came, everybody.

504
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:16,720
It's kiss, kiss, we are, I just can't leave her now.

505
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:49,720
The年ning goes with love that you wrote Yes, there is love in you

506
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:57,720
We'll never lose what is true, if it's so wrong, who's shining away

507
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,720
Looking and everything remain still in the sea

508
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Will we go on even more?

509
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:15,720
Oh, you know, when each day is better, I just can't leave her alone.

510
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,720
Oh, no, each kiss gets sweeter.

511
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,720
I just can't leave her alone.

512
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,720
I just can't leave her alone.

513
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,720
Oh, I don't want to live without her.

514
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Oh, man, how pretty is that, huh?

515
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Fwager who loving you better.

516
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,720
Those in the know will recognize mini-ripperton and John Legend.

517
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,720
Brought to you by mashuptown.com.

518
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,720
Oh, what a great track that is.

519
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Love you.

520
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
Love you.

521
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,720
Love you.

522
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
Love you.

523
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
Love you.

524
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
Love you.

525
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
Love you.

526
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
Love you.

527
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,720
Love you.

528
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,720
Love you.

529
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Love you.

530
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
Love you.

531
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
And that is love it.

532
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,040
Hey, it's almost seven o'clock now.

533
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,720
And that means it's time for our sales call.

534
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,720
So I'm going to get on the phone with the sales Present.

535
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,720
Let me know what you thought of the sound if it works for you.

536
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,720
Obviously, I still got some bugs to work out, some kinks and stuff.

537
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,720
But I think overall I'm pretty pleased and all the still lot more experimentation to go through.

538
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,700
Whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop,

539
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,900
told you about the N800's.

540
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:32,480
Of course, go Daddy, if you want an awesome deal on a domain name, in fact, you can't get

541
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,440
better anywhere else.

542
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,920
There's a couple of code you can use all the DSC, DSC12 or three.

543
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,820
The standard one, DSC3 is if you just want to get a domain name, real quick down, down

544
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:46,380
and dirty cheap for 695, DSC3 is your checkout code.

545
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,040
Atomoodpodshow.com, dailystorescode.com, I will get the show notes together, of course,

546
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,640
that's another part of the process, that is not as streamlined as with cast blaster.

547
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,960
So I got to figure out how that works and what the heck?

548
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
Love you, mean it.

549
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,040
Great hair, hope you win, live life with passion

550
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
and enjoy your freedom.

551
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,760
I'll talk to you tomorrow for the Fubar Friday.

552
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,760
Bye, everybody.

553
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,000
Another Pajo podcast.

554
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,400
Stick it in your ear.

555
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,400
I'll talk to you tomorrow for the Fubar Friday.
