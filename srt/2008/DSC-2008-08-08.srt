1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
Daily source code, episode number 781, my fellow chuckleheads, brothers and sisters.

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,720
Today we're going to do something entirely different for the footballer Friday edition

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,720
of the Daily source code.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,280
We start with what will hopefully be the first in a series of something I'm calling Confessions

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,000
of a multimedia hitman, barred of course from the eye-opening, expose confessions of

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,040
an economic hitman by the courageous John Perkins.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,000
His book was an important piece to the puzzle that I've been assembling over the course

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,800
of the past six months.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,600
So my borrowing, the nucleus of his title is intended to be attributed as well as a contribution

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,760
to the dismantling of the machine.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,800
Now I say it's been a six-month excursion, but the process has actually something that's

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,640
been taking place my entire life.

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,920
Very much like one of those tabletop jigsaw puzzles that we used to put together as kids.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,720
My mom, of course, always taught me once you've got the corners and the sides squared away,

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,640
the rest just kind of falls into place with exponential ease.

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,480
So the people that make up this community, that's you listening right now, have mostly been

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,760
along for this ride of mine, unknowingly, despite this though you've certainly been my

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,800
wingmen and have kept me safe throughout and it's highly appreciated.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,400
I hope for you to understand what I mean by that as I move on through the story.

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,560
Okay, so now that I've baited you with that intro, you probably feel you deserve an explanation.

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,400
Well, you're right, and we're going to talk about it right now.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,440
Imagine a world where you wake up one morning only to realize that everything you believe

23
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:36,000
in your reality, so to speak, functioned entirely differently from the way you've been

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,720
perceiving it all of your life.

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,320
A world in fact, where the truth is often the direct opposite of your reality, I'm going

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,120
to give you a second to chew on that one, which actually it's not too hard.

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:53,120
Our popular culture is inundated with this concept from the colorized awakening for Dorothea

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,480
and the Wizard of Oz to Neo's never ending battle with Mr. Smith and the Matrix.

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,320
Nothing is as it seems.

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
Take the red pill.

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,280
Follow the yellow brick road down the rabbit hole to unveil the man behind the curtain.

32
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,960
Then click your heels three times and say, there's no place like home, there's no place

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
like home.

34
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,760
I really love matching these two stories together, and the combination of the really

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,800
reflect the findings of my research.

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,080
So let's look at this for a second.

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,960
Dorothy and her friend's reality was a belief system that they had no courage, no heart,

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,720
no brain and worst of all, no home.

39
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,640
This reality was really bestowed upon them by the master of the universe, the Wizard of

40
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Oz, who is great and in control.

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,880
Of course, we know that through the sheer willpower and faith, this gang, Dorothy and

42
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,680
her friend's unmasked the wizard, only defined out that he's actually a pathetic little

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,560
man pulling all the levers behind the curtain.

44
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,600
So once the farce of the wizard is exposed, their reality changes and then their true

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,880
potential is returned to the including heart, brain, et cetera, and home.

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:07,040
Now in the Matrix, taking the red pill allows you to be decoupled from the machine that

47
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,880
kept you alive through the transmission of a computer generated world into your brain,

48
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,280
feeding you only the necessary nutrients in order to use your body as an energy source

49
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,480
to keep the machine running.

50
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,320
Hopefully you've seen both of these movies, if not, you should stop this now and go

51
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
take a look at them.

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,760
So thousands of hours of following conspiracy theories, reading ancient scripture,

53
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,280
painstakingly trying to understand truth and mathematics, watching and learning from

54
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,800
the research of thousands of others, has brought me on this numerically significant

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,160
day, of course, the 8th of the 8th of 2008, to pass on my findings to you.

56
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,920
My story is about power, three kinds of power, the power of our minds, the power of

57
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,800
rule, and the power as in what makes our lights glow and keeps our vehicles moving,

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,840
individually and collectively, these three forms of power all consist of energy.

59
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,480
So let's start off with the power of our brains.

60
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,120
The human body is a very sophisticated machine.

61
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,600
It functions autonomously.

62
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,240
It takes its instructions from the brain, which works a lot like your personal computer.

63
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,200
It has processes that run all the time in the background, like collecting your mail or

64
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,840
scanning for viruses, those kinds of processes.

65
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,440
It produces output in the form of light display, sound, and action, or movement, and it takes

66
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,640
input.

67
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,080
But instead of clunky keyboards, we've got major asthma, Joe, when it comes to our scanning

68
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,440
and processing ability.

69
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,920
But of course, I've get to see a demonstration of a computer that can read a play by Shakespeare.

70
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,840
Remember, then engage in audience with this portrayal of the story, taking external

71
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,560
cues from other, while in this case, it would be other computers, musical or lighting changes,

72
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,160
audience feedback.

73
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,560
But then again, I'll be the first to admit that the Honda robot walking up a flight of stairs

74
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,400
is quite an impressive start, but still not quite as cool as our built-in computers in our heads.

75
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,040
So frankly, we're pretty impressive straight out of the box.

76
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,120
We're designed to be programmed.

77
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,240
We can execute programs on command or in the background.

78
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,560
It's all a part of our learning function.

79
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,960
You don't need like a C compiler for this.

80
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,280
It's much easier to program the human brain.

81
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,880
In fact, from a very early age, we get programmed by input stimuli and repetition,

82
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,760
those two things, input and repetition.

83
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,720
And of course, that's done until a program is running properly, at which point we move on to learning

84
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,440
something new.

85
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,280
Copping our parents is how we learn to communicate as one example.

86
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,200
Looking both ways before crossing the road is another program that is essential to our safety,

87
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,600
and is either taught over time by repetition from our parents or other programmers,

88
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:51,080
like teachers or other family members, or it could be programmed into your brain by a shock

89
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,360
to the input system, such as narrowly being avoided being hit by an oncoming car,

90
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,680
or maybe being hit if you survive it.

91
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,320
The shock treatment embeds a lot of information deep into the system,

92
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,440
and the next time we receive input that we're about to cross a road,

93
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,160
that program will be automatically recalled and executed.

94
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,280
Pavlov proved the working of this program ability over 100 years ago

95
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,560
with his dogs and their salivating.

96
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,080
You can Google it.

97
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,840
If you want to program a person to react in a specific manner, to a specific input,

98
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,240
all you have to do is continuously repeat the input instructions,

99
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,840
and if possible, provide a reward when the person reacts with the desired action.

100
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,800
So today I'm convinced that the process of learning code written for us in this manner,

101
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,360
executing it uses only a tiny fraction of our full processing capability.

102
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,560
If our true brain potential is the world's most powerful supercomputer,

103
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,200
then we are right now still in the equivalent of the advocacy age with a knowledge of what this

104
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,920
gray matter between our ears is actually capable of.

105
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,800
As I just said before, at any time, if you feel the need, just stop,

106
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,760
to stop this show, obviously, if you can, and Google for any more information.

107
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,920
Just type your full question into Google.

108
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,160
Google knows exactly where to send you because all your questions have already been asked and answered.

109
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,880
Many times over, I know I've done the research.

110
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,960
So throughout our evolution, regardless of how we came to be,

111
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,760
we have evolved our thinking processes.

112
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,800
Our communication skills and our self-awareness.

113
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,560
This is always reflected in our technology and, of course, that's what people are digging up tools,

114
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,600
right? That's what you always see. So let's focus on power as an energy that makes our world

115
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,800
function, specifically electricity. And now you'll definitely want to Google Nikola Tesla.

116
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,080
He was instrumental in bringing electricity to our civilization more than a century ago, the generator,

117
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,800
alternating current, the Niagara Falls power plant, radio wave transmission, the

118
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,400
Bobbin in your car, all Tesla inventions without power or energy.

119
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,560
You wouldn't be, you wouldn't be listening to this show.

120
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Poof, no PC, no internet, no toothbrush, no motorized vehicles.

121
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,480
If only we had an unlimited supply of electricity, then everything would be just perfect, but we don't.

122
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,680
Humanity instead was directed down to path of creating energy from pieces of the earth itself,

123
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,720
instead of the energy that it already consists of.

124
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,040
Let me take you back to the Wizard of Oz. So we've got a cunning, sad little man, apparently,

125
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,400
he figured out a way to be in control or in power, if you will, of the whole land.

126
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,760
Because it was the Wizard behind the curtain who was pulling all the levers,

127
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,960
remember that, creating repetitive illusions that enforce Dorothy and her friends into believing

128
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:48,120
that they needed to stay on the path on the Yellow Brigroad. And psychologically abused them

129
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,040
into believing that they weren't worthy because of their so-called deficiencies,

130
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,440
which didn't even exist in the first place. The Wizard created a reality, a program of code

131
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,240
that was executed by pulling levers that created scary inputs to the group's on-board

132
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,680
processors in effect, enslaving them to his every command. So how does this translate

133
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,320
to 2008? As a businessman, I can easily see how compelling it would be to have control over

134
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,480
the world's energy. I mean, it's even more powerful than controlling the world's money, right,

135
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,680
because everything all starts with energy. So in the context of the world, the beginning of the

136
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,360
20th century, the concept of keeping the world on the path on the Yellow Brigroad by using my

137
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,280
form of energy would be a very nifty proposition indeed. And of course, the best way to undertake

138
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,960
this mission, you know, the 80 years ago or whatever, would be to start with a lot of money in the first place.

139
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,520
So at this point in my story, the research that I did let me down many paths from the illuminati

140
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:55,320
to reptilian bloodlines to UFOs, planet X, there are many historical research paths to explore.

141
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,880
I don't really recommend it, mainly because it really doesn't matter at this point. Following

142
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,560
the money, though, which is easy to trace leads to the true owners of the world. It's just a handful

143
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,720
of families who control the resources that powered our world, which I'll just call these people

144
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,880
the energy elite. The names are instantly recognizable. You can easily connect all petroleum-based

145
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,720
energy sources to names like Rockefeller, Rothschild, or JP Morgan. In fact, it was JP himself,

146
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,240
who was one of the Tesla's original investors and acquired many of his energy patents,

147
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:35,000
which formed a foundation for an energy empire. Now, when you think about it, that really hasn't

148
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
been much in the way of evolution in electricity since Tesla 100 years ago. Yes, you're the

149
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,880
some significant enhancements certainly for storage, but in general, no innovation.

150
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:53,560
My conclusion is that energy innovation, particularly Tesla's, was stifled in lieu of this new

151
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:59,560
black gold that would power the generators to create a world of energy and motion based on oil.

152
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,200
Okay, fast forward to the Matrix movie, where a world's generated for us, remember that right

153
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,640
from a computer simulation, injected into our nervous system and our central processing brain cells.

154
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,800
So in the movie, we're actually hardwired into the system. It's not likely, of course,

155
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,000
the one day we're going to wake up and find ourselves attached to tubes and a tank of

156
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,120
from elder hide. And it's also unnecessary because it can be implemented wirelessly this type of

157
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,480
reality world or virtual reality, if you think about it. The most significant wireless input

158
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,600
device we have is our eyes. We also have four other sensory inputs to use. So, you know,

159
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,440
when an illusionist makes his assistant levitate or maybe you saw David Copperfield

160
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,000
make the great wall of China disappear, we see the illusion. And of course, we're baffled by it,

161
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,280
but we know that it's a trick because of the context of being aware that we're watching

162
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:58,120
a magic show. However, if you show the simple act of making fire from a match to an

163
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,200
digitist tribe that's never met any other kind of human being, of course, you'll instantly

164
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:11,480
be either loved like a god or feared like one. Media, in particular television, is a trick.

165
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,760
If you want to see how effective this box of tricks really is, please Google the Zen TV experiment

166
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,480
I've talked about this for years. Really, it's like they'll take a half an hour, maybe try it out.

167
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:31,160
It's an incredible eye opener. And I know because I was a multimedia hitman, a member of the

168
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:37,720
deception device that was hijacked by the energy elite to program your brain so you'll be a functional

169
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,720
piece of the gears that make their machine work. Not that I was ever aware of my role, of course,

170
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,640
the time, as are most people who work in mainstream media, it's baked into the DNA of media

171
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:55,320
companies. It wasn't until late 2001 that I realized my task was not actually to bring

172
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,320
cool music videos and juvenile fun to masses of teenagers, quite the contrary. I was merely meant

173
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:08,200
to keep the enslaved entertained until the next commercial break. I participated in

174
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,960
pressuring you or your kids, maybe, to buy products like Nutrigina, Skittles, Budweiser.

175
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,520
If you don't use this product, you'll have horrible acne and you'll never get laid.

176
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,120
Hey, be cool, drink, Budweiser. All the cool kids are doing it. You don't want to be a loser,

177
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:29,240
do you? You ain't got the thing. You don't got no bling. You need more stuff. Buy more stuff.

178
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,640
Need to borrow money? No problem. American Express can help. That is good. Buying stuff is even

179
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,880
better. Mx by the way, was the original owner of MTV before they later sold it to Viacom,

180
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,040
selling debt to kids. So once you understand television's true hypnotic mission, it becomes

181
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,160
easy to see how MTV could shamelessly drop their core music-based programming for complete

182
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:57,640
mindless exploitative programming. Laura Minwinder, young, shown heroes who measure their success

183
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,920
by the size of their crib or the pinpage of their ride, having ready to be pre-programmed shop

184
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,120
a hollocks by the time they're ready for their own super sweet 16. Then, of course, Tia Tequila

185
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,800
takes over to introduce to these fresh new human robots, the concept of sexual exploitation.

186
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,000
Obviously, I'm exaggerating to a certain degree, but I hope you get the point.

187
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,640
Of course, I'm not condemning MTV or the people to work there or even the program for that matter.

188
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,640
Unfortunately, you'll find that programming format of most mainstream media follows the same

189
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:36,600
principles, creating a reality in our minds that is a servant of the energy elites agenda and

190
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,680
it's working. What used to be called a human interest piece in the news 25 years ago,

191
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:48,120
that's now evolved into a culture of insatiable craving for celebrity gossip. It's been woven

192
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,960
into the fabric of all media. Just as an aside, you're going to hear me use the term programming

193
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:00,120
in the context of a computer to run a software program, as well as programming that consists

194
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,840
of the content transmitted to you, for instance, via television, radio, the internet. Both

195
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,280
consists of digital information. Both cases are intended to be input into the appropriate

196
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,160
computer processor, even a real computer processor, or your brain processor, to make the

197
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,520
machine perform an action or movement. Just like a computer program, I can write code to make

198
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,880
a PC, perform some action, a media programmer, and they call themselves programmers can create

199
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,080
content that will make your brain react in a predetermined manner. That in turn can trigger a

200
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:36,120
physical action in the body, like purchasing a product you saw advertised on television.

201
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:43,320
As shit really does work, you know? Of course, I promise. I'll elaborate more on this programming

202
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,720
and how to identify and protect yourself against it in future episodes of this series.

203
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,320
Which would just be a part of daily source code. We'll just keep on going with the source code numbers.

204
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,120
But once in a while, we'll do some different like this because if you really can,

205
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,840
figure out how it works and you understand that it becomes ineffective. Once you're aware of the code,

206
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,720
it can easily be barred from executing into your personal super computer brain.

207
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,760
And many of you who've been listening to the source code for a couple of years already know

208
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:16,280
how this works. Thousands still think of Senseo when you hear somebody burp, and I'm confident

209
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,600
many of you will think of Senseo when you gurgle your last breath on Earth and you're going to

210
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,360
curse me for it and I'm telling you, if an XVJ with a podcast can do that, imagine what people

211
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:33,240
with money and a plan could accomplish. The media distorts the truth almost by definition of words

212
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:39,880
like Edit, Cut, Zoom. Of course, we all saw the events on the fold of 9-11, right?

213
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:49,080
Or did we only see it on TV? If you truly believe what you saw televised on that day, then the television,

214
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,040
and everything else you see on it is your reality. Now this doesn't mean that what you saw is

215
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,360
either true or false, but it certainly cannot be compared to actually being at ground zero

216
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:04,120
seeing it happen. That is someone else's reality. If you're still following this, please paint

217
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,720
yourself on the back. You're probably already in a state of awakening. Now although electricity

218
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,280
in other forms of oil-based energy are the main tool of the energy elite with which to control

219
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,800
the masses over the decades they've built up an impressive infrastructure of government,

220
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:25,640
social and monetary systems that they control entirely. Their Wizard of Oz levers include

221
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,840
interest rates of central banks, aggregation of nations like the European Union to implement

222
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:37,320
bodies that hijack the democratic process, food and energy costs, and of course mass mainstream

223
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:43,480
media. All for the continued exploitation of us. Their slaves who they feed the bare minimum

224
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,760
and nutrients only to suck us dry of all of our true possessions are brain power and working

225
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:55,000
force. It's all for their benefit to continue building their wealth and power machine. That is

226
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,120
very much like the matrix, but it's just a metaphor. This perpetual system, however, has one fatal

227
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:08,760
flaw. It must continue to grow in order for it to survive. It's just like the corporations.

228
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,840
You look at the branch, you know what the tree's going to be like in vice versa.

229
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,920
Corporations need to grow in either two in order to survive, stagnation or blockage is lethal to it.

230
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,680
We actually were seeing proof of this in the current meltdown of the financial system,

231
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:28,120
which is in its pure essence, very easy to understand. Most people don't because it's presented

232
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,680
in the most confusing manner possible through the media. Only to be thrown, of course, into

233
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:38,600
the bit bucket by our brains. We're actually taught not to understand it. For if the source code

234
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:44,200
of the financial markets is truly understood, it's easy to see its vulnerability. It needs us,

235
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,080
the slaves to be indebted to it in order to prosper. The financial system is in meltdown

236
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,520
because its controllers took their eye off the ball. The machine was put into overdrive for too

237
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,400
long at overheated. Now, there's got nothing left to feed it with. Our physical presence cannot

238
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,520
be burdened with any more debt. That slows down parts of the machine like the banks who

239
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,880
in turn are interconnected to each other through their own debt system. This phantom money that

240
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,480
was created is finally being exposed for its true value. It's nothing more than a number in a

241
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,320
spreadsheet or a number written on a piece of paper. Once all of our houses, cars, and other

242
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,680
true physical stuff has been repossessed, there'll be no more meaning to the concept of money.

243
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,880
Remember that none of this machinery would ever have been created had free energy been available

244
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,320
to everyone. Even a century ago, the concept of free energy was considered a real day record

245
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,640
for the architects of the slave nation because free ain't no business model. Of course, it's entirely

246
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,960
possible that Tesla's concept of free energy does work and was kept from us. Just as it's possible

247
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,600
that extraterrestrial beings have brought technology to our planet only to have a concealed

248
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:02,840
from us by the energy elite. More likely, I think we are about to discover it ourselves.

249
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:08,680
Thanks to the evolution of our species. But even this discovery will not easily make it into the

250
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,720
consciousness of all the children of the world as most are still fully engaged in the multimedia

251
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,920
machine that is entertaining us to death. Perhaps it's the prophecy of the Mayans who predicted

252
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:24,360
an ascension of our awareness with the dawning of the age of Aquarius in 2012. I'm not ruling

253
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,960
out travelers from other worlds or dimensions who are assisting us, but I'm certain our DNA has

254
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,120
been divinely pre-programmed to evolve and due to centuries of suppression. Unleashing our full

255
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,840
potential could have an effect equal to the pressure relief of a champagne cork being popped out of

256
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:48,200
its container allowing its contents to spew out freely. There are many examples of higher consciousness

257
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:55,400
at work in our surroundings, particularly in our children. They're the next generation. The internet

258
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,480
was of course the elite's big cock-up. Since they themselves are stuck in ancient culture and

259
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:07,720
think they never saw the rapid evolution caused by a 24-7 interconnection of the enslaved populace.

260
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,640
Communities form produce useful tools, open source software is a great example of advanced

261
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,680
collaborative collaborating minds. Most contributors to Linux only know each other through email,

262
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,880
web, IRC, chat, and the source code management system that spits out software, which is far

263
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,880
superior to that offered by the elite in many ways. This program is another example of a product

264
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,640
created by collective minds. Social networks, wickies, blogs, Twitter, all tools we use together,

265
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,440
often to great benefit of the community that is using the tool. A look at the contributions

266
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,400
that come into drop.io slash daily source code, which is in turn is running on a system given to

267
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,360
this community, which is just us chuckle heads, but the people who developed drop.io. I don't

268
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,760
need to pay a producer to guess what you guys want to hear on their show. You actually upload it and

269
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:00,200
give it to me. I just glue it all together. No money ever changed hands anywhere. Except of course

270
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,280
for the money that needs to be fed into the machine somewhere down the line in order to get the

271
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:11,320
electricity to actually make it run. Just envision how much better and less restricted Google would be.

272
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,800
If they had free electricity to work with, they wouldn't need investors or shareholders,

273
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:22,680
possibly not even staff. We send audio and video in mere seconds around the globe.

274
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,160
Less than seconds. We have direct wireless communication through cell phones and text messages.

275
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:33,880
It really can't be too much of a leap to take these concepts to the next logical stage

276
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:41,800
of bypassing the analog inputs and controls like eyes, ears, and touch to one of mental transmission.

277
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,520
Everybody's witnessed some form of telepathy, perhaps with your partner or a family member.

278
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,240
If we don't have that kind of capacity, in the 99% of our brains, we don't know how to use yet,

279
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,360
then that would be an incredible waste of space up there in our heads. I simply cannot resolve

280
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:05,000
that who or what designed our beautiful body machinery wouldn't have added the required bits

281
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,240
to our brains to make us capable of infinite system upgrades. My recent experimentation with the

282
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:18,920
hydroxy booster, which you probably heard about on the show, it really depicts our current evolutionary

283
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:26,440
conundrum perfectly. Despite very smart people assuring me, this home-built concept of extracting

284
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:33,320
hydrogen from water and mixing it with a fuel supply that goes into my car cannot work due to the

285
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:40,360
laws of physics. I personally have been enjoying an average of 25% efficiency in fuel consumption.

286
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,440
They told me it could not work, I'm seeing it work, and I'm not alone. Thousands are experiencing

287
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,040
similar results worldwide. It almost no cost since the system is built with readily available material

288
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:58,520
and an endless supply of water. By now, of course, you understand why this fabulous invention

289
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,720
isn't plastered across the front pages and news programs globally. The energy elites just won't

290
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,160
allow it. Not that they have to hide these developments from anyone. They simply just don't allow

291
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,800
why distribution of the information unless it's packaged in a, that's crazy rapper.

292
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,960
It's far easier to hide a huge secret in plain sight than it is to cover up a lot of little ones

293
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,000
with secrecy. As my partner Ron taught me from his mainstream music production days,

294
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,680
if you can't cover it up, turn it up. As we continue our conversation in future episodes,

295
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,600
we'll talk more about the development of free energy by these brothers and sisters who've already

296
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,040
freed their minds from the machine. Their joe cells, their zero-point energy concepts,

297
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,600
built on the work of people like Tesla, will eventually lead us to our birthright. I'm convinced

298
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,680
at this point you've either declared me a complete loony tune or you might feel something familiar

299
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,960
about my story. Either way, most of you are still very much asleep in the reality created by

300
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:03,080
the masters that own us. Many of you are awakening, seeing the truth that lies within, identifying

301
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,200
the malicious code that comes out of us from all directions all intended to keep our machines working

302
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,920
for them. And so we live in duality. The elite's machine is creaking under the strain of

303
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:20,440
itself inflicted girth, while our intelligence has far surpassed the simple program set to

304
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,560
infinite loop that we've been running. And as always, it's all about the timing. If the machine

305
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,200
comes crumbling down, which seems as exactly what we're witnessing with the money meltdown,

306
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,320
enough of us need to be awake and prepared to take action. For those not awake, the shocker

307
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,400
of the machine's demise, I fear it will be too much to process in a short amount of time to be

308
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,400
useful to oneself in the world when it happens. I mean, taking me six months to go from

309
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,920
watching zeitgeist the movie to be able to articulate my story with you to you today. And that

310
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,800
is actually my role to assist in your awakening and to communicate as much learning as I can.

311
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:00,440
Now, I don't see an Armageddon arrival of graze, platings, tall blondes, the earth probably won't

312
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,920
come to a screeching halt, complete with tsunamis, earthquakes, and land mass relocation,

313
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,160
nor do I fear black helicopters are going to whisk me away in the stealth of the night. But

314
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,280
I certainly am not going to rule any of it out.

315
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,320
Four years of conversation that we've been to having has brought me to this point.

316
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,840
Many of you may feel the same. Some may be afraid to speak out in fear of ridicule.

317
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,480
Fear not chuckle heads. Together we're going to face the future. The light that is our destiny.

318
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,920
Welcome to the next level. Welcome to the Awakening.
