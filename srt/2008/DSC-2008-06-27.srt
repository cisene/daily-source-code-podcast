1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,060
Hey, I'm the first one to say it's a great country, but it's a strange culture.

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,940
We've got a strange culture, this has got to be the only country in the world that could

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,100
ever come up with a disease like Bolivia.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,640
Gotta be the only country in the world where some people have no food at all and other people

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,360
eat a nourishing meal and chew it up intentionally.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,160
This is the country when tobacco kills 400,000 people a year so they ban artificial

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,240
sweeteners because a rat died.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:49,740
This is a place where guns store owners are given a list of stolen credit cards, but not

9
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,080
a list of criminals and maniacs.

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Now they're thinking about banning tyguns and they're going to keep the fucking real one.

11
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:30,080
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped by us, to the next generation radio contenting my

12
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
years.

13
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:44,080
I like to think I'm flying into this journey.

14
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Come closer, I am the sky.

15
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:59,080
Come closer.

16
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,080

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Hey, little rat, here's my home tonight.

37
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,080

38
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,080

Hey everybody, how are you doin?'

50
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:04,140
How are you doing? This is the show that's been five days in the making. It has been a week

51
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,980
and you know right now it's Friday evening. It is quarter to nine and the first top opportunity

52
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:16,140
I've had has been going non-stop and you know I could even see some people getting worried

53
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,940
what's going on people calling me you are right man what's happening so first of all apologies and

54
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:30,220
really you know Twitter has become so unreliable that I don't even post updates or anything to it anymore

55
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,700
and the blog well yeah what am I going to say show coming I tried that at the beginning of the week

56
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,180
and I shouldn't do that because it was not coming it's not coming now the really wasn't much to

57
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,220
report on because there was a lot of family stuff I'd take care of on the continent in the Netherlands so

58
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:54,540
I went over oh was it Monday yeah Monday morning I flew over a beautiful flight by the way

59
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:03,580
had about 25 not tailwind oh yeah oh yeah doing 170 not so that was nice nice and fast

60
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,940
and I went up to flight level five five haven't been there in a while because of course the

61
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,100
the wind's got even stronger the higher you get and it was just oh it was beautiful and you know

62
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:21,420
me right I like to smoke a nice home home rolled tobacco at altitude there and use my

63
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,820
ass trays everything is on autopied at listening to the BBC World Service fantastic

64
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,820
anyway so I had some family stuff to do as I said it took up a couple days

65
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:40,380
and then I flew back on what was it uh oh when's day evening I think yeah and then I had meetings

66
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:47,100
in town this morning our yesterday morning and this morning and London how man the traffic it's

67
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:54,220
just gotten it's gotten so horrible I've progressively seen this traffic just go from bad to worse

68
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,260
even though the introduced the so-called congestion charge which was supposed to you know make it a

69
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,060
lot less congested well quite the opposite seems to be happening of course there's still lots of

70
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,460
construction going on in London they're renewing all of the sewer pipes the drainage

71
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,660
because they're all 100 years old that's just maintenance they should have performed 50 years ago

72
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:20,060
probably but whatever reason didn't it's just been a mess and then Nelson Nelson Mandela's in town

73
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,020
celebrating his 90th birthday so there's concerts which of course is great because if you're in town

74
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,940
oh man the city is fantastic as long as you don't have to go anywhere unless you can get there by foot

75
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,780
and so to be two hours to get home I took the train in this morning but you know you're coming

76
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,780
cross-tron across town from east from shortage where the HQ is back to the west side then out of

77
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:50,780
the city it took me two hours two freaking hours luckily I could utilize some of that time

78
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,820
on conference calls with San Francisco add to that of course I'm still doing this morning radio

79
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:01,260
show thing on aeroclassic rock but man the experiment is really gonna pay off for us today because

80
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:09,660
today I have a special for you and that is an interview I did this morning with commissioner

81
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:16,620
a European commissioner so you know you kind of have the the European Parliament where the laws are made

82
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:23,020
I guess with the ministers council so they they make the laws but these these commissioners

83
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:29,820
in the European commission they're like starfleet command okay they can they can reject stuff they

84
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,900
can't really they don't make the laws but there's only 27 of them of course for the

85
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,940
one free to the 27 member states of the United States of Europe as I'm going to start calling

86
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:47,260
it from now on one of them of course is Naley Cruz she's the the competition commissioner

87
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,460
and she's the one that find Microsoft you know two billion euros or whatever the hell the amount was

88
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,100
that something in the billion billion of something is a lot so that's the kind of power

89
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,900
and what this Vivian Redding has been working on she's trying to harmonize all of these

90
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:09,740
roaming rates now of course in the states we used to have this where you know if you went from one

91
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,460
state to the other or so often even one town to the next before these networks really rolled out

92
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,660
you'd have to pay extra roaming charges extra fees because these networks would then have to do

93
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,740
some kind of settlement amongst them and it turned out you know it really became a big scam

94
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:30,380
um and a lot of money was made on that so that of course still happens in Europe even though

95
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,340
you can have vote of phone in the UK and then you go to Germany and you get and you go by the way

96
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,260
you don't have to show your passport anymore to get from one country to the other but then you

97
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,380
arrive in Germany and all of a sudden you know if if someone calls you it's going to cost you 20

98
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:50,380
cents per minute if you call someone else it was costing up to like a full euro so you have a

99
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:59,340
buck a minute not to mention sending text messages half a euro or internet data 15 euros per megabyte

100
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,780
I mean just outrageous pricing even though it's the same company so she's been working on

101
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:13,260
fixing this and the calling price is she brought down by like 70% on roaming charges by enforcing

102
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,380
law and she said okay you guys really need to fix this shit and she's like she's no joke man

103
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:24,460
she's she's the she's the real deal um she said if you guys don't fix this by July 1st

104
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,540
and you don't bring these rates down significantly I'm going to propose law and look at what happened

105
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:36,700
last time so anyway um I specifically got a recording of the interview and it's an exclusive

106
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,380
here on the Charlie even though of course it has been broadcast in the Netherlands actually I got a

107
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,180
little bit of the air check so here's some just like a 15 minutes of the of me talking in Dutch

108
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:51,180
for those of you who care but of course the the roughest thing for me personally this week was

109
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:57,500
you know it's some other stuff that's been going on it's the passing of George Carlin which really

110
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,860
I I found out about this early in the morning and when I read the the email started coming and I was like

111
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:09,580
it really shocked me and and I have to say I I was really upset for a full day and like you know

112
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:17,420
just this guy this his awesome take on the on life and how he's able to turn that into words

113
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:25,260
uh it's just always amazed me it's been a huge inspiration just tremendous and uh I will really

114
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:31,500
really miss him I know a lot of Americans will well miss laughing about ourselves uh with him as the

115
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,940
catalyst so even though we got some cool music lined up for you today I just I have to play

116
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,580
some George Carlin so here's four minutes of George Carlin on voting I believe this is from his

117
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:50,300
his last special which was somewhere around January 2008 his last HBO special so indeed one of his

118
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:59,340
last words check it out George Carlin notice I don't complain about politicians everybody

119
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:04,300
can planes about politicians everybody says they suck yeah well where do people think these

120
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,820
politicians come from they don't fall out of the sky they don't pass through a membrane from another

121
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,780
reality they come from American parents and American families American homes, American schools,

122
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:19,340
American churches, American businesses and American universities and they're elected by American

123
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:26,540
citizens this is the best we can do folks this is what we have to offer it's what our system

124
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:35,340
produces Garbage in Garbage out if you have selfish ignorant citizens if you have selfish ignorant

125
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,420
citizens you're gonna get selfish ignorant leaders the term limits they're gonna be any good

126
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,860
you're just gonna wind up with a brand new bunch of selfish ignorant Americans so maybe maybe

127
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:51,980
maybe it's not the politicians who suck maybe something else sucks around here like the public

128
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:59,420
yeah the public sucks there's a nice campaign slogan for somebody the public sucks

129
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:06,540
fuck hole fuck hole because if it's really just the fault of these politicians then we're

130
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,820
all the other bright people of conscience we're all the bright honest intelligent Americans ready

131
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:18,140
to step in the same nation lead the way we don't have people like that this country everybody's

132
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,580
at the mall scratching his ass picking his nose taking his credit card out of his family pack

133
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:31,260
and buying a pair of sneakers with lights in them so I have solved this little political dilemma

134
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:39,820
for myself in a very simple way election day I stay home I don't vote fuck them fuck I don't vote

135
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:45,740
two reasons two reasons I don't vote first of all it's meaningless this country was bought

136
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,820
and sold and paid for a long time ago they shipped a shuffle around every four years

137
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:58,540
doesn't need a fucking thing I've certainly I don't vote because I believe if you vote you

138
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:04,620
have no right to complain people like to twist that around I know they say they say well

139
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,940
if you don't vote you have no right to complain but where's the logic in there if you vote

140
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,900
and you elect just honest incompetent people and they get into office and screw everything up

141
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,460
what you are responsible for what they have done you caused the problem you voted them in you

142
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:26,380
have no right to complain I on the other hand who did not vote who did not vote

143
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:34,940
who in fact did not even leave the house on election day and then no way responsible for

144
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,060
what these people have done it they've ever right to complain as loud as I want about the mess you

145
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,020
created that I had nothing to do with so I know that a little later on this year you're going to

146
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:48,060
have another one of those really swell presidential elections that you like so much you'll enjoy yourselves

147

148
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:58,060
as for me I'll be home on that day doing essentially the same thing as you the only difference is

149
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,380

everybody knows it's only ones and us that's the way it goes

159
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:43,340
today everyone repeats so you can just delete it's just another game just like yesterday

160
00:16:44,300 --> 00:17:01,580
turn off the sound when the hate starts going around there's always someone

161
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:11,660
loves to say they're the right ones anyway they're the comments on

162
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:28,700
just turn off everybody knows only ones and us that's the way it goes

163
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:43,340
today everyone repeats so you can just delete it's just another game just like yesterday

164
00:17:43,340 --> 00:18:05,100

165
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:16,380
about everybody knows it's only ones and us that's the way it goes

166
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:28,380
today everyone repeats so you can just delete it's just another game

167
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:37,180

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,580
beautiful you know do you know Jeff how long we know each other man like two

172
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,860
three years and now he's got the ringtone business and it just met a working musician

173
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,820
and sticking it out in the new media and being successful it makes me feel so happy and also

174
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,100
proud just proud of what Jeff has accomplished check them out of the jefsmith.com and of course

175
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,660
up at a link in the show notes at dailysourceco.com yeah I may not have the same level of energy

176
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,580
that I normally have but man I'm so full barred so incredibly tired let's change topics here

177
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:37,180
for a second this is due to a conversation topic that Charlie Delta Lima started of course

178
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:41,580
you know Charlie Delta Lima's Charles the drunkard Londoner he was talking about touching his

179
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:49,260
I think it was his his his iPod when it was plugged in just touching the metal back and getting

180
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:55,740
this electric kind of charge like feel and I said I had had exactly the same thing on Patricia's

181
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,380
Mac is that a MacBook or power book I think it's a MacBook an old version MacBook which he

182
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,220
uses downstairs in the kitchen I had the exact same sensation and boy I'll tell you I got

183
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:12,300
comments just streaming in from everywhere. Adam it's Michael calling from Chicago Eleanor in the

184
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:22,300
U.S. responding to dailysourceco 770 Drunken Charlie I forget his code words Charlie Delta

185
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:28,780
Charlie Delta Lima you got it. Talking about the strange sensation on his iphone

186
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,780
I was just in London last week I was there for two weeks visiting lady friend

187
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:41,420
I had to have a MacBook pro brought it with me and I was recording a podcast while I was there

188
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,900
not even and I got some kind of weird harm while I was recording it but the point being that

189
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:55,500
I would graze my hand over the MacBook pro over the area just above the touch pad and I soaked

190
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,380
that my blation I thought maybe it was because I didn't have a

191
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,300
I had around the power converter but I was just running it it wasn't grounded I thought maybe

192
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,820
you know maybe it's because it's not grounded Adam and you know before you go any further

193
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:15,900
that man you know this is interesting because I came back from Holland I which is also

194
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:21,100
which also uses 220 volts so they have a different plug but it's the same voltage and I believe

195
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,780
the same cycles which would be 50 cycles per second versus 60 cycles in the U.S. there is a difference

196
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:35,900
there and I plugged my MacBook pro power adapter in and I literally heard a pop and it got warm

197
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,580
because it was in my hands and so you know I immediately unplugged it but it basically blew up

198
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:49,420
and I'm wondering if there's something related to these these these power book adapters or the

199
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,620
or the power supplies and I guess not because that would have nothing to do with Charlie Delta

200
00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:02,300
Lima's iPod charger but anyway I had to do that too had to go to the Frick and Apple store to get

201
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:07,980
a new one oh yeah they England it's high voltage high voltage high voltage high voltage

202
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,260
I think it did be that was what it was

203
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,460
all right now I get the point

204
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,260
by the way so I did go to the max store and picked up a couple of things of course what I was there

205
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:27,180
also picked up an ITV which is kind of cool plugs into USB port and you get digital television

206
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:35,260
so that's pretty cool up here in the attic and what else I picked up a compact flash card reader

207
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:42,220
because I want to update the map so my my navigational equipment for the Delta Sierra

208
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,580
and what else I picked up there was something else I was going to tell you about oh

209
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:52,140
so by the way a lot of Americans work it in the in the Apple and the London Apple store

210
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,780
and so the guy who helped me you know he said he's American and I think they're there because they

211
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,380
train the staff and maybe the lot of the or management or whatever I mean the whole store is

212
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:06,460
it beautifully efficient and so I'm talking to the guy I said hey any chance that I could

213
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:12,620
sign up and pre-register for the 3G iPhone on July 11th and here's the guy's response

214
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:18,940
it's absolutely not I'm like okay yeah I figured as much you said but you know you just

215
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,180
stand in line because it could be really cool I said well what's the cool about standing in line you know

216
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:28,700
it's like you know I said you know it's it's pressed for you guys which is great I understand but

217
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,540
you know I don't want to stand in line she said well you never know who you're going to meet

218
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,100
on line it was kind of like patronizing which it it irks me a little bit you know you could meet

219
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:42,300
El McPherson she was in line last time like you know dude I'll see you on July 12 okay

220
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,140
I don't know what it was it was just a little bit it just irks me a little bit anyway back to

221
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:53,900
this this electricity problem here's another call Adam it's Chris lightning here like the

222
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,700
I was I'm calling about the problem that we're not not with you the problem more or less

223
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,980
some say some of these seem to get whenever you touch an aluminium MacBook or MacBook Pro or

224
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,980
a power book or the back of the iPhone the child is on command and there was referring to the other

225
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:14,380
day of yesterday um the reason why get that sensation is it's static electricity it's the fact

226
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:21,020
the the MacBooks the iPhone the power book is plugged into a power source and basically is then

227
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:26,060
vibrating along in your own body electricity then vibrates on that if it's like with those um

228
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,460
all those those plasma balls you know that the ones that generate do that just keep yeah I know

229
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:35,980
you you stick your hand on the on the glass and a little bit of ash there you stick your hand on the

230
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,420
glass and then the blue flame comes towards your fingers I know what you're talking about but you

231
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,980
hand on your hands stand up until an hour touches you it's all through a static so stupid

232
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,820
you're just running through the body you know we'll see what the old all through the

233
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,980
body but how come I have that only with the I mean with iPod and is it because of the metal

234
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,940
the aluminium is that what it is that's interesting so when you brush it you get a vibrating feeling

235
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:04,140
it's just there to stay moving between you um because I'm going through you down to the granule earth

236
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,140
in the artist's case just moving along you natural age you can get it with different metal objects as

237
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:16,540
well um something about their example back out how about a steely down sorry real obscure reference

238
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:25,180
for the older a chuckle head done amongst us yeah okay yeah all right Chris thanks one more of those

239
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:31,580
hello and go man here so run the being rude and just let's talk to you on my iPhone 2G

240
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:48,220
I don't know if I'm going to look at my iPhone or iPod touch you're not going to look at the

241
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:53,340
device you're going to look at the first speakers and it's on an Apple product I'm looking

242
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:59,580
to feel a buzz on them it's on a word is it's actually leakage in the power supply okay

243
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,820
here's another theory leakage in the power supply scene now we're back to the power adapters

244
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:10,540
in the mains 50 hertz 50 cycle mains on it please not and there was an Apple shop here the day

245
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:15,980
looking for MacBook when Apple MacBook started with with those arrogant fuckers there I know what you're

246
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,780
talking about like shell on it uh oh there's a MacBook Air actually and I've got the

247
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:26,460
the cell phone I felt it was actually the same feeling on it there was a Mac book flow right

248
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,860
and it's also it and that didn't have that like feeling on it and the Macbook Air and the Macbook

249
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:37,580
Pro have got these other things covering like that and like that and I've done a mini covering

250
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:43,340
yeah you know I think it's under leaky counselors the only thing that you're trying to

251
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:49,180
come to my day use they they're going to leak it you know I think it's for now it remains a

252
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:55,900
mystery is it's static electricity is it leakage and you're feeling 50 cycles hmm what is it one

253
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:03,020
things for sure it's all made in China um I'm laughing at myself here so the next call I have

254
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:09,180
lined up to really fits in with all this extremely extremely important talk about uh iPods

255
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,260
I had them this is Justin from back and it was podcast.com and you've been talking about lately

256
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:21,900
why people won't stand up for their liberties being stripped away well I figured out and it's like this

257
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:30,860
where's this okay all that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could

258
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:39,100
be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working hours or start a

259
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:49,660
ration and even when they became discontented as they sometimes did they're discontent let's know

260
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:58,700
where because being without general ideas they can only focus on petty specific grievances

261
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:05,260
after my Georgia well 1984 all right man they were correct

262
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:38,060
say about crosses some of those that work for us is what I say about crosses some of those that

263
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:44,700
work for us is draw the same that for us it oh

299
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,440
Now you do what they told you

300
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,440
Now you do what they told you

301
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,440
Now you spell it

302
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
Now you do what they told you

303
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,440
Now you do what they told you

304
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
Now you do what they told you

305
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
Now you do what they told you

306
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,440
Now you do what they told you

307
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
Now you do what they told you

308
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
Now you do what they told you

309
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,440
Now you do what they told you

310
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
Now you do what they told you

311
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
Now you do what they told you

312
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,440
Now you do what they told you

313
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,440
Now you do what they told you

314
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Now you do what they told you

315
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
Now you do what they told you

316
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
Now you do what they told you

317
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,440
Now you do what they told you

318
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Now you do what they told you

319
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,440
Now you do what they told you

320
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,440
Now you do what they told you

321
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
Now you do what they told you

322
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
Now you do what they told you

323
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,440
Now you do what they told you

324
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,440
Now you do what they told you

325
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,440
Now you do what they told you

326
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:49,440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

327
00:31:49,440 --> 00:32:19,440
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

328
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:47,400
Oh, I got turned on to that just recently.

329
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,720
I had wasn't really in the rage against the machine, but this really really does it for me.

330
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,720
Crikey.

331
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
All right.

332
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,320
Yeah, so talking about, I won't do what you told me and how they should be working for us.

333
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:08,400
Let's see how one of the most powerful political bodies in Europe is working on creating

334
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:14,040
a better Europe for its citizens, and this is the whole reason why I reached out to European

335
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,560
Commissioner, Vivian Redding, who is Commissioner on behalf of Luxembourg.

336
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,160
And she is the Commissioner of the Information Society and Media.

337
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,800
And so, of course, she understands the importance of ubiquitous internet and, you know,

338
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,600
traveling from a country to country here is like traveling from state to state in the U.S.

339
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Hence, of course, the United States of Europe.

340
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
But the roaming fees are still in place.

341
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,240
And of course, you know, the telephone providers are all saying, well, you know, we

342
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,560
have to recoup our investment.

343
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,040
Well, yeah, in fact, as she's going to use a word, I'll tell you right now, because

344
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,280
when she used the word, I actually had to look it up while I was talking to her.

345
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,120
And the word is a necronism.

346
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,400
And a necronism, I'm just bringing up the dictionary.com page right here, is something

347
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:09,120
or someone that is not in its correct historical or chronological time.

348
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:15,160
So essentially, something that is really, really old-fashioned, that's what that means.

349
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,480
So I interviewed Vivian Rating this morning, you know, this is the thing that, on one

350
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,960
hand, really pisses me off, because, you know, if I'd called up High Madam Curry, I've

351
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,760
got a show, I've got a podcast or whatever.

352
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,280
And I said, I like you to like to interview, because, of course, you don't get to talk

353
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,880
to a Madam Commissioner immediately.

354
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Oh, no.

355
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,280
No, you gotta go through a whole bunch of people.

356
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,680
Now, of course, on this radio show that I'm doing the morning, I have a producer and

357
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,920
she's damn good.

358
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:51,280
But still, the fact that it's live radio, national, that's why these politicians jump

359
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,280
on it.

360
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,280
I mean, they're calling me.

361
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,280
They're like, hey, man, I got something to talk about.

362
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:02,840
It's amazing how they're clamoring any way to get their message through to the people.

363
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,680
And I want to first main basis with a lot of these people now.

364
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,520
It's very, very interesting to me.

365
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,920
So now, of course, I'm taking all this knowledge, all the stuff that I've learned

366
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,920
together with you guys.

367
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,480
And I'm applying that, these conversations and listening and thinking about things.

368
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,240
I'm applying it to this, you know, very small country with its own language that really

369
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,120
doesn't go much beyond the borders, except somebody in South Africa may kind of understand

370
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,120
it.

371
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,280
So now it's time to start reversing that process.

372
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,240
So now finally, I have something that's in English and believe me, I'm going to be talking

373
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,000
to a lot more of these people at Starfleet, the Starfleet Command of Europe.

374
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And go ahead, look it up.

375
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'll put a link in the show notes.

376
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,240
You'll see, this is no joke.

377
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,800
I mean, these commissioners, they got a huge amount of poll and power.

378
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,000
And they're out to prove something.

379
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,440
They're out to prove that what they're doing is good for Europe and good for the individual

380
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,280
member states in Europe.

381
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:01,280
So we're going to get a little bit of an education from Madam Reading and some specific

382
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,040
information on how she's approaching the situation and how we're going to benefit as consumers.

383
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,840
Now particularly these days, what oil just jumped above 140 bucks.

384
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,600
So that's a whole nother story.

385
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:18,960
By the way, I might want to point out that Russia is turning out to be the new Saudi Arabia.

386
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,880
These guys, you know, they're building gas prom.

387
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,400
It's going to be a company that will be worth a trillion dollars.

388
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:34,600
And the Russian CEO of gas prom said, well, look for $250 a barrel oil next year.

389
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,600
So anyway, amidst all of that crap, if you can save 50 bucks a month on your cellular

390
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,600
bill, or how about, you don't actually be able to work efficiently and use your internet

391
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:53,480
connection, your mobile internet connection, or you might say, Java card into your laptop,

392
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,120
to be able to use that cost effectively, will greatly enhance productivity, will greatly

393
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,880
benefit the economy and directly impact your pocket by not costing an arm in a leg.

394
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,920
So it's like a super win win, of course, the evil guys in this equation are the phone

395
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,920
companies.

396
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,360
But we have the kind of guy like a doopily thing going on.

397
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,560
So this is kind of in their business model to be a little bit evil.

398
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,560
But that's okay.

399
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,560
It's just that their time is up.

400
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
The gig is up.

401
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
It's 2008.

402
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
Now it's time to change.

403
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:21,560
Okay.

404
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,000
So I'm going to play this with a little, it's about eight minutes.

405
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,120
So if you get totally bored, which I don't think you will, because this is them working

406
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,120
for us in its finest form.

407
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:35,640
And remember, I'm, I'm pro European, I, you know, not dig in the Lisbon Treaty at

408
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,640
all.

409
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,800
So, yeah, I'm just moving beyond that and I'm going into, okay, how does this thing work?

410
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Does it actually work?

411
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,600
Will the United States of Europe function?

412
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Will it benefit us?

413
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,560
Will it benefit member states in smaller countries?

414
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,200
Well, apparently if you've got a microphone on a national radio show, yes.

415
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,480
But of course, I'm spreading that foreign wide now and a little secret, much further

416
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:06,880
and wider than the audience of the radio show into the, into the chucklehead community.

417
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,880
Okay.

418
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,240
So a little bit of the radio show is I'm just coming out of a record and then straight

419
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,240
into the interview.

420
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,240
It's all live.

421
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,880
No, it's enjoy the show.

422
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
Here we go.

423
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,360
Oh, it didn't fire.

424
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
It went better this morning.

425
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,000
Did you do it on the hall of team London calling your heart the clash and it's close

426
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
to you in the dance?

427
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,360
Well, I'm going to give you a little bit of pressure on what I've done, leave codes and

428
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:32,040
Starfleet command, no, but proud to for more from it, Vivian Redding, says Commissioner

429
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,320
for Information Society and Media, Madam Commissioner, good morning.

430
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
Good morning.

431
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,680
I appreciate you joining us this morning on the program and of course, yeah.

432
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,440
Oh, yeah, and I want to thank you for your service to the people of Europe in particular

433
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,840
with our current economic issues with increased fuel and food pricing, your initiatives

434
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:57,880
certainly with pricing for the international calling and SMS text messaging and data is highly

435
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
appreciated.

436
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,880
Thank you very much.

437
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:06,800
But you see the European politicians are there for the better of this continent and of

438
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
its citizens.

439
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:15,280
But it's very important to take in hand the pricing where pricing is projected to the

440
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,800
negative side of sea citizens.

441
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,840
And I could not agree with you more and this is also, this is actually it's quite new for

442
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:28,240
us to see something affect the citizens of the European member states so directly and with

443
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,720
this initiative coming from Europe.

444
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,800
So it's very important to, particularly in these days, as we look at issues surrounding the

445
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,560
Lisbon Treaty and what this Brussels actually mean to all of us in smaller countries around

446
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,560
Europe.

447
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,880
If I could ask you, what type of power do you actually have Madam Commissioner as a commissioner

448
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,680
in our European system to actually force companies like the mobile operators to lower their pricing?

449
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:59,520
Well, the European Commission, you know, has power of proposing regulation and laws.

450
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,560
The law makers are the council of ministers and the European Parliament.

451
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,600
So they need to agree on every proposal I do.

452
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:17,480
That means the commission proposes the disposition on this and the decision on this is done

453
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,680
by the elected law makers.

454
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,160
Okay, but clearly there is a lot of power and I think in this case it's a good thing

455
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:30,400
if we look at your colleague and of course, Dutch citizen Commissioner Naly Krus who

456
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:37,000
has done an amazing job of finding Microsoft billions of euros.

457
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,880
Could it come to that, could we actually force or see such a huge measure of force used

458
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,840
against the mobile operators if they don't comply with the wishes of, well, with your

459
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,800
wishes and eventually laws will be put into place to regulate them?

460
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,160
That has already happened.

461
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:02,720
You see, when we tackled the voice roaming costs, which were a poor and high and we

462
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,120
made European regulations and that is applicable directly in each member state.

463
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:17,240
So the operators had to comply with this new rules and the costs for roaming on voice

464
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,800
went down by 70%.

465
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:25,040
And for which we're very appreciative and actually I think the word roaming is almost

466
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,440
an insult in these days with the European Union because we don't need to show our

467
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,600
passports with movement between countries.

468
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,200
Shouldn't we even abolish the entire concept of roaming, certainly considering many of

469
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:41,960
these operators have networks in multiple countries and are actually running over their own

470
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
networks.

471
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,280
It seems to be like it's almost well, it seems very unfair towards the consumer and

472
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,320
maybe even anti-competitive.

473
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:56,120
It isn't an optimism actually, you are absolutely right and that's why we were fighting

474
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:03,120
it because you see we see a continent where people and I can move freely and here people

475
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:10,480
are punished when they cross the border, that is not fair and that is not the European

476
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:18,080
one but we have to go step by step because we still do have our national telecom markets.

477
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:23,400
The reforms which we put in place is to eliminate the barriers between these markets

478
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:29,360
and make it possible that more and more of a pan European players come into force because

479
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:35,040
that is also a question of surviving in a globalized world.

480
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,840
You see we cannot continue to do bits and pieces in Europe.

481
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:44,800
We have to unite forces also for our operators in order to be strong enough to sustain

482
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,240
the competition from operators, from outside Europe.

483
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,520
I could not agree with you more in particular for the generation which is now growing

484
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,400
up and is now crossing the borders who are very used to low-cost internet access, which

485
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,360
I think is probably even more important than the SMS pricing for the future.

486
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:10,120
Some of the some pricing across the borders, even 15 euros per megabyte of data received

487
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,200
which is multiple times more valuable than the price of gold.

488
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,760
It's absolutely, I would call it a scam madam commissioner would you agree?

489
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,680
And it has no relation to the real cost of the operators.

490
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:28,000
You see we do not want to punish operators that would be completely out of reason.

491
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:35,800
We want to have strong operators who can get in their cost and can get in a remineration

492
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,560
for the service they make.

493
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:46,360
But if this is going 100, 150, 500 percent over and above a normal commercial relation,

494
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,600
that it is not acceptable anymore.

495
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:54,200
And that is why we have asked from the operators and put a deadline for the first

496
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:01,920
of July to bring down their cost for SMS and for data roaming, bring them down to normal.

497
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,120
I wait until the first of July and see if things happen here, if things don't happen

498
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:12,440
here and I have announced that already very clearly, I will make the same proposal I have made

499
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:18,760
for voice roaming, that means I will propose a regulation in order to bring those prices down to normal.

500
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:23,760
I cannot tell you how much I love hearing a strong woman say words like that is very exciting to

501
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,760
be.

502
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,640
I want to tell you a quick report from the member state of the Netherlands, our Secretary

503
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,680
of State of Economic Affairs, Fronka Hameskettik, has really been doing good job, he's tried

504
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,640
to communicate to the local telecom operators here, and of course you probably are aware

505
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,080
that we had the highest roaming charges of all the member states that has been reduced

506
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,720
in just the last week.

507
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:50,320
In fact, however, indeed, if I look at your statement and you were very clear and I'll just

508
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:55,760
repeat it briefly, if the situation stays unchanged until the first of July you will see

509
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,760
from today's council that I will not be the only one to believe that our regulatory

510
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,760
intervention won't be necessary once again, so I'd love the CEOs of all mobile operators

511
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,160
do your job, respond to consumer concerns and lower your prices, you know exactly where

512
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,160
you have to go.

513
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:14,800
Those are very strong words, Madam Commissioner, at this moment not a single operator in the

514
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,960
member state of the Netherlands is even at the 28-year-old sense you're speaking of that has

515
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,080
to be lower, not a single one, they made a big deal about going from 50-year-old sense

516
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:30,840
down to 33 or 29, I have a very little hope that they will comply by your July 1st

517
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,840
deadline.

518
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:38,400
Well, let's wait and see, there might be a miracle, you never know.

519
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,840
Like Holland will win the European Cup, that would be a miracle.

520
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:48,520
Well, you see, I have said the first of July and I'm going to wait until the first

521
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:54,040
of July, because I have been very much criticised by the operators, they say, we

522
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:59,080
can get the market in a equilibrium, we do not need processors to do that.

523
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:04,280
So I told them in February, okay, I trust you, you were bringing the market in a equilibrium

524
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,760
until the first of July, but if you don't do it, then unfortunately I have to come in.

525
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,800
So I give them a chance until the third of July, but that's the beginning of the next

526
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,800
week.

527
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,520
Madam Commissioner, hopefully we couldn't speak with you again after the first of July after

528
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,800
you have a major assessment, we would love to contact you again and find out with the next

529
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,800
episode.

530
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,800
Of course, we're also hopeful and we're all positive here, but we do have hardouts,

531
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,800
so that would be possible, that would be fantastic.

532
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:36,800
Thank you, and we will certainly come back to this during the course of July.

533
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,800
Fantastic.

534
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,800
Vivian Reading Commissioner for Information Society in Media.

535
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,440
Thank you very much for your time this morning and again, thank you for your service

536
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,440
to Europe.

537
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,440
Good day.

538
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,440
Good day.

539
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:53,440
I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out.

540
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,440
You're on her, please don't bang that gavel.

541
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:02,440
You can try this cowbell out, let's don't give a nod.

542
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:11,440
To the harnessed work and lawyers, jerseys and tigers, man, yeah, it's jersey time.

543
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,440
Oh, how's it going, Adam?

544
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,440
It's jersey time.

545
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,440
Give the fish on musicologist of the shot shot shot.

546
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,680
So, this week in my football Friday segment, I wanted to give the listeners a little backstage

547
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,680
pass.

548
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,040
I want to give them a little bit of behind the scenes on how this football Friday thing

549
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,040
has been going down for a long time.

550
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,760
You see, I've been giving you some choices every week, I give you some choices of bands

551
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,720
that you might like for the football Friday segment.

552
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,160
And then you choose which band you think is appropriate for the show that you're doing

553
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,800
that week.

554
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,800
Not this week.

555
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,320
Not this week at all, because this week on football Friday, I've only got one band

556
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,320
free to play.

557
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,360
The band, of course, is from New Jersey.

558
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,560
That goes without saying the pot saved music capital, New Jersey.

559
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,880
But you got to check these guys out because they are going to officially break summer

560
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,880
2008.

561
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,600
They're going to officially start it all off.

562
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,480
The band's name is Woodfish.

563
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,560
They completely, completely rocked at the opportunity to talk to them.

564
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,120
They're great guys.

565
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,720
And I think you're just going to absolutely dig this.

566
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,720
Well, choices this week, big band.

567
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,720
You're going to like this.

568
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,720
It's band diddly.

569
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,720
By the band Woodfish, check it.

570
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,720
You know it.

571
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,720
You're going to love it.

572
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,720
What's all this?

573
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,720
Stop it, think about it.

574
00:48:49,720 --> 00:49:19,720
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

575
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:41,840
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

576
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,840
But I can't make a foul

577
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,840
That's what you're doing

578
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,840
I wanna break you down

579
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,840
I wanna break you down

580
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:59,840
With the sun we know it

581
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,840
That's all the way

582
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,840
That I'll be as you can't hear

583
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,840
But what I'm all alone

584
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,840
I'm feeling good there

585
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,840
Who would say that I'm with you

586
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,840
It's all that I'm all to do

587
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,840
That I'll be as you can't hear

588
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:47,840
That I'll be as you can't hear

589
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,840
That I'll be as you can't hear

590
00:50:52,840 --> 00:51:01,840
That I'll be as you can't hear

591
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:06,840
That I'll be as you can't hear

592
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:11,840
That I'll be as you can't hear

593
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,840
That I'll be as you can't hear

594
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:22,840
That I'll be as you can't hear

595
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:28,840
That I'll be as you can't hear

596
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:35,840
That I'll be as you can't hear

597
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:40,840
That I'll be as you can't hear

598
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,840
That I'll be as you can't hear

599
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:48,840
That I'll be as you can't hear

600
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:54,840
That I'll be as you can't hear

601
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,300
I'm just music

602
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,220
Surgy shirt was he tied, once again an excellent selection

603
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,840
Particularly for this full bar Friday

604
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:56,040
Oh man, I see that once again put too many eggs in my basket, have a whole new clear energy

605
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,680
thread that I want to share with you.

606
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,680
I'll say that for Monday, because Monday will be kind of back to normal or some semblance

607
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,680
of normal.

608
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:10,540
Let me see, you know what, I always find one of these comes in, it's a good buddy or a European

609
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,540
correspondent.

610
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:22,780
Comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip,

611
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:31,840
comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, so next week France is taking over the ship of European

612
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,840
Union.

613
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:39,280
Yes, long commands under the dwarf, Thakuzzi, you know, by the way, I think Thakuzzi has

614
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,280
got it together, man.

615
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:46,040
He got his model wife just in time for the presidency, yeah, the man, he's a player.

616
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:51,940
With married six Italian model Karabun, he will be there for even more, opening his

617
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:52,940
gobb.

618
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:58,760
And in unrelated story, you have just lifted sanctions against Cuba, with this piece of

619
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,760
you a say in that story.

620
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,760
I heard that.

621
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:08,740
And by the way, do you know that any Cuban who manages to escape Cuba and put his feet,

622
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:13,440
his feet on American solid, automatically gets US citizenship?

623
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,640
No, I didn't know that.

624
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,640
Is that true?

625
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,360
No, I don't know.

626
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:22,560
All the other stuff, I'm sure you're right, because you are the official EU correspondent

627
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,560
of the Charlie.

628
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,560
Thank you very much.

629
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,720
Comic strip blogger, willow, by the way, has a response to some of the stuff, of course,

630
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,200
going on an Italy, willow, my sister, she called it it in two parts.

631
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,000
I haven't even had time to put those two parts together, so that'll have to wait until

632
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
money as well.

633
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
But she gives that.

634
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,520
It paints a pretty bleak picture of things going on in the European member state of

635
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,520
Italia.

636
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,800
Oh, I'm proud of you casting with the credit.

637
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,960
It is crazy.

638
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,440
It's just just young balls.

639
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,400
Hey Adam, hi, doing.

640
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,400
I'm tired.

641
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,400
I'm going to suck today.

642
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,400
It's just again.

643
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,400
This is in trouble.

644
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,400
Number one.

645
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,040
I'm so fried, young.

646
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:10,200
I'm not going to get any of them right today.

647
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,680
I have no idea what that was.

648
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,680
Number two.

649
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,800
I don't know.

650
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:20,640
I don't know.

651
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,760
It could be total in Africa for all I know.

652
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,720
I really don't know.

653
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,760
And this is number three.

654
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,120
Dunn.

655
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,120
Dunn.

656
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,120
Dunn.

657
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,120
Hey.

658
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,840
Yeah, this one.

659
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,840
I know.

660
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,340
Oh.

661
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,800
Why, you gotta get at least one, right?

662
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,800
Dunn.

663
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,800
Oh, I gotta stop.

664
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,800
I gotta stop.

665
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,800
I'm just gonna stop it.

666
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,800
Dunn.

667
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:42,640
I'm too tired.

668
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,480
Don't know the end and that's it. The null of this week's answers are from

669
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,480
Answer number one

670
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,120
Christopher Cross

671
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,120
Sailing oh

672
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:29,440
This is answer number one and this is answer number two. It's the need to

673
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,660
It's really enough

674
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,400
Um

675
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,440
The answer number two, the niche William sits your conscience.

676
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,440
Oh, the hell with this one.

677
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,440
And this is answer number three.

678
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,440
High gloss.

679
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,440
You have gone down.

680
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,440
You have fooled.

681
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,440
The best one.

682
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,440
Get to come.

683
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,440
You don't know.

684
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,440
You better go.

685
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,440
One more chance.

686
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,440
You better go.

687
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,440
You better go.

688
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,440
You better go.

689
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,440
You better go.

690
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,440
You better go.

691
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,440
You better go.

692
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,440
You better go.

693
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,440
And you fool me.

694
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,440
Question number three.

695
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,440
All right.

696
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,440
Glossing.

697
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,440
You'll never know.

698
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,440
Yeah.

699
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,440
This somewhat slower hit us than usual.

700
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,440
Number one hundred and twenty eight.

701
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,440
So Adam, how did you do this week?

702
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,440
Well, I suck monkey balls.

703
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,440
Yon, thank you for asking.

704
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,440
But I enjoyed singing along because I recognized all of them after the first time.

705
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,440
Around two out of three.

706
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,440
No.

707
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,440
So four out of six points.

708
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,440
No.

709
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,440
The first one.

710
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,440
One hundred hit us.

711
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,440
So that's it.

712
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,440
Yeah.

713
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,440
The answer to this hit us.

714
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,440
And also the links to iTunes.

715
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,440
So you can buy the tricks.

716
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,440
Featured in the hit us.

717
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,440
Online up to be found to hit us on video.com.

718
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,440
Adam, thanks for playing again.

719
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,440
Everyone else.

720
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,440
Thank you for listening.

721
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,440
Next week, I'll be back for another hit us.

722
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,440
So until then, have fun.

723
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,440
Take care.

724
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,440
And remember.

725
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,440
Think with your arch.

726
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,440
Bye-bye.

727
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,440
Hit us.

728
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,440
That's chie-mail.com.

729
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,440
In ho-yan-polet.com.

730
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,440
Jayden, P.O.L.T.T.

731
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,440
Go!

732
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,440
All right, Yon.

733
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,440
Thank you so much, my friend.

734
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,440
And I think that definitely was a signal that I need to wind down this through our Friday

735
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,440
to start the Charlie episode number seven hundred and seventy two because I...

736
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,440
Is a fried little boy.

737
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,440
Let's chill out.

738
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,440
Listen to some...

739
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,440
Come on, Edda.

740
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:59,440
Edda Lass.

741
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:07,440
My love has come along.

742
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:16,440
My lonely days are over.

743
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:23,440
Your life is like a phone.

744
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:32,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, at last.

745
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:40,440
The skies above the blue.

746
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:49,440
My heart was wrapped up in clover.

747
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:58,440
The night I looked at you.

748
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:07,440
And I found a dream that I could speak to.

749
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:14,440
I found a dream that I can't go home.

750
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:24,440
I found a thrill to rest my cheek too.

751
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:34,440
Oh, yeah, you smile.

752
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,440
You smile.

753
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:46,440
Oh, and then the spell was guest.

754
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:50,440
And here we are.

755
01:00:50,440 --> 01:01:02,440
Oh, you smile.

756
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,440
Edda Lass.

757
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,440
That song always gets me in the right mood for the weekend.

758
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,440
I hope it puts you in the right one as well.

759
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:13,440
And if you live in Australia, I hope it wrapped up your Sunday night just fine.

760
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,440
Edda James at last.

761
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,440
It's on then a source code episode 7772, the end of a footballer Friday.

762
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,440
They have a great but rather tiring and busy week.

763
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,440
I look forward to talking to all of you again on Monday.

764
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,440
And of course Sunday for no agenda.

765
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,440
Hey, live your life with passion and want to last.

766
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,440
Enjoy your freedom.

767
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,440
Another fine, medium presentation.

768
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,440
Stick it in your ear.
