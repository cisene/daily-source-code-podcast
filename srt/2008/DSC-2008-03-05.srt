1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now the man willing to ask the questions that lead to the answers that spark more questions.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's Adam Curry and the Daily Source Code 731.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We don't have to debate for me.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Going to go to the cinema and TV.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Down in the bass, we got to be family.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Going to plug it into another thing saying,

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Can't say not so we know it won't be true.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hold him, we'll have him ready to go.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I want a kill top radio.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want a kill top radio.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I want a kill top radio.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm going to do it again, I'm going

14
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,900
to do it again, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to build a video, a video going on, smart

15
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,300
time with 15 million dollars and then that will go into its library panels, so I'm going to do

16
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,300
it again.

17
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,800
Now, I'm just going to do it again.

18
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Motherfucker, the下次 window is cleaned up here.

19
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,400
Now, there's a cover track that will be карlichted up.

20
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,240
There's so much flex and thanks for watching it, I'm going to turn the pedal in front of

21
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,400
the back of the car, it may be already wider and I'm just going to finish it yourself,

22
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,000
then it will protect the balanced pound compressor from the electric vehicle.

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,080
All day here in the United Kingdom, more and more home I'm just getting everything set

24
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
up here.

25
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,920
I've gotten rid of most of that annoying sound that I had on Monday, it turns out it

26
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,760
is indeed a ground loop and I haven't quite found it yet, but I'm pretty much in the

27
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,520
process of getting rid of every other piece of hard board, hard board, hard board,

28
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,440
outboard gear that I've been using for the show.

29
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,440
I just don't need anymore.

30
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,400
It's all pretty much contained in the Mac, gotten my MIDI controller for the faders

31
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,920
from my tactile feedback.

32
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,480
And of course, on the way my father-in-law is building my new mic preamp, so getting

33
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,360
everything together very excited about that.

34
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,360
It is the 5th of March, 2008, which reminds me that I have to say happy birthday to

35
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,560
Willow, my sister who was born, what is she today, I'm not supposed to give out

36
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
ages, huh?

37
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
She's younger than I am.

38
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,680
That's the good news for her.

39
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,920
She's celebrating an Italy today, had a nice quick catch-up call, a little chat with her.

40
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,360
I got to tell you, I stayed home today, the thinking was that I actually, I was supposed

41
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,400
to have a lunch in the city, which I canceled, and let me tell you why yesterday, of course,

42
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
I didn't do a show yesterday.

43
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,800
I was up very, very early for me, getting up 6.37 o'clock, that's early.

44
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,000
I actually saw my daughter walk out the door off to school, so just to give you some kind

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,040
of idea, I had to do the trash, Patricia hadn't taken the trash out for the two weeks

46
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,360
I was gone, so I knew I had a little extra work to do, and the trash guys come to us

47
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,120
for pretty much first on the route, so you got to get you shit out early, and you know,

48
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,600
there have been going back, they only collect once a week where we are, and I hear there's

49
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,960
talk of them not only scaling that back to once every two weeks, but also charging you

50
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,480
extra for more than like, you know, three and a half bags or something, the, anyway,

51
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,560
that's the UK's trash problem, don't have to deal with that right now.

52
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,320
So then I went to the dentist, I was able to get slaughtered in early at an 8 a.m. appointment,

53
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,720
I got a couple things, you know, and my head's fallen apart, what can I tell you, and

54
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,160
it comes with age, I guess, back home, had a quick bite to eat, gathered on my things,

55
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,800
and then rushed off to the station to take the train to Waterloo Station where I usually

56
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,600
pick up a cab, and then from the cab, I'll go off to the office. Now, I'm in the, I'm in

57
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,680
the train, and by the way, usually when I get to the station to Guildford Station, which is

58
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,880
just like a five minute cab ride from the house, I'll buy myself a nice cup of Chino, you know,

59
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,560
I'll have, I've got day, HDS, PDA, FM, and LMA, no PABC thing that gives me, you know, high

60
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,880
speed, like a megabit per second broadband access on the train in my laptop, so I've got that

61
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,920
in my bag, got my mac and my bag, but usually I'll choose to just listen to a couple of podcasts

62
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,920
on my way in, because I'm a commuter, and that's what you do is you chill out, and you sit back,

63
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:24,240
you listen to some shows, and I was thoroughly enjoying this week's no agenda, yo agenda, I should

64
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:33,440
say, yo agenda is is a program that discusses no agenda that I do with the John C. to Vorac,

65
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,040
so the candy man and comic strip blogger do the show about our show, which is kind of a throwback

66
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,160
to the old answer records of the 50s, and even more recently, of course, we've had some of those,

67
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,880
and it was entertaining, I was laughing my ass off, and then, you know, they were talking

68
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,480
and talking and they were kind of droning on, and it was, it was nice and warm, I didn't have

69
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,040
my cup of Chino because the train, you know, there was an earlier train that just arrived,

70
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,480
as I walked on to the, onto the platform, and so, you know, kind of their words were

71
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,240
mashing into, you know, the announcements, the train was making, I fall asleep, which is okay,

72
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,000
because I know the Waterloo station is the end of the line, and when I'm there, I'll have to get

73
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,400
up and get out, you know, not a big deal, so I won't miss any stops. I was a woken,

74
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,880
the some time later, I'm not quite sure how long I was asleep, it couldn't have been more than

75
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,200
15, 20 minutes, and there's a crowd of like four people standing around me, and I can feel that

76
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,680
my neck is like cockback, you know, I really have passed out essentially, and then people like

77
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,640
say, so are you all right, night, okay, they thought I was dead, I was in so much of a coma

78
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:53,120
that they actually feared for my, for my well-being, oh man, so, um, there you go,

79
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,320
and I was groggy. There were people, there were new people coming onto the train to go

80
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:06,720
back down south, like, oh, right, this is a signal from God, and I could feel it, you know,

81
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,680
how you kind, you know, they talk about narcolepsy, or even if you go into our courses, I guess,

82
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,080
if you've been given anesthesia, you can feel it, you can feel it in your head, you know, this is kind

83
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,320
of, it's almost like a chemical, and you know that is trying to put your body down and put

84
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,280
you to sleep, and it's just exceeded clearly in, in the situation I was in at the time,

85
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,760
and I was like, this is not good, and I grabbed a cup of chino at the station, got in a cab,

86
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,480
and I was groggy for the rest of the day, and I was like, okay, I know I got some late night calls

87
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,120
to do, so I'm gonna sleep in a little bit, and I think that was a pretty good idea, so I'm feeling

88
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,800
much, much better, and much, much more awake, and with you guys, so there you go, life on the road,

89
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,000
I guess. I've been talking about this, it's kind of a minor discovery, and I didn't know it until

90
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,680
I dropped my iPhone in the toilet several months ago, but there is indeed an indicator inside the

91
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:08,000
iPhone and the iPod Touch that will turn fully or partially pink, which allows the, if you

92
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,800
take it back under warranty, and you know, you just want to say it doesn't work anymore, for instance,

93
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,120
my phone, everything works as far as I can tell, except the touchscreen is broken, so now I'd love

94
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,360
to take it back and say, hey man, the touchscreen broke, but you gotta, you know, I don't know what happened,

95
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,840
but of course I know, fully well what happened, and indeed, on the inside, I guess you could say,

96
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,760
maybe there's a little bit of pinkishness, it's kind of hard to see, so I'm not sure if they use a

97
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,560
microscope or some other optical device to actually look and see if you've, if you've played by the rules,

98
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,160
well, of course, someone came up with a great idea on how to hack around that little minor

99
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:49,840
nuisance. Hey Adam, okay, so you drop yourself on at the toilet, my solution to that,

100
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,840
maybe it'll work, maybe it won't, it dropped a wide out, and just put it over the little indicator,

101
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:02,880
and voila, literally, I don't know, it might be worth giving it a try, thank you very much, I'm

102
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,160
remarkable, and I won't be able to carry. No, I love you too, man, thank you very much.

103
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,240
Hey, that's a good idea. I just mind try it, just see if I can get away with it, although I need

104
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:21,120
to know how they look into that little hole to see if it indeed, if the indicator has turned color,

105
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,000
I just mind try it, it's not that I really, I think that I'm sure there's going to be another

106
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,680
version of the iPhone coming, and I may be interested in that, but for now, everything satisfied

107
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:41,680
with my Nokia 80010, which, of course, you can buy at a 15% discount and cheaper nowhere else online,

108
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:50,800
go to patchowoffers.com, enter my code, daily source code, and you'll be with the way and soon on your

109
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,760
way to having fun with the internet tablet, full web 2.0 browser. That's really what does it,

110
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,480
from the end Skype, which, of course, is our instant messaging system of choice for pod show.

111
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,920
Primary still taking place in the U.S., following it here in the U.K., I got to tell you,

112
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,160
man, they showed Ohio last night on, I think, was a channel for news here, and it was just,

113
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:23,840
they make it look like the whole state of Ohio is a fucking slum. Boy, what a slanted report those

114
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:32,320
guys were bringing. This place is in demise, job losses. I'm sure it's not great, but it's not

115
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,320
like all of Ohio, I mean, it was really, really, really slanted. A little bit annoying, I'd have to say.

116
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,240
Of course, their primary is taking place in other states as well. Some of them, not quite as large

117
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,960
as Ohio, in fact, here's a call from the smallest state in the Union, where my mother was born,

118
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,200
Rhode Island. Hey, I'm a shrine in Rhode Island. I haven't called in a long time, a bunch of bullshit

119
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,520
going on in my end and all that jazz, but I get back into the DSC. This is one of the common great

120
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,120
because, like I said, I live in Rhode Island, and today's primary day. And I know what I haven't

121
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,160
voted yet in my life. I'm 28, never voted in my life. And you know what, I always said, it was

122
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:17,920
Kennedy inspired me. I would vote. So, you know what, I found a candidate to this part. And I said,

123
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,720
in my voter registration card, and I went through all the steps like a good little dovy and

124
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,920
good, all my shit done. And guess why? Here comes because my registration card was postmarked

125
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:39,840
three weeks and two days and not exactly one month from the primary day, I can't vote.

126
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,280
I don't know if this is a law everywhere, but you know what, it was nowhere on the registration

127
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,720
card, and it was nowhere on the time of the website, and it wasn't anywhere. So, for the first time,

128
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,720
I'm like, I want to vote and the state does talk to you, you can't vote. I've been living in the

129
00:12:52,720 --> 00:13:00,560
goddamn state for 28 years. It's not like, they don't know me here. What the hell? You know,

130
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,000
so I'm just kind of missed, you know, I mean, I finally got the gumption up to do it, and the man's

131
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,960
telling me now. So, you know, here we go with all system thing again, and man, I just don't know if

132
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:22,160
I want to vote again. No, that's just, just pisses me off. It's just pisses me off. I won't,

133
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,120
hey, hope you have a great day. Let's see, going back for a long ways, 28 canal technicians,

134
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,760
folder, not a scratcher. I love you. No, I'm almost great here. I hope you win all that jazz.

135
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,320
See you later.

136
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,080
All right, man. Thank you. And I apologize. The system clearly is screwed up.

137
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,360
I presume you were going to vote Republican. I think the Republicans have all those really harsh

138
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,840
measures that make it very complicated. Yes, sucks.

139
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:54,800
And the more I, I think actually this primary has been fantastic. It's been a learning experience

140
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,680
from myself personally. I've been, of course, very involved with the Ron Paul campaign who,

141
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,600
although no longer listed still is in the running. You know, they only show McCain and how

142
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,400
could be these days on the Republican side. And I am not a card carrying Republican member,

143
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,440
which makes it a little more complicated being an expat and not registered as a Republican

144
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,960
for the primaries. But, of course, for the presidential elections, should Dr. Ron get on the

145
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:28,480
ticket somehow. I'm going to vote regardless. And I'm not going to vote from McCain. I can tell you

146
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,600
that. But I'm not too sure about about Obama and Clinton. You know, it's to me is there's some

147
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,840
pros and cons on both sides. I listen very closely to Obama and it sounds like a lot of promise

148
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,080
for change. He's very charismatic. I like that a lot. I think it's a lot to be said for a

149
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,360
charismatic leader that people are almost in love with. That's fantastic. But, of course,

150
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,240
there's also a lot to be said for someone who knows how works in Washington. And they're both

151
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,840
pretty much, excuse me, fueled by Wall Street. So I'm not too high in either of them. I think

152
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,360
I'll agree with my friend, John C. Devorac on this. That Obama would make a great

153
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:15,120
president for the next election in 2012. What in every 100 Americans now in jail? This has been

154
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:23,040
going around going around the blogosphere, unbelievable. How many of those are in jail for marijuana?

155
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,000
I'd like to know. That's a lot of people. That's like three, three and a half million people in jail.

156
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,600
And when they come out of jail, you know, what kind of chances do they have? A lot of them

157
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:41,680
are going to come out in the next year or so. Like 700,750,000, so they pay their dues. They spent their

158
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,720
time. What's the program when they come back out? I mean, this is, of course, we've got these

159
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,320
commercial jails in America. We've been through this on the Charlie before. And of course, they get paid

160
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,960
extra for each inmate they have. So there's a lot of really weird incentives going on. And it's

161
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:05,200
quite concerning to me. You probably also heard that all the athletes who are attending the

162
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:12,400
2008 Olympics will be allowed to keep personal journals, i.e. a weblog. But those may not include

163
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:20,160
any other types of media, no pictures and no podcasts, no audio, no video, no pictures. And this

164
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,880
just kind of summons for me that these Olympic gains are one big political money making

165
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,120
crap scheme. And it's unfortunate because of course, I don't think they were intended that way in

166
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:40,240
the early days and Greece. But I have had a couple meetings in the past 20, 30 years with

167
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,040
members of the IOC, the International Olympic Committee, and it's all about the money. It's all

168
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,160
about the sponsorships. It really doesn't feel when you're talking to those guys and man, they're

169
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:57,040
arrogant. It doesn't feel at all like it's about sport anymore. And now they're not, you know,

170
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,640
and the reason why they're not allowed to distribute any type of digital media is because

171
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:14,800
well, they've already sold all those licenses to mainstream comic strip comic strip comic strip

172
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:22,080
comic strip comic strip. Our favorite EU correspondent ends up on to the Charlie comic strip

173
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:28,240
blogger checks it. Yeah, Adam and they get pictures carry. So the best actresses,

174
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,360
Bruce the best for in film in Oscar's 2008, came from European Union countries who were

175
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,720
it was from Spain, France, England, Ireland and Austria. It's funny, you know, we have these conversations

176
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,800
about shows and formats and programs. And we're doing a lot of shows here in the UK. And initially,

177
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,560
you know, I was getting some pushback from programming on the US side. It's like, well, you know,

178
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,160
another guy with a British accent. I'm saying, excuse me, would you please go look at the Oscars?

179
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,200
Would you please look at the number one, two, and three television shows in the United States?

180
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,960
I mean, the American Idol Simon Cowl dancing with the stars. You've got Len and the other guy

181
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,400
English accents. I mean, it appears to be kind of what's working. And maybe it's, I don't think it

182
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:19,600
has anything to do with the quality of the acting. It's maybe just a shift. It's, well, no, it is a

183
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:26,320
shift. It seems that that's what consumers of entertainment, like right now, I guess.

184
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,600
So, you is not that yet, huh? Anyways, I wanted to say that in UK, liberal, Democrats, party,

185
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,280
calls for a friend, I'm about UK membership in EU, which, of course, would result in UK living

186
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,120
EU. And so, Adam, better get yourself dual, American British citizenship, or you may be

187
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,000
expect from UK, but clearly because you are now calling people to demonstrate in UK,

188
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,600
but it's also could be considered a kind of reason to experience from UK. Ladies and gentlemen,

189
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:09,520
and Oscar goes to Adam Kerry. Yeah. I don't think I'll be expelled, CSB. In fact, tomorrow

190
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:17,120
I have my interview with the council for my national insurance card. Now that I've moved my

191
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,200
employment over to the UK, I'm being a really good citizen, paying all the taxes, I can, except for

192
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,120
capital gains here in the UK. I have the right to live here because I'm married to an EU national.

193
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,360
So, I'm contributing, I'm working, and I still believe there is a, there is a freedom of speech

194
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:43,120
here in the UK, CSB. So, I think that even though I'm suggesting, and in fact, I am recommending

195
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,400
a protest, and this is all about the flash mob, and still to this date, no one stepped forward,

196
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,880
no one has said they're going to organize it. I'm still calling out to my UK listeners. I think

197
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,840
it's time we do something, don't get caught, you know, tidying away or hiding in a bottle. Let's

198
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:10,800
do something about this. But the dual nationality show me where that's easy. It is not easy by any,

199
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,400
means whatsoever. The United States does not like people having dual nationality. And right now

200
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,400
with the UK and the tax laws, I don't think I have a shot at all, and it won't change that much.

201
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,240
And by the way, they can kick anyone out of the country they want, where the other passport that

202
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,200
belongs that country or not. No, man, no, I'm doing everything right, and I'm speaking my mind,

203
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,760
which I'm pretty sure is still allowed in this country. I'm high shelves, I'm here in London.

204
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,920
Hey, Charles, I'm talking to you. I'm going to go in 19, beautiful day, Blue Sky.

205
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,440
I just caught one of your episodes. I tend to listen to the latest one of the work backwards when I've

206
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,240
made the film. Okay. So, I've just heard some op-soul. Elky Brooks pulled this is op-soul stands for

207
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,880
organization for the preservation to the soundtrack of our lives. It is a nonprofit organization

208
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,000
that encourages people to remember songs based upon the soundtrack to their lives

209
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,320
and relate those to where they were when they heard the song or the first time or whatever comes to mind.

210
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,480
And it really does work. And we've been doing a lot of that. In fact, this time for another

211
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,000
op-soul episode, which I'll put together this week. It's op-soul, Oscar Papas here, Oscar Lima.

212
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,640
.podshow.com. So, yeah, Elky Brooks, I played that one on a recent Saturday show.

213
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:34,640
The singer. Oh, man. And you said, do you remember where you were when you heard that?

214
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,520
And I tell you what, my older sister, Pippa. So, my older sister.

215
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,920
Doesn't get more British than that, having an older sister named Pippa. Yes, what about Pippa?

216
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,280
Uh, you used to sing it. And that's why I first heard it. I'd never heard it first.

217
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,080
I hadn't actually heard the song. I don't even heard her singing it for years. And then you just

218
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,880
played that. It's really very neat thinking about my lovely beautiful sister, who has just had a

219
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:10,320
beautiful 9 pound baby boy, has 3rd time around. Good baby. Have you babies? And uh, so my point is,

220
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,120
I'm now going to go and buy that song. Stick it on a speedy and send it to her.

221
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,360
Because she's a real special person. And you just made me smile. I'm saying that song.

222
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,280
You have enriched my life. And you have also encouraged a sale.

223
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,360
Okay, sure. I'm going to buy it. Wait. But, yeah. That's not the point. I'm going to buy it.

224
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,680
Oh, I take it by. All right, Charles, thank you. Well, this is the point. And if only the

225
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,080
record companies would understand this. That people, I mean, there's a lot of music being made.

226
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,800
And allowing people to share it, to promote it, invokes this. There you go. Not just a great

227
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,640
memory, a great experience shared amongst the friends, but it induced a sale as well.

228
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,880
All right. Let me share one from the soundtrack to my life since you were talking about your

229
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:05,040
sister, Pippa, who just had a Pippa, who just had a child. When Patricia and I on August 27, 1990,

230
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,120
went into the hospital, St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey.

231
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,080
Our daughter was to be born that day. It was a very laid-back situation.

232
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,520
New Christina was breached, so it was a cesarean section. So it was a little more planning,

233
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,120
a little more organized than most people might have the opportunity for.

234
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,760
We were in the operating room. I knew all the doctors. It was a very comfortable surrounding.

235
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,520
Patricia was feeling great. I was feeling great. And they had the radio on at the time. And it was

236
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,760
light FM 105.5 WLTW in New York. And just as Christina was being lifted from my wife's

237
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,640
abdomen, as she was brought into the world, this song was played.

238
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:17,920
Don't forever not far better. Some have gone and some remain. All these places have

239
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:28,320
a moment. Full of us and friends. As you can recall, some are dead and some are living.

240
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:45,760
I love them all. But of all these friends and lovers, there is no one

241
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:56,640
compares with you. And these memories lose their meaning. When I think of love as something

242
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:06,000
you, don't I know I'll never lose affection. But people and friends, when people

243
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:15,440
I know I love something about them. In my life, I love you more.

244
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:43,760
I know I'll never lose affection. But people and friends, when people

245
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:52,880
I know I'll often stop the thing about them. In my life, I love you more.

246
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,280
In my life, I love you more.

247
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,440
Presented by the organization for the preservation of the soundtrack of our lives, the Beatles in my

248
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:14,880
life. Boy, does that bring back memories? Daily source code episode number 731 helping people

249
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,840
nationwide, getting them jobs. Hello, Adam. This is Torsten Collin from Germany.

250
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:29,440
I'm listening to your show for about three years now and about two years ago. I got involved

251
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:36,720
with making podcasts and created some podcasts because I'm a assistant professor at the University

252
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:45,200
of Mines. And so I created some episodes related to my lessons that I'm a teaching in class

253
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:53,600
for my students to download them and get their hands on this educational stuff wherever they want.

254
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:04,720
So I realized that E-learning podcasts are in general, are a little boring and got very noisy,

255
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:14,560
audio quality and all this stuff like ask questions which you can't really hear on the

256
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:23,120
recording because the students ask questions. Don't have microphones and so on. So my approach

257
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:31,520
to this E-learning podcast was pre-recording all that and getting online with all these entertainment

258
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:38,000
aspects because I think the entertainment factor is totally missing in A-learning right now.

259
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:48,080
So I created my website called jocophory.com, the free space for geography and my students love that

260
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:57,680
so much that right now. The folks at the University decided to give me a job or at least half a

261
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:05,600
job 20 hours a week from this month on to create go on creating episodes for the better and

262
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,320
master degree in geography at the University in Mines. Isn't that great and you know why in the

263
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:20,320
first place I started recording podcasts. It was because of you because of the daily source code

264
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,440
and all this coolness and this cool stuff happened in there and this entertainment and lifestyle and

265
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:36,640
I found that so entertaining that I wanted to put it into this E-learning podcasts. So I did that

266
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:46,400
and you are the reason I did it and so I felt like sending this voice message to you to say thank you

267
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:58,640
so much for inspiring me and all the other listeners of the DC. So I'm 32, my assistant professor

268
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:06,560
at the University, still got all my hair on a strong way to the middle class right now with the first

269
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:15,040
thousand bucks in my pocket. I love you. I really mean it straight. Great hair and I hope you win.

270
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:22,640
Do. Oh dude, Torsten, thank you very much. You humble me with that man. Absolutely. And anyone who's

271
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,760
out there teaching kids anything is a hero in my book, a big ass major F and hero. We should get back

272
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:35,840
to that. In the States, it's still like that. Teachers are still revered as some form of hero,

273
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,880
though I think it's diminishing as well. And it's a little bothersome. I'm getting old.

274
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:48,320
I'm sounding just like my parents used to sound. Oh, cranky. Oh man, awesome.

275
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,720
Let me see what else do we have. Oh yes, still lots of conversation going on about the

276
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:01,680
Airbus A320 that landed in Hamburg, Germany. I posted the video which was from lively.com on

277
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,280
it's still up on the homepage if you want to go take a look at it. And what's really interesting is

278
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:16,560
the comments thread Kent and. Oh boy, Robin, of course, Robin from the InsightWorks. Both Boeing

279
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:22,560
pilots, both checked in, both have confirmed a lot of what I said. And it's some real good insight

280
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:28,400
is into how you perform across wind landing with a huge machinery like that. Of course, it is

281
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,640
actually exactly the same as a smaller aircraft, although there are differences in limits,

282
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,280
et cetera. But a really good read. And I think you should take a look at it. And there's another

283
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:43,360
other call about this. Hello Adam, Marcus from Germany. Um, just your comment today in

284
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:49,520
the I think episode 730 about the Airbus that well had this somewhat strange landing in Hamburg,

285
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,840
Germany. Um, it was actually a little bit more, well, a little bit stranger or world than you

286
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,280
reported because the left wing actually hit the runway. I have seen furrows from from Airbus,

287
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:07,200
well, I have close ups off the damaged winglet. So it was a little bit more almost a crash than

288
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:14,240
then you made it sound. Also, to the another in Germany, the accident into the investigation guys

289
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,240
are investigating because the question is why the pilot took the runway where he had this

290
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:28,080
high amount of crosswind. So anyway, just wanted to let you know. Well, thanks. Bye.

291
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,520
Yeah, indeed. I saw the pictures too. And if those are authentic, then the winglet did indeed

292
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,280
touch the ground. Still, the whole situation was right for a go around and I think it comes

293
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,000
down to decisions. And when the report comes out, I think you'll see that the pilot's probably

294
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,920
should not have even attempted that landing. So, you know, to say, boy, they're heroes, they saved

295
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,920
everyone's life. I don't think everyone was in that much danger. I think that just when it

296
00:31:53,920 --> 00:32:01,680
comes down to good airmanship, they probably should have found an alternate airport with a runway

297
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:09,840
more situated for the wind situation. And we'll see. But again, you know, scraping a winglet is

298
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,640
not the end of the world. And the go around was performed perfectly. So, check that to thread out.

299
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,760
I put a link today at the top of curry.com to the comments as you can read along. And if you

300
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,120
are an airman or pilot, feel free to join in on the conversation. Hi, Adam, it's Brennan Jones,

301
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,440
Brennan Jones.com. Hey, Brennan. To the latest, they say, well, the nylon on the latest,

302
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,800
they say this morning. And he said on deposit protection with British banks and depositors,

303
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:42,000
and he protected for the first 2,000. Okay, this is from Monday's show where the nylon came

304
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,960
back to life and into our lives. Thank goodness, the New Yorker in London. And he explained with some

305
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,440
degree of authority that in the United States, the FDIC ensures your deposits at a bank up to $100,000.

306
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,800
But according to the nylon, in the UK, and of course, we just had a bailout of a big bank northern

307
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:09,040
rock for 50 billion pounds. That's a hundred billion dollars. Apparently, the insurance here in the

308
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,960
UK is, well, according to nylon, it was only up to the first 2,000 pounds of what's on deposit,

309
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,000
which, of course, makes a big difference for the, for my perception of the bailout. First of all,

310
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,720
although I would say regardless of the amount, if there's a cap on the amount, then that cap is

311
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,720
there for a reason. You should be ensuring up to that amount. And if it's above that amount,

312
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,480
well, tough cookies. But no, they bailed it out, bailed everyone out. And I understand their reasoning

313
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,120
behind it, still not agreeing with the amounts that have been put up as guarantees. But let

314
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:48,880
listen to what Brennan says about these insurance amounts in the UK. I'm quoting from FFSAA.gov.uk,

315
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,840
which is a financial services authority. And the quote is, with the UK bank, the first £35,000

316
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:03,120
worth of deposit is covered. It's not £100,000 or sorry, $100,000 is in the US, but it certainly

317
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,920
has a lot more than £200, just not laid out. Thanks, man. Oh, that's a big difference. So nylon,

318
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,560
if you're listening, I know you are. When you're done with the performance reviews,

319
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,360
let's hear back from you. Thank you very much, but I'd call in any time, man, when you've got

320
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,080
more info, you're very close to savonstatus, my friend. That was a good catch.

321
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,800
And now for something that hasn't happened at a long time, some sexy talk from NGB.

322
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:37,920
A crap. Let's try that again. Some sexy talk from NGB.

323
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:45,200
Hey Adam, it's NGB. How the hell are you? I decided to get caught up on daily source code today,

324
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:51,600
and I checked out your link to the demographic survey, and I was totally stoked to see the number

325
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:58,720
of your listeners listed the chill cat. It's indeed awesome. You know, I still get emails from

326
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:05,280
various men who said that they discovered me through the daily source code, and they still remember

327
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,000
the old days when you and I used to flirt. Oh, they missed those. But I had to feel like I'm

328
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,480
knowing things to tell you, um, well, one, I've got a gigantic collab of cats going on on the chill

329
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:25,920
cast this week, uh, 16 different podcasters pitched in with songs and audio in support of one of my

330
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,920
listeners who actually attends Northern Illinois University. And, uh, came out great, 90 minutes.

331
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,920
You should check it out. And, uh, the remix contest for Love Spiral Song, this truth is ongoing.

332
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,760
I've been getting some great tracks, including one that's already upon the Pots of Music Network

333
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,240
by the groove blaster, and, uh, I hope that you will like it. I'm going to play it for you,

334
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,280
and I hope you'll play it for the listeners. You bet your baby. So don't be a stranger. Love you,

335
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:00,960
mean it, and I don't have to say no home now. That's right. I do miss those days, Angie. Next time

336
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,120
don't mix the song in with your feedback, and I'll talk sexy back to you, baby.

337
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:43,680
Only thing, I wonder is what I hear. We didn't begin our lives, but still not. From the foot time we met.

338
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:55,680
Yeah, well, I have it all my wishes, it's precious. That's nothing but a side of it, no.

339
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:03,680
You'll never take away from that song, but it's nothing, so you can say no to.

340
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:17,360
Say go away, this truth. You belong to me, as I feel, I'll tell you.

341
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,280
Yeah, yeah!

342
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:45,440
The spirit will be a decade. With rubbing general hands of hell.

343
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,440
You tell any trouble, and I'll be free

344
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,440
Trust in me, yeah, but we're wrong, doesn't it?

345
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,440
We have never been there in the street

346
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,440
I don't think we're ever away

347
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,440
You, that doesn't seem to be my neighbor

348
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,440
I think love can't fulfill

349
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,440
She will never take away

350
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,440
From back to all that's nothing she can say

351
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:30,440
I'll do, they go away, this truth

352
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:39,440
That you belong to me, that still belongs to you

353
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:55,440
Yeah, you belong to me, that still belongs to you

354
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:05,440
Oh yeah

355
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,440
And you mean love spirals, wrapping up the Charlie 73-1

356
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,440
I, on today I'd like to send a special shout out to all the developers

357
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,440
The software engineers who created Ableton Live

358
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,440
The hardware and software engineers who created the FaderFox MIDIController

To the people who worked on the open-source program JackPilot

361
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,440
Which started over in the Linux world to the folks who make MIDIPipe

362
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,440
And of course to the engineers at Apple who've done such an awesome job of a core audio

363
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,440
The aggregate devices you guys rock my world

364
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Wait until I put all this crap together and show you how I've

365
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Strap everything you're going to love it

366
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,440
You're going to be amazed what's possible with all the technology you guys are putting out

367
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,440
And thank you to you for listening once again

368
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,440
I'm pretty sure I'll do another show tomorrow and on Friday

369
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,440
Looking forward to a football Friday

370
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,440
I still have a jersey Todd lined up

371
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,440
So he has the day off but I have one from last week

372
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,440
I'd love to hear your tracks send them in
