00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Sierra Charlie, 7-5-8

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is the daily source code

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The daily source code

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
For $16 billion worth of airplane strap to my ass

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
For the next generation radio content in my ears

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We don't need not deep increase in

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I like to think I'm flying into this journey

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm guessing it's a crazy, good

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
To see you again, name of the way you don't record

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now it's me

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Why haven't seen you since gone

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now it's when it looks like time still rings

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You can't blame

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I guess why I'm flying in the fields

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And then it's another monkey morning comes

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Why me up again

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Once again

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I've to think you know what this is

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I feel it's gone

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now it's time to take this moment

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But let's call you

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
On the way near

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When I'm feeling

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Feeling like I want you right

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
When I'm feeling

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Feeling like I want you right

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Feeling like I want you

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Overworked and done

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Dumped across my fingers

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
On the hole in the wall

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It seems to me like you got it

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But hey, I'm stuck in my head over the wall

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But yes, why I'm flying in the fields

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And then it's another monkey morning comes

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why me up again

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Once again

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I've to think you know what this is

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I feel it's gone

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Now it's time to take this moment

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But let's call you

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
On the way near

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When I'm feeling

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Feeling like I want you right

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
When I'm feeling

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Feeling like I want you right

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Feeling like I want you

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
When I'm feeling like I want you

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Going round and saying

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Dumped across my fingers

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But I'm going this thing

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That I'm beliving

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's got a hold on me

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, I can't see

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:04:17,000
it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, I feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feeling it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,600
more about those guys. Hey, y'all. Hey, everybody. I do in Delhi source code episode number

57
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,440
7508 coming to you from the curry manner. We're located on the west side of Gtown here

58
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,280
in the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Gilford. Boy, you know, I'm feeling really good today.

59
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,840
It's not a spectacular day. Not as good as it's been the past couple days this week, but still

60
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,760
temperatures are nice, a little bit of wind, a little bit overcast, but hopefully it'll hold

61
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,880
up a little bit for tomorrow because I'm planning on flying. Basically flying Patricia's suitcase

62
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:55,320
to the Netherlands. She has another live show on Friday evening, and I refuse to go through

63
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,720
that whole rigour roll when I have a perfectly fine aircraft sitting at not 15 minutes away from

64
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,200
here going through the whole easy jet thing. Of course, part of that is actually traveling with

65
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:11,080
the luggage that's what makes it really tedious. I'm going to accompany her once again and I'll

66
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,520
take the luggage over and then Friday night she has that live show. So it may actually mean that

67
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,920
the food bar festivities might not take place. This is only going to last a couple more weeks,

68
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,520
but you know, I got to support the lady P and her show Biz and Devours. And of course,

69
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:35,160
last night we had our coming out party of BT Pod Show in the UK where it's still known as

70
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,320
as BT Pod Show, not mevio. Of course, it's a different perception of pod casting here amongst

71
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:48,200
the advertising industry and also amongst the audience. Man, we had shortage house, which is this,

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,920
there's no one flying over a kind of low. Shortage house, which is this really cool private club

73
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,760
on the east side of London, where you probably wouldn't be roaming alone at night, unless you're

74
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,880
actually invited into the club. And it was awesome. We had 200 people probably throughout the

75
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:15,080
course of the evening. Journalists from media and advertising and consumer. We had all of our

76
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,720
most, I saw a lot of our BT Pod Show talent and producers walking around, sea liberties,

77
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,680
de-lebrides, super agent Keith. It was awesome. It was really, really, really cool. A lot of people

78
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,160
said to me last night, you know, I know all about these types of things, you know, you go to a minute,

79
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:40,440
it's okay, but this is a proper party. So I was quite pleased with that. Of course, had to get a

80
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,440
pretty early this morning. I'm still working on seeing how well the format of the source code

81
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,120
translates to terrestrial radio. It's very interesting. People are getting into a couple of things,

82
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,880
like the voicemail, that's pretty novel. But also instead of Twitter, you know, in the Netherlands,

83
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,160
I don't think Twitter has the same type of footprint that it has in the U.S. certainly.

84
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,920
And what people do use text messaging. And so on this show that we do in the morning,

85
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,560
people can send a text message to a short code for two, four, two. And it's kind of like a

86
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,080
poor man's yet very expensive Twitter. I think it actually costs more money for them to do that.

87
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,800
Anyway, amongst all of this, my friends, I've really let my prostate cancer prevention quotient

88
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,280
quota slip a little bit. And this is, of course, somewhat concerning.

89
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:37,080
Hey, Adam, it's been on desert. You know, when you're reducing your risk of prostate cancer,

90
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,520
cancer, you're not just rubbing one out, you're trying to rub out cancer. Thanks a lot. Bye.

91
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,320
There you go. That's a slogan, rub out cancer. Come together.

92
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:54,040
This is a public service announcement. Good friends of the Charlie Madden. We must come together

93
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:00,040
in the place for prostate prevention, fill your five quarters every week. Pay for five

94
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:10,040
quadrups, even. Okay, dude. Oh, speaking of doing that show, you know, I query why the

95
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:18,920
using the, basically, 120 kilobits of bandwidth in total, 64k going out, 64k coming in,

96
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,600
which is basically what this ISDN connection does to the studio in the hay.

97
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,040
You know, and the latency is almost nothing. It's like 60 milliseconds. And you know, I thought,

98
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:34,680
first I thought it was the codec, because they're using an AAC, things the LDJs stereo codec.

99
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,480
And I thought that was the reason. But a lot of people, including, oh, wow, PWB sent me something,

100
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,000
Philippe sent me something. Everyone, basically, came up with the same. Well, it's,

101
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,240
let's see, Bob died actually. He didn't give me an answer. He said, oh, by the way, I love

102
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,600
the new sound. Also interested in your comments and ISDN wondering if your codec is Glenn Sound. No,

103
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,360
it's just the, it's the actual codec machine is a tail loss, which is kind of the tried and

104
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,400
proven system. Anyway, he's been listening since the curry castle days. But here's the,

105
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:17,160
here's the answer read this one from Philip. The reason for this is simple, because ISDN reserves

106
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,680
these 64 kilobit all the way from you to the receiver. Like this, you are sure that at any given

107
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,560
time, you will have 64 kilobit available on the internet, which is a packet based best effort routing.

108
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,360
You'll not have reserved constant bit rate pipe of 64 kilobits or faster, but probably some

109
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,320
hundreds of kilobit best effort routing. This means that you can burst until some hundreds

110
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,800
kilobits a second, but no guarantee on constant availability. So essentially, it's a different,

111
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,560
although we call it a codec, and of course it is being encoded and decoded, the actual connection

112
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,880
of ISDN is a guaranteed in total 128 kilobit circuit. And that's why even though I have much

113
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,920
more bandwidth than not available up and down, there is some buffering involved. And when I think

114
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,480
about really what's taking place that I have to say, the guys as Skype did do a pretty bang-up job

115
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,800
on that thing. It really does work well when you consider what has to happen. By the way, it

116
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,240
kept on ringing just while I was producing this show. And it auto answers. And I could see that

117
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,320
there was some signal coming through. The lights were going on. So I opened up the microphone,

118
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,440
which was still hooked up to it. It was BT calling me. For the third time I might add British

119
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,440
telecom, saying, would you like a free advertisement of this number in the ISDN yellow pages? I'm

120
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,840
like, no. But it was kind of weird because she came to the speakers, you know, she was thought

121
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,000
she was probably calling a digital office line. So she came through the speakers in the headphone,

122
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,200
and I was talking back on the microphone like this is indeed quite trippy. I wonder if I can make

123
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,840
a regular phone call to a regular line. Probably not. I guess it's only ISDN lines. I can call

124
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,880
unless I reconfigure it somehow. I'm sure that's probably possible.

125
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:04,440
If I do have time to do the Fubar festivities on Friday, it will be thanks to the brand new

126
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,040
microphone preamp that my father-in-law made. Remember, he's 82 years old and he's soldered together

127
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,720
a preamp that I've tested it only briefly. It is kick ass. It's miniature. It's portable. It

128
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,400
works in a nine-volt battery. Has perfect connector setups. Everything is just in the right

129
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,680
place. It's in, oh, man. And I hooked it up. And, you know, I got to do a lot of adjustment. Also,

130
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,480
he did some cool stuff with the adjustment knobs. They're sunken. So the ones, you know, you've kind

131
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,560
of set it all up and you throw it in your bag or whatever it has also. He made a little nice little

132
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:43,160
carrying case for it. So I would have a beautiful guy. The knobs won't move. So once I've set it up

133
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,560
for my sound the way I like it, I'll stay that way. And I'm very excited to test that on the road and see

134
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:57,640
how it does. Let me see. Oh, yeah. This was kind of interesting. You know that a lot of people

135
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,600
asked me, I guess I forgot to mention Christina Flunker driving test. Unfortunately, on the parallel

136
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,320
park, she had a couple of other minor things and the parallel park was in a weird spot. She's

137
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,720
really good at because I've practiced this with her a lot and she's good at doing parallel parking.

138
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,880
So she was disappointed, but she wasn't quite shattered. And, you know, I said, look,

139
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,960
you know, when you pass the test, then you'll be ready to drive and until you pass it, you're not.

140
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,800
But so, of course, now I have a Renault Twingo sitting out collecting dust in the driveway.

141
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:33,640
Hey, Adam, just listening to one of the ESC's and your mentioning your girl's new car, Renault Twingo.

142
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,120
I'm happy to report that actually all the Twingo that Renault makes are made in Slovenia where I

143
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,920
come from. Good luck with Renault Twingo. Cheers, fine.

144
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,160
Dude, well, thank you so much. I have to say the Renault Twingo is a fantastic automobile.

145
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,720
I'm very impressed with it. It's, you know, it kind of drives like you're sitting on a nice,

146
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,600
comfortable lawn chair. You know, and it's a zippy for its 1.2 liter. Of course, it's, you know,

147
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,520
five, five on the floor. And it's got, you know, the iPod connectors and all that groovy stuff.

148
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,960
It's good, man. Well, you guys in Slovenia doing some good work. Appreciate it.

149
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,040
What other cars do you guys make out there, I wonder?

150
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,400
Oh, okay. Let me see. When else came in. There's a lot of, actually, some stuff about Britain that

151
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:23,960
I want to, I want to discuss. Now, I think maybe it was Monday or was, yeah, Monday,

152
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:32,920
I played a call from James. James was not angry, but James was resorting to Charles and,

153
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,960
well, Charles is Charles, or Drunken Londoner. He actually phoned in two comments. One,

154
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,440
when he wasn't drunk, which he actually made a lot of sense. And I'm going to save that one

155
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,760
for a different day. But he called back probably a couple hours later, completely hammered.

156
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,320
And you know how much I love Charles when he's drunk. Hey, Adam, Highlander, Donald.

157
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,120
Oh, wait a minute. I'm sorry. We're going to get the Charles in a second.

158
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,360
First, let me do the Highlander down under because he's going to talk about Charles and about James.

159
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,640
Hey, Adam, Highlander down under here, calling in to sympathise with Charles, the Drunken

160
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,880
Londoner, over the scandalous decision to bail out your key banks with government bonds.

161
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,240
Charles did a totally failure frustration. And to James, who also called in,

162
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,520
it's not as simple as just voting these fucking leeches out. That would imply that the general

163
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,240
population have some idea of one. Outrage is actually is, and to want to act on it.

164
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:31,880
So this is, of course, relating to the recent mayoral election, Boris Johnson, the wacky one,

165
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:39,000
is now mayor of London. And Charles was not happy with that. I think if I got it right, yeah,

166
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,080
Charles was not happy with that. And of course, there's a lot of stuff going on over here,

167
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:49,960
like the bailout of the banks in the UK to the tune of $100 billion. Clearly, they don't know anything

168
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:56,120
is to what's going on. Charles's last comment was, what the hell can we do about this? And I believe

169
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,920
it only a way to get some movement for change is to educate the wider population as to what

170
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,680
all this finance-lingual means and make them understand the implications of a £50 billion bailout

171
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,080
and that they should be after these bastards in government for, well, for basically for

172
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:17,000
treason against the state and its people. Adam, you're broadcasting in podcasting, godfather. Do

173
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,920
know anybody in mainstream TV preferably independent like the BBC who would be interested in producing

174
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:30,200
a modern day, topical, informative and appealing documentary on how finance and money works

175
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,840
and an idiot proof fashion for the masses? You know, that's a great question. And actually,

176
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,520
I received some, a couple of people sent me a link to something called The Money Pool, which I've

177
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,520
not looked at yet. I think it's like 45 minutes or an hour. So that may be really good.

178
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,680
But I know exactly the person to do this. Maureen Goldthorpe, who is a documentary and she does

179
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:58,520
a lot of popular documentaries about popular musicians, sometimes celebrities. It's just

180
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,560
interesting people in general. She goes, travel's all over the world. And I met her

181
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,240
around Christmas time, I think, a super agent Keith introduced me to where she's a fantastic lady.

182
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,880
And I think she would be absolutely perfect. And I will definitely tell her that this is a great

183
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,440
idea. And so what she's independent, what she does is she presels the idea to either

184
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,480
to ITV or BBC or whoever is interested. And she goes out and she makes it. And she has such

185
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,400
reputation and standing that I think she can pretty much do anything she wants. I think it's a great

186
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:31,320
idea, fantastic idea. Of course, I got to think about a cool and snappy name to give the whole project

187
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,680
some muscle to it. So maybe you can help me out with that. If you don't, then I have the

188
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,720
left field idea. No, okay. Well, you got another idea. I love it. Go ahead. Sure if it would work,

189
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,360
but wanted to run it by you and the chocolate heads anyway. So my suggestion is to utilize the

190
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:53,320
listeners of DSC in some sort of distributed computing model to produce an end, it is guide to

191
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,080
modern money. If each of them or listener contributed say two or three minutes worth of content

192
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:05,160
on one aspect of finance, from essentially agreed framework, could be assembled into a money

193
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:12,040
podgymentry to be disseminated over the internet to the masses. Do you think that would make an

194
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:18,440
interesting social political experiment? If it were to be successful, I'm sure the eyes of everyone

195
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,320
in the independent media would be open to spending more time educating the wider population

196
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:28,680
into the collusion that happens between government and central banks to suppress our rights

197
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,760
and freedoms by controlling everything to do with money. So before normal, hope you win Monday,

198
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:40,600
yeah, Matt, Matt this week's question, educate, to protect and enjoy your freedoms,

199
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,000
mind, peace out, from each day and under. Keep on rubbing it out for cancer, my friend.

200
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,320
Yeah, that does sound like a very interesting social experiment,

201
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,520
but I think the need is pretty dire to get this running quickly, so people do indeed understand it.

202
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,680
And maybe a media or BT podshow can help finance some of it. Yeah, there's the will work

203
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,520
something out on that end. I'm also thinking Peter Day of the BBC would be a good guy to do

204
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:12,360
something like this. He actually does shows that he calls it podcast, you know, so this is

205
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:21,320
and I've been on his show in business, which also airs on, I believe, Radio 4, Radio 5

206
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,160
on the BBC. I like the idea, man, I'm definitely going to follow that up. Now, following this up,

207
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,840
let's hear from Charles completely hammered. He is our Charles, the drunken Londoner.

208
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,160
Hello Adam, is your John Londoner, Charles? I have actually been thinking it's time.

209
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh, yeah, lovely. I am now home and I think my dirty chicken and I have finished my

210
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:56,520
beers at our melt at home and I want it to stay there. Oh, man. Everyone that you meet on the

211
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:03,400
tube that is drunk and disorderly, fuck them, fuck them. So this is a referring to Boris Johnson,

212
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,440
our new mayor and London who has said as per June 1st, it will be forbidden to have an open

213
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:14,360
container of alcohol with you in public transport. They're wankers. Anyone that you meet on the

214
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:22,520
tube that's all on public transport, they're drunk and happy, go inland. That's the way should be.

215
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,720
English people generally, they're happy and silly and fall about and just have a good time.

216
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,360
Unfortunately, there is a small bunch of people that they're aggressive and generally you can put

217
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,560
that down to just people with bad manners. But that's not what I want to talk about. What I want to

218
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:43,480
talk about is some of here I'm now sleeping with my windows open, some are happy like what to

219
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:51,240
drink. And I wondered, does anyone out there know about ball shaving?

220
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:59,480
That makes it every minute. Ball shaving, you say? I'm at this lovely local yarn, Aix supporter,

221
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,000
expert bullhood have been turned into a nice guy. He used to use one of those products that

222
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,880
dissolves hair on public hair. It's almost the metro sexual moment if you weren't so hammered

223
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,920
their Charles. You're referring to Vite, I believe, which we have discussed on this show several

224
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:26,520
hundred episodes ago. You can use one of these products, it dissolves all the hair. He said

225
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,320
anything below the way Scott has, even did his link, which I thought was a bit weird, but he tells

226
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:39,000
me that most German and Dutch men, with all of the whole fucking, sorry, swearing again,

227
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,600
I had come earlier, and I'm sorry about that, I don't know, on that last comment, the one before

228
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:50,040
the one that I just left earlier, anyway I'm rambling to come, so I'm just like, look, does

229
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:56,280
do any European or any Americans shape all of their balls and the whole cracking fact thing?

230
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,920
I'm a trainer, personally, I'm a trainer, I'll put my hands up, I trade, I like him to be neat,

231
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,480
I don't get rid of the whole lot. What do you love this anyway? I'll rambling on you, never say it.

232
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:12,120
Yo, I will do. Hi, Will. Well, okay, that's good for a survey amongst the chuckleheads. We

233
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,960
can certainly do something with that. I might even add it to the official survey, which of course

234
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:22,120
is linked every single episode from dating sourceco.com in the show notes. So are you a

235
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:32,200
shaver, a milter, a trimmer, or are you a wild one? Those are your four choices. I might

236
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,520
as we'll tell you right now, I'm a milter. Adam, what's going on? This is back in Vegas. Just listen to

237
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:48,920
the second episode of 55, the Bluewater Friday, and you play America, fuck yeah, I'm a team of

238
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,560
America. It's one of the give you a little slight correction there. Of course, that is

239
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:01,400
Traitor's thinking. However, that is the band DVBA, and you don't know what DVBA is,

240
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,560
the foreign term, and I mean, double vaginal double anal. If you see in the movie, or Gazmo,

241
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,800
they talked about quite frequently in one scene. And that's why I just wanted to give you a

242
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,720
little correction on that. So I'd like to know, all right, take it easy, love you, no homo,

243
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,760
and all that good stuff. Oh yeah, and my questions, please once a day, every day. So just like

244
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,800
another experiment, take care.

245
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,680
Hi Adam, it's Matt from Games Weasel on this week's show. We've got a big review of GTA 4. I also have

246
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,400
a little go with Iron Man as well on the 360. There's a great new tech demo of the alone in the

247
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,640
dark game, the brand new one, and you can win copies of Speed Race, it'll fall the week. That's all

I'm gonna get tips out, tips out, I'm gonna get tips out, tips out.

We want to be more free to do what we want to do.

289
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,600
We want to be more free to do what we want to do.

290
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,600
We want to be more free to do what we want to do.

291
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,600
We want to be more free to do what we want to do.

292
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,600
You want to be more serious and more free to do what we want to do.

293
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,600
We want to be more children.

294
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,600
We want to be less Sydney because I am now in isolation.

295
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:01,600
I have some time to do my part of these things.

296
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,600
I have one.

297
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,600
What is the fundamental role in working around environmental wealth?

298
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,280
give them a silver platter or do tell you know we can all just make the claim that this

299
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,420
new killer stuff that he's talking about all that stuff that stuff the rusty

00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:29,360
are playing with it's your noble that's a new killer stuff and a good stuff now

301
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,520
that's the new clear that's the nice stuff we want people to talk to a lot of

302
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:40,640
people pronounce it right maybe maybe we'll be able to rebrand that and if you go

303
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,920
with the right pronunciation I have a suggestion here if you break down the

304
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,400
word into two parts of the first syllable new new is good people like new

305
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:55,880
so we can go with the whole new thing know what that whole new thing and

306
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:03,160
the second syllable well if you just felt like is pronounced it's the word

307
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,840
clear it's clear and clear is good we like clear I really like clear this

308
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,560
clear is clear carbon there you go it's new and it's clear of carbon that's new

309
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:21,480
clear there you go my god and you are a genius I love this new clear new

310
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:29,960
clear powered by new clear new clear this bus powered by clean new clear

311
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,160

312
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:42,160

313
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:51,120

320
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,960
you're on to something my friend for sure okay one more thing here for the

321
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,840
past couple episodes have been talking about this but acuclote.com before I say

322
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,360
that the portions of the show of course are brought to you by e-music and if you

323
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:51,960
go to e-music.com slash daily source code you'll get 35 MP3's of your choosing

324
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,120
for free with absolutely no obligation so that's well worth the ticket and the

325
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,440
price of admission and acuclote was an advertiser I think they're thinking

326
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:08,120
about coming back and it's Sean actually the marketing director over

327
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,960
acuclote are called in and we've been talking about the effectiveness of this

328
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,280
as essentially the same type of advertising as e-music or the Nokia internet

329
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:22,200
tablet or other things you may have heard on the other mevio and beaty pod show

330
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,360
programming and this is one of the most distinct well put together thoughts I've

331
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,680
heard in a long time and it's about two minutes but I think it's well worth

332
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,440
it because oh hell it's about the future of a part of the the medium that we're

333
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,960
working on here check it out hey Adam Jeffs asked from Florida checking in caught up

334
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,080
a bunch of Charlie's over the weekend and wanted to chime in on your questioning

335
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,880
why the life insurance ads didn't perform as well expected on the daily source

336
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,640
code I think a lot of it has to do with context I think when it comes to what

337
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:01,720
I'll call personality media and I think that podcasting and media casting certainly

338
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,600
falls into that category and I mean the personality media is where the audience

339
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,960
has a strong connection with the host or host of the show and relies on their

340
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,520
personality and relies on that connection I think that advertising and that

341
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:20,080
situation works best when the ads are things that stick within the context of

342
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,520
the show and the context of the listeners perception of that host or host is

343
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,480
so that the recommendations carry a great deal of weight and that's why the

344
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,180
advertising when it's in that context works very well so I think that in the

345
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:40,740
case of a listener to the Charlie ads for media, music, technology all make good

346
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:45,580
sense so when you're promoting a no get any 10 or you know the music accounts

347
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,740
or things that are really fit within the context of the Charlie your

348
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:54,020
recommendation is is a really powerful on the other hand I think life insurance

349
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,900
is somewhat of a non-secretor for the Charlie it's not something that's

350
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,860
typically discussed on the show and it's kind of how let's feel then as a result

351
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,300
I think we instinctively kind of bundle that into the category of regular

352
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,780
advertising or you know media type advertising and therefore it doesn't have the

353
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:16,780
same impact and it doesn't have the same response that you would expect as

354
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,820
something that really fits nicely within the context of the show and fits

355
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,940
nicely within our perception of the host as someone who is highly qualified

356
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:30,140
strong and credible recommendation for something not that you would be

357
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:34,420
credible for life insurance it's just a little bit too far out of context with

358
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:39,460
the show in my humble opinion anyway there's my two cents and I didn't click on

359
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,260
the insurance debt but I have purchased many other items that you've

360
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:46,060
recommended on on the Charlie including a no get at any hundred first time

361
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:52,060
around anyway long time listener love your hair love your no home home

362
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:56,900
yeah yeah yeah I hope you win hopefully all win of everyone's win appreciate my

363
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,260
freedom I could go on forever but you'll cut this off anyway take care

364
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:06,700
I don't I never cut that stuff off man I will cut that off you don't mind okay

365
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,660
man thank you so much for sending that in and I was listening to it again

366
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,860
and thinking yeah you're right but you know it's extremely relevant a lot of

367
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,340
the people who listen to the Charlie are my age should be thinking about this

368
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,620
younger folk should be thinking about this as well and now I actually feel that

369
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:26,820
I haven't done a very good job at thinking about you know how to present this

370
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,580
and maybe the offer isn't isn't good you know just saying 70% off if you go

371
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:39,340
to acycote.com slash dsc I presume it still works actually or call 1-800-4-107-214

372
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:43,260
I think maybe need to talk more about how life insurance works what the

373
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,860
premiums are what the deal is we're kind of payout someone will get how do

374
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:53,060
you choose your beneficiary I mean it is kind of important stuff you know I've

375
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:58,300
hired people to give me this type of advice but anyway I enjoy the conversation

376
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,260
I want to continue that particularly and I'll do that more at the end of the

377
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,620
show probably as a reason since it's about something that may not be just

378
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:12,260
everybody now this my friends is a special treat and I want you to call me up
