00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The revolution will not be televised.

852
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The revolution will not be televised.

853
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The revolution will not be televised.

854
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The revolution will not be televised.

855
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The revolution will not be televised.

856
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The revolution will not be televised.

857
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The revolution will not be televised.

858
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
They're taking their money out.

859
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So it is a full blown run on the bank.

860
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Just not the retail version or the version you'd expect to be televised.

861
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Because as you heard, again at the top of the show, the revolution will not be televised.

862
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Nor will the downfall of the American Empire, which is surely where we're headed.

863
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Congress must not be allowed to pass this bill.

864
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The only thing I the only way to solve this is we might as well just take the hit now.

865
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I mean, I've been in business for half my half my life.

866
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And through ups and downs and sometimes you just got to take the pain.

867
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Sometimes there's just no fix and there's no fix.

868
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
There's no plan.

869
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Just given one guy a former insider, CEO of Goldman Sachs,

870
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
giving him the right to spend our money, which have already been doing.

871
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And I don't even know if Congress approved this 85 billion bailout or another.

872
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I mean, they've already put $4,500 billion into the market with.

873
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
As far as I know, not even asking Congress.

874
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So you know what's going to happen is they're going to clean up all these companies.

875
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
They will reset, but everyone's going to get bailed out.

876
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And that means, and typically I have no problem with CEOs making a lot of money.

877
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Because whatever, I don't give a shit.

878
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But if it's my money, yes, then I give a shit all of a sudden.

879
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I grossly give a shit.

880
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And it's not going to happen.

881
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So you must write your congressman or congresswoman.

882
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You must tell when this bill cannot pass.

883
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And you must threaten them.

884
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Literally threaten them.

885
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That you will hold them accountable.

886
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
When it all comes tumbling down, if they vote for any type of bailout bill like this.

887
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If any type of bailout bill period, we have to let it blow up.

888
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It has to blow up.

889
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And here's the question I have.

890
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
This is the one piece of, I guess you've called, rhetoric, which no one has really expanded upon.

891
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The whole reason for this.

892
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This is really the big lie that everyone is overlooking.

893
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The whole reason for this bailout is because the authorities, and I've heard President Bush say it.

894
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I've heard Hank Paulson say it.

895
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I've heard Ben Bernanke say it.

896
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm hearing everyone on CNBC say it.

897
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The alternative.

898
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Well, we don't want that.

899
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I would like to know my options at this point.

900
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If you don't mind, Congress, President, Secretary of the Treasury,

901
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Pop it of the Fed.

902
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I would like to know what the options are before we make any decisions.

903
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So please tell me.

904
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And ask if you're at a rally for Obama or for McCain.

905
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Either one of these jibronies.

906
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Ask him.

907
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Hey, you know, so we have to build these guys out.

908
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What's the alternative?

909
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What is the alternative?

910
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What really does that mean?

911
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
How come no one has told us what the actual alternative is?

912
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Does it mean that all these guys who've been stealing money and setting up this huge house of cards,

913
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
this Ponzi scheme?

914
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Does it mean that they get their asses handed to them?

915
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Is that the horrible thing?

916
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Does it mean that we go broke as a country?

917
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Does your plan have an alternative result?

918
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
We deserve to know what the actual alternative is to the bailout package?

919
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And it just will not suffice because everyone's going along with it.

920
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Everyone's going like, like, like, sheep.

921
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah.

922
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Oh, yeah.

923
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
No, we don't want the alternative.

924
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Why not?

925
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What is the alternative?

926
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
That everything goes bust and we have to reboot and start over again.

927
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And God forbid, we actually have to put our hands out of our sleeves there.

928
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And we're all the sleeves up and do some work to get something going and to rebuild.

929
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And maybe even while we're at it, replace the financial system.

930
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And perhaps replace a lot of the way the governmental system works.

931
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't think they want the alternative.

932
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That's the problem.

933
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's not the, I think it's probably the best alternative for us.

934
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
We've got to take the pain.

935
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
We've got to write it down.

936
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
We've got to cop to our mistakes and we've got to learn from it.

937
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So when they say to you, and I'm talking about they being the Bush administration,

938
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
the president himself, I'm talking about Bernanke.

939
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm talking about Paulson.

940
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm talking about Obama.

941
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm talking about McCain.

942
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
When they say to you, oh, you don't want the alternative.

943
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Actually, I think they say we don't want the alternative, which is right.

944
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You don't want the alternative because the huge lie will be exposed.

945
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
That you have let the American public and to a certain extent the world,

946
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
because this is not just the American credit crisis, Britain.

947
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Don't be fooled.

948
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Europe, continental Europe.

949
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You're in bed.

950
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Just as deep as we are, the European Central Bank has been pumping hundreds of

951
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
billions of euros into the economy as well.

952
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The same Ponzi scheme, the same banks, the same shit.

953
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's all coming down.

954
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The only thing this bailout package will do, perhaps, is delay it, so that all

955
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
these big fat rich motherfuckers can get out to their homes in Paraguay and

956
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
hide while the inevitable happens anyway.

957
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
We have to go through the pain.

958
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Don't take my word for it.

959
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Listen to the distinguished gentleman from Texas.

960
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
This is on Glenn Beck.

961
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The United States.

962
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
He had controversial views cause a lot of people to dismiss him as out of touch.

963
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm actually just going to pause this for one second.

964
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
This is a two-parter that I want to play for you of Dr. Ron Paul,

965
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Congressman Paul, on Glenn Beck, on the 18th of September.

966
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's good that it's two sections because the first part is about what has

967
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
led up and where we've come to at this point.

968
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And I'll probably jump in right after that.

969
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Then the second part takes us through what we really should be doing with this bailout package.

970
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And I think you'll see that the good doctor and I agree on, I think just about everything.

971
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So let's listen to this bit of Ron Paul on Glenn Beck.

972
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
On, by the way, is usually not a fan of Ron Paul.

973
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
On the Franger worse, and some things he is on the Franger.

974
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It is, unfortunately, our loss that people, you didn't have to vote for, but you should

975
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
listen to him.

976
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I don't agree with Ron Paul on everything, not by a long shot.

977
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But one thing I do agree with him on is the economy.

978
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And when you look back at this man's economic positions.

979
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And you see the red flags that he was talking about, I mean, years ago,

980
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
you've got to give credit where credit is due.

981
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Now, let me give some credit to Glenn.

982
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Glenn Beck as well.

983
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This guy, you know, I'm like it.

984
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I am.

985
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
He's switching on.

986
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And he's remembering.

987
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Because if I had a, if I had a little bar of gold for every single time, someone sent

988
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:15,000
me a YouTube video, Ron Paul talking about this exact same scenario since 2003.

989
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Well, you get the point.

990
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Now, what I'm wondering is, have the billions we've spent on the bailouts of Freddie and

991
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Fannie and AIG, is that even constitutional, the Maverick himself, the actual Maverick

992
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Now, remember, you're listening to a congressman of the United States.

993
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Okay.

994
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
This guy has been around for over 10 years in congress.

995
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
He's been a part of all the meetings.

996
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
He's been preaching over and over again about the monstrosities taking place.

997
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And here he is confirmed in everything he has said.

998
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So for those of you called him a cook, called a supporters of cook and nut cases

999
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and wackos.

1000
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I think it's time for you to listen up.

1001
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And by the way, we don't condemn you.

1002
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I don't condemn you.

1003
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's never too late to join on board, wake up and see what's really taking place.

1004
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Congressman Ron Paul.

1005
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Congressman, held me out on, held me out on this.

1006
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
The, is this constitutional, I mean, I was sitting here watching the bailouts happen.

1007
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The president's not there.

1008
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's just the Treasury Secretary and the Fed.

1009
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And then a bunch of people are like they're going into a pawn shop.

1010
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
How much you give me for this?

1011
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I think your suspicions are correct.

1012
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's absolutely not constitutional.

1013
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But the monetary system is unconstitutional.

1014
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And these problems have been building for decades.

1015
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So what Treasury did and what the Fed did is unconstitutional.

1016
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
The constitution rules for Congress to regulate the money and its value.

1017
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And they're totally neglectful.

1018
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
They didn't do anything about this.

1019
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
They're just sitting on the sidelines sitting on their hands.

1020
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But Woodrow Wilson helped create of putting the Fed in here.

1021
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
That makes it constitutional.

1022
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But if I read the constitution, isn't Congress in charge of the first strings.

1023
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Only Congress can spend my money, right?

1024
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You should definitely, if you have a chance, do some homework.

1025
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
If you've only been listening to this show for the past couple months, go back a year or so.

1026
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And you'll listen to when I had my own awakening and understanding of the Federal Reserve.

1027
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Never forget the line, the Federal Reserve.

1028
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And I use this with people all the time to say, well, the Fed's supposed to manage everything.

1029
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The Federal Reserve is as governmental as federal express.

1030
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'll never forget that line.

1031
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And it is absolutely true.

1032
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's made up of commercial banks.

1033
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And we have given them, given them the right to control our money.

1034
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And I woke up to this over a year ago.

1035
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And well, here we are.

1036
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Now we're seeing what that awesome power actually entails.

1037
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And how illegal it really is.

1038
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And they're getting around this way.

1039
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
They spent $85 billion yesterday.

1040
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And they say, well, it wasn't appropriated.

1041
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
We just created the money.

1042
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But they're stealing value from your dollar by increasing the supply of money.

1043
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
They defy your currency.

1044
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You paid a tax by higher prices.

1045
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Please understand this.

1046
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And I just can't help but interrupt.

1047
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I've really gotten clued into this.

1048
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And I just want to make sure everyone understands.

1049
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
They printed that money, okay?

1050
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It wasn't money that was in a budget that they took out of somewhere else and put it

1051
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
towards saving AIG.

1052
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
They printed it.

1053
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Well, they didn't really print it.

1054
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
They just put it into an entry on a spreadsheet.

1055
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
That's how they create money.

1056
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And they have the authority kind of by the Federal Reserve Act to do that.

1057
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And when there's more money in circulation, then your prices go up.

1058
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That's basic economics.

1059
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I shouldn't have to teach you that.

1060
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And the whole process of appropriation and the Congress being responsible.

1061
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Totally neglectful.

1062
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I've right now this week I got to thinking Congress ought to just go home.

1063
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I think they're relevant if they don't take one themselves.

1064
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
The role that they're supposed to perform.

1065
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Do you think we're headed towards 1929, 1979, or a 1989 style Soviet collapse?

1066
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It could be the 89 Soviet collapse that won't be the same.

1067
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
But the system will have to be revamped.

1068
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And how long do you think before?

1069
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I mean, today is another anniversary.

1070
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You wanted a couple of weeks ago and you gave a speech.

1071
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I don't know.

1072
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Two years ago and you said, this is coming.

1073
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And I had you on that anniversary.

1074
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That speech you were dead right.

1075
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I think today is another one where you said in 19, where was it?

1076
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
19, or 2003, you called again for things happen.

1077
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And that's what's happening this week.

1078
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So how long before before we see the real ramifications of this?

1079
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Well, if one understands Austrian economics, you can predict trends.

1080
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But you can't predict precipitating events.

1081
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
You can tell when the foundation has eroded.

1082
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And it has eroded.

1083
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So the precipitating events that causes the panic is an emotional reaction.

1084
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
But the fundamentals are such that we're on a verge of a collapse.

1085
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It could happen.

1086
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
If we do something foolish or stupid or continue to do some things that we're doing today

1087
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
by bailing on everybody any day, and nationalize all our industry.

1088
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Eventually, the world will give up on our dollar.

1089
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
We're still benefiting.

1090
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Believe it or not, with the privilege of issuing the reserve currency of the world.

1091
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And now, so many people hold the dollar.

1092
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
They're cooperating with us on this fraud.

1093
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And to the exclusion of the Congress, Congress neglects their responsibility

1094
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
that Federal Reserve should even exist under the Constitution.

1095
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
There's no explicit authorization for a central bank.

1096
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And the treasuries just complicit in all that we do.

1097
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Economic law will end this eventually.

1098
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I will tell you, Congressman, that I, well, I'm not a conspiracy theorist

1099
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
by any stretch of the imagination.

1100
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I will tell you that it almost feels like we're being set up by players that, for instance,

1101
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
the Secretary of the Treasury right now.

1102
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
He worked at Goldman Sachs.

1103
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
He was a big guy at Goldman Sachs.

1104
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I love this.

1105
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
This is Glenn Beck's Awakening.

1106
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's like, you know, I'm not a conspiracy theorist,

1107
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
but, you know, meanwhile, the back was mine.

1108
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Holy crap.

1109
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
All that should have been reading about the illuminati and, you know,

1110
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
all these different levels in the pyramid.

1111
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's freaking true.

1112
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So I better say, I'm not a conspiracy theorist,

1113
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
because I don't want to be labeled one.

1114
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I don't want to be labeled a kook.

1115
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Come on Glenn, you're almost there, man.

1116
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You're almost there.

1117
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
All of the players, they all know each other.

1118
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's this the old boy network here.

1119
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And they cannot be this stupid to not see what they're doing.

1120
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Now, I don't have the final answer on that,

1121
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
because I'm bewildered by that too.

1122
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You see them making a lot of money.

1123
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
They love the system.

1124
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
But I think what happens is they believe they can control it.

1125
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You know, they have this president's working group

1126
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
on financial markets, the plunge protection team,

1127
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and they're always believed in they can be bailed out.

1128
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
But eventually the markets are more powerful than all those

1129
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
who do this planning, whether it's central economic planning

1130
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
through banking and monetary affairs,

1131
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
eventually the market rules in this.

1132
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That's, you know, that's so right.

1133
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
That is so right, particularly with no regulation.

1134
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
When it's just applying demand,

1135
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
if that's just the only principles that are left,

1136
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
the market absolutely rules.

1137
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I mean, I've had enough education to know that.

1138
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It's, when if it's only purely supply and demand,

1139
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and there are practically no rules,

1140
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
which is pretty much the financial system as I might add.

1141
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Clinton did a lot of that deregulation.

1142
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Darlings of Wall Street, the Clintons are.

1143
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Then the other market doesn't discriminate.

1144
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It'll kill whoever it has to kill to go the way the market flows.

1145
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Those are true, actually, I would say those are true forces of nature.

1146
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
That's what's happening today.

1147
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The market is shouting that you've overstepped your bounds,

1148
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
and you can't do it any longer.

1149
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So it'll bring us to our needs.

1150
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Congressman, the Democrats are saying this is Bush's problem,

1151
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
and, you know, the failed economics,

1152
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
the right is screaming.

1153
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
This is Congress's problem and the Democrats.

1154
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I think it's both of their problems,

1155
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
but yet it's so much more than that because this is,

1156
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and this isn't seemingly getting very much attention,

1157
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
connecting these two.

1158
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
The politicians are saying one thing,

1159
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
but the rest of the news on TV is showing this is a global problem.

1160
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
This is happening all over the globe.

1161
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Is that Congress's fault, too?

1162
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Is that the president's fault?

1163
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Did we cause it in the rest of the world?

1164
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Or have the central banks done the same thing

1165
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
to the rest of the world?

1166
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Let me answer that.

1167
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
The central banks, the whole idea,

1168
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
the whole system built on money,

1169
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
making money from money.

1170
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
That was it.

1171
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That's the whole problem.

1172
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
All these central banks.

1173
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Bad idea.

1174
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Now, the C's were planted in 1913.

1175
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
They really came to the boom in 1971.

1176
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It was made worldwide because we have a total fiat currency created

1177
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
by the Bretton Woods Breakdown in 1971.

1178
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
But the world accepted the dollar as a reserve currency of the world.

1179
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It literally said,

1180
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
you can put your gold as much as you want,

1181
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
so everybody's in bed together.

1182
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So this idea that if you think the dollar is going down in value,

1183
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
that you can protect yourself by going to the euro,

1184
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
the yen, it's not going to work.

1185
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Only hard assets will protect you

1186
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
because prices are going up.

1187
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And the world economy is global.

1188
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Global economies are good when they're market-driven,

1189
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
but when they're driven artificially by central blanks,

1190
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
colluding.

1191
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So it's not just our central bank.

1192
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
All the central banks talk to each other.

1193
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But we and the Congress can't even audit them.

1194
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
We don't even know this.

1195
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
We can find out more information about the CIA,

1196
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
which is rather secretive than we can about the Federal Reserve,

1197
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
and just like the other day when they come up with these bailouts.

1198
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You think they even consulted Congress?

1199
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's been $85 billion.

1200
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And Congress just doesn't do anything.

1201
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
We're nationalizing these industries,

1202
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
and there doesn't seem to be any that much concern.

1203
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Yeah. Well, there is here Congress,

1204
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
but I would take a quick break.

1205
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
We'll be back with some final thoughts with you.

1206
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So there you have it.

1207
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Congress is just sitting on their hands.

1208
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm almost going to do that.

1209
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Sitting on their hands, doing nothing,

1210
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
letting this all pass by.

1211
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
These are the people that you elect.

1212
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
These are the people that you put into office.

1213
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And the same thing is happening all over the globe.

1214
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's only so little more abstract in Europe.

1215
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
People aren't even aware in Europe of what's going on.

1216
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
The exact same issues are taking place.

1217
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Maybe there's a news article here there,

1218
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and we kind of joke about the banks.

1219
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But it's the same peril.

1220
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
They're all on the verge of breaking down, falling down.

1221
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I just got to play this second part of this interview.

1222
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's a little bit shorter this piece, but it's well worth it.

1223
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Because Ron Paul really really does.

1224
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I've seen this financial situation coming for a very, very long time.

1225
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I know that you're being tracked now.

1226
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Finally, the media wants to talk to you.

1227
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yeah.

1228
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You're from me because everything you've been talking about is now coming to fruition.

1229
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah, that everything he's been talking about is now coming to fruition.

1230
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
This could actually be some form of the turn in mainstream media.

1231
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I'm thinking about this more and more that I've seen it on CNBC,

1232
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
which clearly is being used to leak all kinds of news.

1233
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
They've got their operatives everywhere.

1234
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I mean, I'm seeing it literally guys taking cell phone calls

1235
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and repeating rumor and hearsay on the air as it comes through.

1236
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And you see the markets right there.

1237
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You see it react in real time.

1238
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I mean, this is fascinating stuff.

1239
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You are witnessing a humongous event.

1240
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So you do have to pay some attention to television.

1241
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I recommend CNBC during the daytime hours.

1242
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It's just so phenomenal to see the news come in.

1243
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
See the markets respond and see the experts who live

1244
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
literally do not have an answer and how worried they look.

1245
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You can see it in their eyes.

1246
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You can you can feel it.

1247
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It's an everyone's turning around to Dr. Ron Paul.

1248
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Go figure.

1249
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
All the cooks, all the freaks, all the idiots, all the nutters.

1250
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It seems to me, Congressman, that we are ending up with bigger and even more powerful banks.

1251
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
We're losing everything small and retaining only thing that is very big,

1252
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
global and powerful.

1253
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:59,000
How do we ever escape the global clutches of these gigantic financial institutions

1254
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
and the Fed when we are now handing them all of the power?

1255
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
You know, I really don't understand why we feel like we're in their clutches.

1256
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
They don't hold anything.

1257
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
They hold their own problem.

1258
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yes.

1259
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,000
The underlying issues are devastating for homeowners in particular worldwide and what will happen

1260
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
to currencies worldwide.

1261
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We got to go through it, people.

1262
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
We just got to go through it.

1263
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I don't think you're going to go for that.

1264
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I pot upgrade this year.

1265
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's going to be very difficult unless we have a real serious discussion here in Washington

1266
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
where the mistakes were made.

1267
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
If you do those mistakes and devise another system, it's going to continue that way.

1268
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And the big guys are going to end up owning everything.

1269
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You say, oh, no, it's the Federal Reserve and the taxpayer.

1270
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
But somebody's involved.

1271
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Somebody's going to be controlling that.

1272
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Somebody's going to be benefiting.

1273
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
You know, these CEOs aren't suffering.

1274
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
They're still getting their parachutes and their millions of dollars.

1275
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So the big guys are protecting themselves.

1276
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But eventually, always comes about.

1277
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Monterey history shows that this type of a monetary system will not last.

1278
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And eventually, they have to sit down and devise a brand new system.

1279
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The biggest question is, will it be in a free society?

1280
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Or will it be in a totalitarian society?

1281
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And right now, we're moving rapidly toward more government and bigger government

1282
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
and control by big banks and big corporations.

1283
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
There's your choice right there.

1284
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
There is your choice, chuckleheads.

1285
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Do you want this to be determined under a totalitarian state?

1286
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Well, how we're going to re-jigger the financial system and the way we do business?

1287
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Or do you want to do it as a whole bunch of free thinking people can sit down and work together?

1288
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Across boundaries and borders and countries and continents?

1289
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Doesn't it sound like that would be a much better way to do it?

1290
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Ask your candidate.

1291
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Ask these two puppets.

1292
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
These actors, McCain and Obama ask them what they're going to do.

1293
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
When they take over the presidency in three months.

1294
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Ask them what they're going to do.

1295
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
They don't have an answer.

1296
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
They just blow and smoke up your ass.

1297
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
They do not have an answer.

1298
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And they don't want to do anything to change the status quo.

1299
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
They're under control.

1300
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
They've been bought and paid for by the same guys who are about to take a trillion

1301
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
dollars of our money.

1302
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Very frightening.

1303
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Is this, you know, I said at the beginning of the show that I said,

1304
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I don't know about a year ago.

1305
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
One day America, you're going to wake up on a Monday.

1306
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And by Friday, your country will not be the same.

1307
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
This is not necessarily how envisioned it because I thought people would wake up by Friday.

1308
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Is this that week, Congressman?

1309
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Now this is the preliminary.

1310
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
It'll be worse weeks.

1311
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
That's right.

1312
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Worst weeks to come because the seeds have been planted.

1313
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
You say, what can you do to prevent the recession and the correction?

1314
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You can't do anything.

1315
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
When you cause the problem of over-investment, malinvestment, excessive debt,

1316
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
you can't solve the problem unless you do the liquidation.

1317
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And that's the painful part that nobody wants to accept.

1318
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And we haven't taken care of that problem.

1319
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So unless we understand that and the people understand it,

1320
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
they won't know why we have to go through this problem.

1321
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Congressman, I've only got about 10 seconds.

1322
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Yes or no, has anybody in Congress come to you that wouldn't necessarily on your page

1323
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
and said, you know what, Congressman, don't tell anybody, but you're right.

1324
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
More every day, but not those in leadership yet.

1325
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Thank you very much.

1326
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
From New York.

1327
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Good night.

1328
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
America.

1329
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I love that.

1330
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Dr. Ron Paul lays it down and he's not being smuggled about it.

1331
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
He's still ringing the alarm bell loudly.

1332
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Please contact your Congress person.

1333
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You're representative.

1334
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You've got to contact them.

1335
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You've got to tell them.

1336
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You'll hold them accountable for the biggest privacy in the, in American,

1337
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
recent American history and their careers.

1338
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And we'll hold them accountable as traders.

1339
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Absolute traders, because that's what they are.

1340
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
If they pass this bill in anything close to the form that it's in.

1341
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Now, in fact, I believe if at all.

1342
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Let them burn.

1343
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
That's what I say.

1344
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Let them burn.

1345
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Let them burn burn.

1346
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Well, we get sins.

1347
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You bet.

1348
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
No way to stop that.

1349
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But let them burn.

1350
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Well, I'm talking about Dr. Ron.

1351
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
He is now.

1352
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
There's a posting on his campaign for Liberty blog,

1353
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
which I have a link to in the show notes.

1354
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Of course, daily source code dot com.

1355
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Curie dot com where I cross posts as well.

1356
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And he is.

1357
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Here we go.

1358
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
He's endorsing Chuck Baldwin.

1359
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
The candidate for the Constitution party.

1360
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
This may come as a surprise to a lot of non-Americans who say,

1361
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Well, wait a minute.

1362
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Can't you only just vote for Obama and the.

1363
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And McCain?

1364
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
No.

1365
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Not true.

1366
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
There's plenty of other ways to get on the ballot.

1367
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
There's plenty of other parties.

1368
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Cynthia McKinney is running.

1369
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And Ron bars running for the libertarian party.

1370
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And for the Constitution party Chuck.

1371
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Am I saying that right?

1372
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Yeah, Chuck Baldwin.

1373
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So I don't know enough about Chuck Baldwin yet to throw my full weight and support behind him.

1374
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:04,000
But I would almost say I can almost do it blindly if Ron Paul is behind him.

1375
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And then here's a quote that I ran across today.

1376
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It's always a kind of interesting how the quote of the day side always gives me something that really fits in.

1377
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And I'm going to give you the quote first that I'm going to tell you who gave the quote.

1378
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So this pertains to the $700 billion line of credit that under no scrutiny or oversight.

1379
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:33,000
The Bush administration wants Hank Paulson to be able to use to essentially bail out his buddies,

1380
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
fix all the stupid shit for themselves.

1381
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And at the end of the day, still try to kill all of us.

1382
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Here's the quote.

1383
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
If you tell a lie, big enough.

1384
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And keep repeating it.

1385
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
People will eventually come to believe it.

1386
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,000
The lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political,

1387
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
economic and or military consequences of the lie.

1388
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
If thus becomes important for the state to use all of its powers to repress descent.

1389
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
For the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension.

1390
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It is the greatest enemy of the state.

1391
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
So it's pretty clear what the lie is this time.

1392
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
We've heard all the lies.

1393
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
We haven't forgotten the lies that got us into Iraq.

1394
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I would say we have high suspicions about lies surrounding 9-11.

1395
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
But this one, this one, my friends, is happening right under our noses.

1396
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
We've got the infrastructure.

1397
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
We've got the new media set ups.

1398
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
We've got the networks.

1399
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
We've got the links.

1400
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
We still have the bandwidth.

1401
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
We don't have the censorship.

1402
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
We have to tell people about this huge lie.

1403
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And we should just let's be real true patriots.

1404
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Let's be real Americans and take it now.

1405
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Okay.

1406
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Let's take it.

1407
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
We need to take the pain.

1408
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
It might as well happen now.

1409
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
It's inevitable anyway.

1410
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And at this point in time, we still may have a chance of controlling our own destiny.

1411
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Hi, this is Frank Hoover from Seattle, Washington.

1412
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Listen to your show for a couple months now and have enjoyed it.

1413
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So much that I thought I'd pay a little homage by aggregating from your own news.

1414
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Last episode, 791, you gave a reading of the fourth right.

1415
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
And it struck me.

1416
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:31,000
The thought that we could be as weak as to allow ourselves to be fooled and by the sheep.

1417
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And that's disturbing.

1418
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
But then I thought that a few weeks when you mentioned Americans and their caravans.

1419
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Or motor homes.

1420
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I miss your funny comment.

1421
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You said something like, yeah, this was about Americans who have been kicked out of their homes.

1422
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And what they're doing is they're saying, hey, screw it.

1423
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Okay.

1424
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
This is the frontier.

1425
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
We know how this works.

1426
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It was only a couple hundred years ago when this is how we had to do it.

1427
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
We'll live in our motor homes.

1428
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Screw you.

1429
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
We'll survive.

1430
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
We are survivors.

1431
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Look at these Americans who can't get them down.

1432
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So as an American, yeah, I kind of love that comment.

1433
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Especially since I was traveling through Egypt at the time.

1434
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:17,000
So here's my prediction or aggregation or maybe even just plain old hope.

1435
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Yeah, Americans are strong.

1436
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And we'll abandon our government when the time comes.

1437
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And by abandon, I don't mean, you know, give up on the whole bankers.

1438
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You know, it's nice that a little safety net.

1439
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
But the same time, I think, I don't know, it was before my time.

1440
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
But maybe in the six years, we did something like this.

1441
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
You know, just as a people gave up on them.

1442
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And forced them to set up the same straight.

1443
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Or at least that's hindsight or prediction of future.

1444
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
So yeah, they work for us.

1445
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
You know, you're absolutely right.

1446
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I think that there was quite a quite a movement going in the 60s.

1447
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And of course, that all got killed with John F. Kennedy,

1448
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
who I do believe, although, yeah, sure, you know,

1449
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
where his wealth came from and his family and

1450
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
how man he had some of the right ideas.

1451
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
It's always interesting how the good guys go.

1452
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
The 16th president, Abraham Lincoln killed.

1453
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yeah, I don't think he liked that.

1454
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I don't think he liked a lot of the ideas that are still in play today.

1455
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And this seems like an opportune moment to remind us of how great

1456
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
and how courageous John F. Kennedy was.

1457
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Certainly when he gave this speech to the American newspaper publishers,

1458
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
the Association, it's a well known speech,

1459
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
but it's about what he already identified.

1460
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And with his words, which just clinks,

1461
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
they just sound so eerie now to me about secret societies

1462
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
and shadow government running the world.

1463
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And what we have to watch out for it,

1464
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
it warns just listening to it once again.

1465
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
By the way, the quote that I gave you was Joseph Gubbles.

1466
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
That was Hitler's PR guy.

1467
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Press is awaiting a declaration of war.

1468
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Before it imposes the self-discipline of combat conditions,

1469
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
then I can only say that no war ever posed,

1470
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
a greater threat to our security.

1471
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
If you are awaiting a finding of clear and present danger,

1472
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear.

1473
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And its presence has never been more imminent.

1474
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
It requires a change in outlook, a change in tactics,

1475
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
a change in missions by the government, by the people,

1476
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
by every business man or labor leader, and by every newspaper.

1477
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,000
But we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy

1478
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,000
that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its fear of influence,

1479
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
on infiltration instead of invasion,

1480
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
on subversion instead of elections,

1481
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
on intimidation instead of free choice,

1482
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day.

1483
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources

1484
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine

1485
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
that combines military, diplomatic intelligence,

1486
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
economic, scientific, and political operations.

1487
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Its preparations are concealed, not published.

1488
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Its mistakes are buried, not headline.

1489
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Its dissent is a silenced, not praised.

1490
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is preded,

1491
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
no secret is revealed.

1492
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
It conducts the Cold War and short, with a wartime discipline,

1493
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
no democracy, whatever hope or wish to match.

1494
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints

1495
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
of national security, and the question remains,

1496
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed,

1497
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,000
if we ought to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.

1498
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
If you're a crime and America,

1499
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
thus we'll all win free, and I will still be real.

1500
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Condition to respond to all the threat,

1501
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
if we're a crime, because pieces are the soviet,

1502
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
is the truth.

1503
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Just say we will bury you,

1504
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I don't subsperate through this point for you,

1505
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
so shadowing the right thing to do,

1506
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
if the rushes look at your true true.

1507
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
How can I say my reason?

1508
00:46:48,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1509
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:48,000
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1510
00:47:48,000 --> 00:48:04,000
There's a noise coming from the grass and getting to put the words in the mouth of the grass and getting to the nose such thing as in the home

1511
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:12,000
So I don't leave any hope, it's the rain, your stress, your heart's echoing you

1512
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I don't subscribe to this point of view, believe me when I said to you, I hope our rushes love that children to wear

1513
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I never in a million years expected this song from staying to the top of the road

1514
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I never in a million years expected this song from staying to be a topical twice in my lifetime

1515
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Really didn't, with all the Saberadling towards Russia makes sense

1516
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I want to read you something from a little did we call the Declaration of Independence

1517
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are treated equal

1518
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalatable rights

1519
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
But among these are life-librity and the pursuit of happiness

1520
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
that the Secure of these rights governments are instituted amongst men

1521
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed

1522
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
that whatever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends

1523
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute new government

1524
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
There you go

1525
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,000
As we told King George, I think we should tell the current King George exactly the same thing

1526
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And I will be going to the United States tomorrow for two primary reasons

1527
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Well, it's really one reason. My people are there

1528
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
We've got 60 some plus people working in San Francisco

1529
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
They're still trying to be part of the real economy

1530
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And I want to help them we've got some extra projects

1531
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Some stuff that really has to I just want to get finished this before the end of this year

1532
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Excuse me.

1533
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I can't help it

1534
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
But also I think it'll be good for me

1535
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Because I do feel somewhat disassociated with my homeland at the moment

1536
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
So it will be good for me to be there

1537
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And I'm going to stay there for a couple of weeks

1538
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'll be reporting from what I guess will be a form of the front lines

1539
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Okay, along with that with those thoughts comes the army times which is publication for

1540
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Actually they call it your online resource for everything army

1541
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Starting October 2nd

1542
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
We will have for 12 months

1543
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
They'll just read this literally beginning October 1st it says for 12 months

1544
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
The first BCT Brigade Combat Team

1545
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
We'll be under the day-to-day control of the U.S. Army North

1546
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
That's a North Command North Com

1547
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
The Army Service component of North and Command there it is

1548
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
As an on-call Federal Response Force for natural or man-made emergencies

1549
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And disasters including terrorist attacks the army

1550
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Is now going to be I presume

1551
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Pretrolling the streets

1552
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
You need to look through this article to understand what you're going to see and how

1553
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
How the view of our streets actually may change

1554
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Fascinating, fascinating this is taking place right before our very eyes

1555
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It will not be televised

1556
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:05,000
The demise or the destruction and certainly not the revolution so you owe it to yourself to keep your eyes wide open

1557
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And as not a link that I'm not going to read the whole thing

1558
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
It's on the Huffington Post

1559
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Larissa Alexanderova

1560
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And it starts with if you must break the law do it to seize power

1561
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
In all other cases observe it

1562
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
That's Julia Caesar

1563
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
That's the quote that it starts with

1564
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And it's a really well written piece

1565
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Understanding about this monstrosity

1566
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
This taking place right before our very eyes

1567
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And that we should not stand still and allow that to happen

1568
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Please get in touch with your congressmen your representative

1569
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Let them know that you'll hold them accountable for treason

1570
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I got gas now

1571
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Meanwhile amongst all of this

1572
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
The news does still continue

1573
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Pulling this from wired magazine

1574
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
U.S. Attorney General Michael McCasey

1575
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Denied Saturday that the Bush administration in conjunction with the nation's telecommunications companies

1576
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:09,000
He's had devised a quote dragged net electronics surveillance program that funneled Americans communications to the national security agent without court warrants

1577
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
He's saying it's not true

1578
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Remember that name

1579
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Remember that name, Mucasey

1580
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Specific information demonstrating that the alleged drag net has not occurred cannot be disclosed on the public record

1581
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Without causing exponential harm to national security

1582
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
So here's another one of those big lies

1583
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
You know we can't prove that it didn't happen because if we actually had to show the evidence

1584
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Well then it would be harmful to national security

1585
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
You know at this point who cares?

1586
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Let's just lay it all out. Let's just understand it. Let us all understand

1587
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
We're willing to help we're willing to stick up for our country

1588
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
There's

1589
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
This is a link I should have put earlier on in the show

1590
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
From the independent

1591
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Actual mainstream media proof if you can call it that

1592
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Coming from the independent up to 10,000 members of staff the New York office of layman brothers

1593
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Remember they went absolutely bankrupt

1594
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
We'll be sharing in a bonus pool with two and a half billion dollars

1595
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,000
So even at lower levels everyone's getting bailed out and getting their bonuses and it's despicable

1596
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
It really is

1597
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,000
You know when it's your own private company and when you're you got all kinds of shenanigans and you screw up the world

1598
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Okay, shit happens stupid of us to let your fucking game screw up the world

1599
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
But I just can't I can't bring myself to pay you for it

1600
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Makes me nuts

1601
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Ah

1602
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Interesting that a lot of the links on the drop daily sort a drop.au slash daily source code

1603
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Or about the ongoing conversation about vaccinations

1604
00:54:52,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Hey Adam how you doing Dave and Rhode Island just want to get in touch with you on the mandatory vaccinations

1605
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
They tried that in Texas and the governor was making it a mandatory thing

1606
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:16,000
State-wide and there was a huge pushback on it where the congress actually stepped up to the right thing and voted against it

1607
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:27,000
The governor threatened to veto and it caused a lot of controversy and it came out that he was actually

1608
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
One of his largest contributor was the manufacturer of that drug

1609
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
No kidding

1610
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
So your instincts are totally right on and I'm glad to see that you're following this because

1611
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Apparently they've moved on it didn't work in Texas. They're probably going to try and do a

1612
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
USA sweep

1613
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
That didn't work so apparently now

1614
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:53,000
They're going on to the UK in the rest of Europe. Oh, yeah, South America. He's up to good work and

1615
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Got a lot to say, but I'm glad you're on everything you're on and keep with it

1616
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Thanks, man. Take care. Yeah, so a couple articles for you to read through in the in the show notes

1617
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Death toll link to Gardysil. That is the the name of the the vaccine

1618
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Right the top of the story here a

1619
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Nothing I can't even pronounce it the nathalatic shock foaming it the mouth grand mouth

1620
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:29,000
convulsion coma paralyzed a few of the startling descriptions included in a new federal report federal report

1621
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Describing the compilation the complications from Merx Gardysil medication for these sexually transmitted human

1622
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Papaloma virus HPV which has been proposed as mandatory for all school girls

1623
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
This is from June 30th 2008

1624
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Now I think that that you're right on in the in the in the first case. So the the basis of this new

1625
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Vaccination scheme, which is being rolled out worldwide as Merck is a worldwide company is because

1626
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Their patents are expiring on existing drugs, which means

1627
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
You know, basically they make a little bit of margin over what it costs to make him

1628
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,000
You know, this is why you have a polio vaccine, which is cost maybe four bucks, but this

1629
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Gardysil

1630
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:27,000
You know, you need three of these shots so it's about five hundred and twenty five dollars per

1631
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Innocent child that is getting injected so it's a huge money maker and the way to roll that out

1632
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Of course is through legislation, you know, we've never really gotten into the pharmaceutical industry

1633
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:46,000
In any great depth here on the daily source code, but I certainly should do a I could probably do a full show about it easily

1634
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:54,000
To show you how it works and and how they just want to give us stuff because hey, the man they make a shitload of money on that

1635
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:01,000
But in this case, you know, it seems so highly unnecessary and then the second point comes into play

1636
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
What is actually in these vaccines

1637
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
A lot of people are blaming vaccinations for

1638
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Autism and violent death

1639
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Really, you should look at this death toll

1640
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Now this is a video mercury autism and the global vaccine agenda

1641
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Obviously not going to play that now. You should take a look at that. Just do some research on this because

1642
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:38,000
He really is taking place federal documents reveal a total of eight thousand eight hundred and sixty four vaccine adverse event reporting system records

1643
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
So that means almost nine thousand

1644
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Adverse reactions to guard a zoo up from a total of three and a half thousand which had been reported in the document just last fall

1645
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Okay

1646
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Who knows and this China thing man if you've been following that this melamine in the

1647
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:10,000
In in the dairy products that's killing babies

1648
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Now the way I understand that the Chinese already are only allowed to have one child per household. I think that's the law

1649
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And now this one child they have is being poisoned

1650
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I've I wanted a little bit more about about this poison called melamine

1651
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Which is basically it's a cleaning agent. I think it's if anything. It's a detergent cleaning agent

1652
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And this I pulled up from my favorite source that of course will be Wikipedia

1653
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Melamine is sometimes here comes unethically added to food products in order to increase the apparent protein content

1654
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Very important when you're shopping for baby products baby food baby milk

1655
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
There has the right protein content. It can be sold as such standard tests such as the

1656
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Killed dow and do must test eliminate protein levels by measuring the nitrogen content so they can be misled by adding nitrogen rich compounds such as melamine

1657
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
So obviously added

1658
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:20,000
For profit and for benefit of the corporations that are making these products to lie to consumers and kill babies

1659
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
And I think this is a big one. I think this is a huge scam

1660
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:35,000
And we're just seeing this in China, but this melamine I bet you in all kinds of all kinds of shit with they need to up the protein content wake up people

1661
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Pay attention to what you're putting into your face and into your body

1662
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,000

1675
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Let's see they hit the phone lines again for a second here

1676
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Mr. Curry this is a Greg from Dallas. I just wanted to congratulate you on your transformation with Mr. Devorac

1677
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:32,000
And his I think you're you're talking about no agenda from over the weekend. I know exactly what you're going to say

1678
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I'm standing work when he said bomb fuck north Dakota. I knew he was in and it's when it

1679
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Well it outstanding got to go you know

1680
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I've been thinking about that because John kind of sounded a bit out of sorts now granted he was in Seattle

1681
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:00,000
We usually do the show on Saturday and set of Sunday, which was you know my issue this time I was traveling and we had to do the show a day later

1682
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
He didn't have the regular set up, but still I think that in a way

1683
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:14,000
He sees through all of this he he's true. He's a very smart guy. I think he does see the agenda set out by the evil energy elites

1684
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
But he's just you know, he is a kind of guy that wants to back up his statement

1685
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:26,000
So maybe there's not enough empirical evidence that he has or but yeah, I think he's in what we would call the classic state of duality

1686
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I could be wrong, but it certainly certainly feels like that and yeah, because he I heard him say that too. I was like, wow, man

1687
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
You don't usually use words like that. That's mighty strong

1688
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Two more news articles. I want to give you the next one is from the BBC apparently 2% of the pound coins in the United Kingdom are fake

1689
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:01,000
They're counterfeit and it's not easy to tell when you look at this new story. There's actually a little video that you can take a look at

1690
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:16,000
But 2% from what I understand is very high and you can actually still do quite a lot with a with a pound coin, you know, you get 10 of them together. You got a 10 or you know, you can buy a meal for that

1691
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:25,000
But people do tend to lose confidence in money when they find out there's a lot of it that's counterfeit that's going around it and they stop using it

1692
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And thought that was pretty interesting. I had no idea that there were 2% of counterfeit coins

1693
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And then this final this final note that I want you to you can take a look at it. This is revolving around October 14

1694
01:04:43,000 --> 01:05:00,000
And are we indeed going to see something show up that would be of extra terrestrial nature and there's this guy who I didn't know about but apparently he channels information from the galactic freedom of light

1695
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Adam de Grey is his name and he's confirming October 14th as it goes into quite a lot of detail about the size of the ships, how they'll appear, what the basically what the program is and I like everything that's in there, you know, I'm very hopeful

1696
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:22,000
That there is indeed something that will come and save us from imminent death

1697
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
But he, what I don't like, I kind of really hate this

1698
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Since it, you know, when this is exactly what John DeVorek, John C. DeVorek predicted. So he says here, since it is impossible to predict the future this event is in no way shape or form concrete in happening on October 14th, 2008 simply put it depends upon the

1699
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Project Signature of this event and its fluidity within the flow of manifestation between now and this date

1700
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And then the question is so if it doesn't happen the 14th, when can we expect to see it

1701
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:14,000
If it doesn't happen the 14th, it will be somewhere between October 15th and February 1st, 2009. I hate that. I really really really, you know, make it happen already

1702
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Okay, you know, this is how you, this is how you start to lose faith

1703
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
All right, what have we done so far

1704
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
We're at

1705
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Okay, over an hour, I think, you know, I got some conference calls coming up. There's one more thing I got to play for you. It is time for another installment and a perfect ending for today

1706
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:42,000
For this program, especially since I'm traveling, it is Ray on the Charlie bringing you the soundtrack to my life

1707
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Which is kind of eerie because you know, it's like here's my life unfolding before me, but it's also really nice to remember stuff

1708
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:55,000
And the song that he's chosen today, which is indeed a true soundtrack as true track on the soundtrack to my life

1709
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Is one that I hope to play many times for you as chuckleheads. I hope you don't have to play it from me all to see

1710
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
The game won't harm the world

1711
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Let's take a look at the landscape on a road trip through your life, or should I say death?

1712
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:33,000
This episode of hadn't carries the soundtrack to my life, rings us up to a little date, somewhere in the future

1713
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
It's gonna be a sad day

1714
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,000
It's gonna be the day when we are saying farewell to our body and

1715
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Some friends of mine

1716
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
God I love this

1717
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
This is Jackson Brown with the loadout

1718
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Enjoy, it's long, but you'll dig in

1719
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
soundtrack my life

1720
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Eventually, the loadout morphs into stay

1721
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:00,000
This song was recorded live from August 27, 1977

1722
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
In the merry weather, most pavilion in Colombia

1723
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
It describes the daily practice of a band and its road crew on a culture tour

1724
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
And the emotions evoke throughout such an era

1725
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,000
In the end, Jackson Brown backs the audience to stay for an encore

1726
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
And includes an extensive playout

1727
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Adam carries the soundtrack to my life, takes a trip up future lane to his funeral

1728
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
The first to come, and the last to be

1729
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Working for that little way

1730
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
There'll sit out in another town

1731
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Tonight the people were so fine

1732
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
They waited, they waited long

1733
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
They waited, they got along the feet

1734
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And made the show

1735
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
And that was sweet

1736
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
But I gave her sound

1737
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I was trying to love them full and cheers

1738
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
That's the sound they'll never know

1739
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Well, then cases out in the thinnest

1740
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
The hall then trussers down and get them up in the ramps

1741
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Just when it turns to me

1742
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
You know you guys are the chance

1743
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,000
But when the last guitar's been picked away

1744
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
You know that I still want to play

1745
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,000
So just make sure you're got all set to go

1746
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Before you come from my piano

1747
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:41,000
But the bands on the bus

1748
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,000
And then waiting to go

1749
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Gotta run on to the show

1750
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
And to go

1751
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Or to enjoy

1752
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I don't know

1753
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,000
These towns all look the same

1754
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:14,000
We're just past the time in the mountains

1755
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And we're around backstage

1756
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Till the lights come up

1757
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
And we hear that crowd

1758
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,000
And they remember while we came

1759
01:11:44,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Now we go

1760
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Country and western

1761
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
All the bus

1762
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
All the bus

1763
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
We got this way

1764
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:18,000
And a track that presents the studio

1765
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
We got a rule of things and magazines

1766
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
We got troubles on the C.P.

1767
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,000
And we got to retire on the video

1768
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
We got to go

1769
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Or to go

1770
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Or to go

1771
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Or to go

1772
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Or to go

1773
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Or to go

1774
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Or to go

1775
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Or to go

1776
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Or to go

1777
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Or to go

1778
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Or to go

1779
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Or to go

1780
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Or to go

1781
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Or to go

1782
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Or to go

1783
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Or to go

1784
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Or to go

1785
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Or to go

1786
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I'm a soul to stay

1787
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Just a little bit alone

1788
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Please, please, please

1789
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Say your words

1790
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Say your words

1791
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Jason Brown was born in Highland

1792
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Jeremy, who is fathered in her conservatism

1793
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
A self-assessment station

1794
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
He's introspective, very ex-mailing

1795
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
All the more, the sound of the California

1796
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Confessionals in the sunlight

1797
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
The late 60s

1798
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
And the early 70s

1799
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Oh, you

1800
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1801
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I'm a little bit alone

1802
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1803
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I'm a little bit lonely

1804
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
It's steady

1805
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I'm a little bit alone

1806
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1807
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I'm a little bit alone

1808
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I'm a little bit alone

1809
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I'm a little bit alone

1810
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I'm a little bit alone

1811
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Take a little time

1812
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And leave us all behind

1813
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
One thousand four checks and rounds

1814
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
And ducted to rock low

1815
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Whole faith

1816
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
By fellow American musical artists

1817
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
And good friends, Bruce Springsteen

1818
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Everyone piece and justice

1819
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
They're unknown within their fraud

1820
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,200
That poor boys, no need

1821
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:30,000
end rage rush and scrape

1822
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:35,000
They're according to the state and society

1823
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Dunno, ah, there's no rights

1824
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,060
I guess I can't say I had to, anyway,

1825
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:43,000
but it's because we may not believe who this is

1826
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
As if you've brought the perspective

1827
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
All the time, what's he Got

1828
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Still have to decide

1829
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
What you have to decide on the top of his head

1830
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I'll talk shit and swear

1831
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I'm the one who made that I am.

1832
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Jackson Brown, the world out.

1833
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Jackson Brown, the world out.

1834
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Jordan, it's all.

1835
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
So in it, all of us are glad to be lying to you.

1836
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
We create more and talk.

1837
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And give it even life in your after.

1838
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And how about the song?

1839
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Is it the only one you love you or play list?

1840
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Be our guard true, the soundtrack to your life.

1841
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I follow the road trip through his life.

1842
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I'll drop the aisles.

1843
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Rayleigh Charlie.

1844
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Now take care of him.

1845
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
If you like, I'll bet next week.

1846
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
With a soundtrack to your life.

1847
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I'm 18.

1848
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I'm attracted to my life.

1849
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Oh man.

1850
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Ray, thank you so much, my friend.

1851
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Yeah, okay.

1852
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Let me explain that.

1853
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Yes.

1854
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
This is the last song that should be played.

1855
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Regardless of whatever.

1856
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
And I don't want to be entombed.

1857
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
The lady Patricia wants that.

1858
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
She wants to be a lady and a velvet bag.

1859
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
A marble tune.

1860
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
With other people, by the way.

1861
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
She doesn't want to be lonely.

1862
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Me?

1863
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
You can just burn me the fuck up.

1864
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And smoke me.

1865
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
That is a directive.

1866
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
That is a directive.

1867
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
That is exactly what I want.

1868
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I want my friends and family to grind me up with some good-ass

1869
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
gonja and smoke me.

1870
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
And this should be the last song.

1871
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Okay.

1872
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
So, man, this is a lot going on.

1873
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I got to tell you that I feel very, very positive because I can see a lot of outrage

1874
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
people getting pissed off and thinking about taking action.

1875
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
All you have to do, you can do it from right now wherever you are.

1876
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Look up your representative.

1877
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Congressman Congresswoman, send them an email.

1878
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
It doesn't take that.

1879
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
You're sending emails all day.

1880
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Send an email.

1881
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Send two.

1882
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Send three.

1883
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Send 10.

1884
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Send one to all members of Congress.

1885
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Tell them that you will hold them accountable for treason.

1886
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,000
If they pass on this bill and that we have to take the hit now and we should start as soon

1887
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,000
as possible and control whatever landing we're going to have.

1888
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
It's just the way it's got to be.

1889
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Anything else is wrong.

1890
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:06,000
It's so easy to see that it's just prolonging the inevitable.

1891
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Now, for those of you listening, I know how you feel.

1892
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I know that you feel free and I want you to enjoy that feeling because you deserve it.

1893
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And until we talk again, which will be from San Francisco,

1894
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
live your life with passion.

1895
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Another fine, medial presentation.

1896
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Stick it in your ear.
