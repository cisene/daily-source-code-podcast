1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Delta share a Charlie seven nine or three is going to be a great show everybody because I can see them starting to sweat

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
One two three

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Come on everybody from San Francisco

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Are you ready?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strap to my ass

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's a curry

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You can't turn him into a company man

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can't turn him into a horn

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And the boys upstairs just don't understand anymore

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We're the top west don't lack a talking so much

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Anyone feel a day set of play

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And he don't want change

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What don't need to change

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There goes the last DJ

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who plays ready once we play

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It says what he wants to say

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And there goes the freedom of choice

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There goes the last human voice

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There goes the last DJ

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Who's so close to the guy

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And I'm so happy just can't do anything

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
There's something you just can't do

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
There goes the last DJ

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Who plays ready once we play

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It says what he wants to say

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And there goes the last DJ

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Who plays ready once we play

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It says what he wants to say

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And there goes the last DJ

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
As what he wants to say, hey, hey, hey

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And cause you feed him a choice

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And goes the last human voice

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And goes the last teaching

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and goes the last teaching

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And goes the last teaching

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll be home, home, home, home

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, you gonna be astation Donning Mexico

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And sometimes you can't come here

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,800
And I'll be staying here

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,000
and remembering how it was best ever

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And there goes the last teaching

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Who plays when he wants to play

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And says when he wants to say hey hey

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And there goes your key to my choice

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And there goes the last pure voice

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And there goes the last teaching

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yep, there he goes. Here he is right here on your

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Favorite show

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The last DJ Tom Petty and the hardbreakers on daily source code

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Episode number 7-9-3 is the Fubar Friday edition

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Coming to you from San Francisco Northern California

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I never had that on the video for some reason

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's right everybody

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm back in the curry condo here for an extended stay

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
There's just so much to nice fade out

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
As there's so much to do so much going on

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm very happy to be here of course on the one hand

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Not so happy because I know I'm not going to be with my girls for a little bit

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But they support me and everything I do

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Even some of the wackier stuff

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
They're out now I told them you

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You should get some stuff like pasta and rice and some canned stuff

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Just in case right now

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't know, weird shit could happen

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We just might want to have some food for an extra week or two

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I love them so dearly

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And I love you chuckle heads because today's going to be a good show

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Lots of information for you

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Obviously it's going to be pretty much all about the big bailout

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Or the rescue plan

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
As it's now been renamed

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Because I sound so much more friendly

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Now it's Thursday evening here in San Francisco

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's 10 30 PM

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And a word is just coming on the mainstream media

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That members of Congress are now back on Capitol Hill

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And they will work at least throughout, I guess, part of the evening

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Which just blows me away because that's East Coast

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't know if they're working through the night or what's going on

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But as of late this afternoon

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
A number of house Republicans

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Walked out

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
They've walked out of the quote negotiations about this bailout

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Now we've got a lot of data points on the bailout

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And let me just give you my quick assessment

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The number

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This 700 billion or which many say

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm pretty sure that's right

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
More than a trillion

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Combined by the way

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Almost 5,600 billion which has already been handed out

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Not quite sure how that happened

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
While we weren't looking

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hundreds of billions have already started to flow into these banks

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
From, you know, it's our money

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But it's not about the number

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's about the gangster mentality

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Or I should say, Banksterm mentality

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Of this bill where the Secretary of the Treasury

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hangpulse and wants complete super power

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's really what's going on here

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And the numbers, of course, it's crazy

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's ridiculous, it's outrageous

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We've dated it to support that

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Lots of links, of course

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Collected through the drop.io slash

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Data Source code

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But it's really about the powers

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That are proposed to be given away

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's really where the secret lies

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Because, hey, look

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Even if the bank that holds your mortgage isn't in trouble

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That control over that bank will fall under the government

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Because that's exactly what Paulson is asking for

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Is, you know, complete unchecked, no balanced blank check

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
In fact, power, pure power

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
To do whatever to, and you know, in a point banks

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
As helpers and deputies

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And he'll be able to do anything

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Just absolutely anything

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Not just with our money as taxpayers

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But our money in banks

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Another bank went to belly up today

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
In mutual low and behold

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Looks like that one's going to be purchased by

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
JP Morgan

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So everything's complete

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We've got these two major banks that are left

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And now they're really our banks

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Because they can also borrow money

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Fundra Federal Reserve

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That was a quick change

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It was made early on in the week

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Talking, of course, about Goldman Sachs

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And Morgan Chase

139
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And, you know, that's the real crime

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's being committed

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Besides stealing the money

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You know, even suggesting that you can do that

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That you can have these full powers

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's really the travesty

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And that's not being discussed right now

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's about the amount, how much

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And there's a little bit of, okay, you know

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
After a hundred or two hundred billion

149
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We should have some checks

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And, you know, we have a vote

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If you can use more money

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But it'll still come down to, if this bill passes

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It'll still come down to the complete secrecy

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Of how Paulson, who is a billionaire by the way

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I think when he left Goldman Sachs

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He was the CEO of the, you know, one of the companies

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That he's now deputized and wants to bail out

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now, I'm pretty sure his total holding

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Exceed one billion dollars

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't be fooled by the cheap wristwatch, okay

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He is definitely one of them

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But what is so cool

163
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Is that unless I'm reading this entirely wrong

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What is so cool is that we're making a difference

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm hearing every single interview

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm hearing with representatives

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Are saying, hey man, I'm getting too many calls coming in

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm getting 200 to one negative

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That was a pap you can and said

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
200 negative

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Anti this bill, phone calls and messages

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
To congressman coming in

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And congresswoman, of course

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Versus one that might be pro

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
This is because we are finally stepping up to the plate

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And we're doing our job

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And as I said, what you have to do

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And I'll mention it a couple more times throughout the show

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You must contact your congresswoman, congressman

180
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You're representative

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And tell them, you'll hold them accountable for

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Treason

183
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Because they know the truth is going to come out

184
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And you know, you don't have to be still a sitting representative

185
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
To be tried for treason

186
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You need to tell them that

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And it's something's working

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Because now unless I'm totally nuts

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And I'm pretty sure that

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The Democrats, they're all chipped

191
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And they're just robots

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Walking along with the plan

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Because they're proceeds

194
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The ones in congress at least

195
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And of course, not all of them

196
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But the majority proceeds

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So now it's the Republicans who are standing up

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And saying, hold on a second

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This is for this is a big news in my book

200
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Now unless of course it's a total set up

201
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And I have to say the whole John McCain thing

202
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Saying, well, I want to postpone

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The campaigning, want to stop right now

204
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That certainly smells a lot like

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
A leading to a postponement of the elections

206
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So it could be

207
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
This is just a, and this is totally a theory

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It could be that, you know, somehow

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
These Republicans are incahutes

210
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And saying, look, we're going to blow up this bill

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Make it not happen

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So we can really go into financial turmoil

213
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Crisis

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And then of course you get into the whole

215
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Postpone the elections, martial law

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And we all get killed

217
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But I, but it could also just really be

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That a lot of these representatives

219
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Out of pure, egotistical, selfish reasons

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Are saying, screw this shit

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm not going to put my name on that

222
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
People are going to hold me accountable

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
They're calling up

224
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
This is what we're doing right, Chuckleheads

225
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This is what we're doing right

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And I'm really, really happy about it

227
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We're getting pissed off

228
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Finally

229
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Adam, here's the Portland

230
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Just finished watching the George W Bush

231
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Speech

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And think it was a steaming pile of bush shit

233
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah

234
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It was filled with lies of omission

235
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This guy Bush should be in jail

236
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah, hell yeah

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Paulson, jail

238
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Bernaki, jail

239
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Christopher Cox of the SEC

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
To be played in jail

241
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We should throw away the key

242
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And they can take their time

243
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Awakening themselves there

244
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
To dream about it

245
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You know what the nicest thing is

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Dr. Ron Paul, congressman Paul

247
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Is getting so much attention now

248
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
From everybody

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Because knowing the media

250
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And of course, you know the media

251
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
They're trained, they're controlled

252
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But not really

253
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You know what people are saying on air

254
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
There's a corporate DNA

255
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We've been through this many times

256
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And you know what to stay away from

257
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But Ron Paul is now becoming accepted

258
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Because he was the one that continuously predicted this

259
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And the mainstream media loves it

260
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
When someone predicts something

261
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And it comes true like a Nostradamus

262
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Like it's some big mystery that this was going to happen

263
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No, no

264
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
This is what Ron Paul has been professing

265
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
For years

266
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
He's been, you know, and he is

267
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
He's an award-winning

268
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Economic scholar

269
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And he's cited

270
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
His studies

271
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And true and tried and accepted

272
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The theories of economics and methodologies

273
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And the answer has always been the same

274
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And it's not that hard to understand

275
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Even though I'm just basically a VJ

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
One of the last DJs

277
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Even I can understand what it means

278
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
To flood markets and control the price

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And not have a free market

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And now when the market

281
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The market being supply and demand

282
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Is absolutely saying

283
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Hey, you know

284
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I got nowhere to go right now

285
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But down

286
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
To manipulate the market

287
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Even further by putting in money

288
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And manipulating the interest rates

289
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yet, you know, even more

290
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's only going to prolong the inevitable

291
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It has to happen

292
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And the question is

293
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Do we want this to be long and drawn out

294
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Or do you want to take our pain

295
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And I think we pretty much discussed that in the previous show

296
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We just got to take our pain

297
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And, you know, sure

298
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
There's going a lot of people are going to get hurt

299
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But we have to learn from the mistakes

300
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
We certainly didn't learn what happened

301
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
From the Great Depression in the 20s

302
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So maybe it's time now

303
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But why don't we take the hit

304
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We take the pain

305
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So our kids can learn from this

306
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And can see that, you know, the way forward

307
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Is not the way the federal reserve

308
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And the reserve banking system

309
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Operates

310
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The whole financial system

311
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Is built around this concept

312
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And it's not working

313
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
We need to get back to basics

314
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And I think that if we let these guys

315
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Let these fuckers go

316
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Let them burn

317
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Let them burn

318
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Let their companies burn

319
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Let their profits burn

320
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Let their jets burn

321
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Let their boats burn

322
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Let them burn

323
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We'll figure now

324
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
We're going to, you know,

325
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
We're a very resourceful people

326
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
All people of the world

327
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Very resourceful

328
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
We'll figure out how to make money

329
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
We'll figure out what to do

330
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
We'll figure out how to create new companies

331
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Maybe even

332
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Growing food

333
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Real food for real people who need real nutrition

334
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Just a small idea

335
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
There's so many different things we can do

336
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Same way different things we can make

337
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And come up with very creative beings

338
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So I came in

339
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What I come in Wednesday

340
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And I already felt that this was going to be a great trip

341
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Because I did not get apprehended

342
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I did not get stopped

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
There was no secondary

344
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
There was no match in the computer

345
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
On my name

346
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Which means one of only a couple things

347
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
A

348
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The computer was broken

349
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Doubt that

350
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
B

351
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The evil Adam Curry that I kept getting matched to

352
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Has been caught or whatever

353
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And has been taken off the list

354
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It seems to me kind of amazing that

355
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Within the span of five weeks

356
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The sky could have been

357
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If it really was true

358
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Could have been picked up

359
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And the name

360
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Taken off the list

361
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That just sounds way too fast for any government

362
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Institution

363
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Particularly Department of Homeland Security

364
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Which the Border Protection Agency

365
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Is a Department of

366
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Or

367
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Maybe

368
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Maybe all the complaining

369
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Bitching, moaning and exposing

370
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Of the bullshit

371
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Has gotten through to someone

372
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I think the only person who could really

373
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Effect the change like this

374
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
At a level that actually

375
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Remove something out of computer

376
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Is probably a team leader

377
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Of Border Protection Agency

378
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
At probably at SFO

379
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And I have a feeling that someone

380
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Someone out there is listening

381
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
In fact, I know that all kinds of people

382
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Listen to the show

383
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And it is people within government

384
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It is people within the just the system

385
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It is people within the police departments

386
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It is also people within the Department of Homeland Security

387
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
They are listening

388
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
They are not all evil

389
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Just because they have a job

390
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So I think that this, you know, we are definitely

391
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The message is getting out there

392
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Things are happening

393
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And just by, unless this is a very, very good setup

394
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I mean, an amazingly good one

395
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I mean to me, it seems like

396
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
We are gaining ground

397
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
We are not winning by a long shot

398
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But we are definitely

399
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Definitely gaining ground

400
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The Chinese are listening

401
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Maybe not to the show

402
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But the Chinese according to Reuters

403
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Chinese regulators have told domestic banks to stop

404
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Interbank lending to the United States financial institutions

405
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Provent possible losses during the financial crisis

406
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
This is from the South China Morning Post

407
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Translated by Reuters

408
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So there is no more money to be gotten from China

409
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Are they listening?

410
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Are they in on it?

411
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah, they are not stupid

412
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
That is basically what it is

413
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And we have got

414
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
People in Congress

415
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Doing their job again

416
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It could be out of your fear

417
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
For their own selfish reasons

418
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But when I listen to

419
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Representative capture

420
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I think your name is

421
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And I'm going to play this for you

422
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's about, well, it's five minutes

423
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Because that's her time limit to speak

424
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I listen to this

425
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm saying, yeah

426
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
This is the kind of language that gets people's attention

427
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Because now we're starting to simplify the message

428
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And people are really understanding and responding very well

429
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And people are watching YouTube clips

430
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Even older people

431
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Even people who are really, really, really old

432
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Like 72 like John McCain

433
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Which if I hear that one more time

434
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That is as bad as a sexist comment

435
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
An ages comment

436
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
72 is not old

437
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
All right

438
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
72 is just not old anymore

439
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And it's really bugs the shit out of me

440
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
When people say that

441
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Stop doing that

442
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You can come up with a lot of bad shit about John McCain

443
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But just because he's 72 doesn't mean he's unfit for anything

444
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I just disagree

445
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I hang out with a lot of old people

446
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It doesn't incapacitate them

447
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
In fact, in many cases they have a lot of experience

448
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Anyway, so this is a really great wrap

449
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It represents a chapter laid down on the floor of the house

450
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And I got this from cspan junkie.org

451
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Which you really, that's a great site

452
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Because cspan there's so much boring shit

453
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And the good stuff is always on during the day

454
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
When you're at work or at school

455
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That's up melts to do

456
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And so this is a fantastic aggregation

457
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Or a really extrapolation of all the cool stuff

458
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That is on this wonderful channel cspan

459
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Listen to this, this is from the 17th

460
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But now just really making the rounds

461
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It only has 88,000 views

462
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So please, this is the way to help get this message out

463
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You've got to put those YouTube clips

464
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Everywhere that you can

465
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Of the one the example about the give you

466
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But also lots of new ones from Ron Paul

467
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
By the way, another 70 year old

468
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Okay?

469
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So stop already with the 70s

470
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Alright, let's listen to this for a second

471
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Because I just love this

472
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Here we go

473
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Without objection

474
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The lady is recognized for five minutes

475
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You'll love this

476
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I thank you Mr. Speaker and I thank you Mr. Weiner

477
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Wall Street's big banking boys

478
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Those self-proclaimed geniuses

479
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Of high finance are bankrupting America

480
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
These plunders of our economy

481
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Who have fought tooth and nail

482
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Against financial regulation

483
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Now are running home to Mama

484
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Hey, this is very importantly opposed

485
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Government oversight in the markets

486
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Have come begging to the US government

487
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Mama

488
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Mama

489
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
To bail them out of their bad decisions

490
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
They want Mama

491
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That's right

492
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
To make it all better

493
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Mama

494
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The federal reserve and the treasury

495
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Now run by Wall Street's best friends

496
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Have happily been showing out from our tax payers

497
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
More than 300 billion dollars already in counting

498
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
For those irresponsible Wall Street giants

499
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And this was on the 17 so it's already more like 500 billion

500
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And just a week's time

501
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
While homeowners in my district

502
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Our suffering is a result of these high-flying bankers

503
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Self-aggrandizing decisions

504
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah Marcy captor is from Toledo, Ohio

505
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
She's a Democrat

506
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I've not seen Secretary Paulson or Chairman Bernanke

507
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Running around Ohio over the weekend

508
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Expressing concern about working people's houses

509
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And helping them work out troubled loans

510
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
No, all they're doing is sending those folks

511
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The bills

512
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The first check they wrote

513
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Excuse me

514
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That Mama wrote

515
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It was in March

516
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The Fed's main role

517
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
In the Bear Stearns by out

518
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
By JP Morgan Chase

519
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Was a $29 billion loan to a corporation

520
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It created by $30 billion worth of assets

521
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
From Bear Stearns

522
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
If the assets gained value

523
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The Fed would profit

524
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If the assets lost value

525
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The first billion will be lost by JP Morgan Chase

526
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But the rest of the losses will be borne by Guess who?

527
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The American taxpayer

528
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Then Mama wrote a blank check a big one

529
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
To Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

530
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Now that bill is already $200 billion

531
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And could rise to 2.4 trillion

532
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Adds a little more about the cronies

533
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And there I'm sure if you haven't heard already

534
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
There's plenty of news of

535
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
John McCain's advisor

536
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Receiving a $15,000

537
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Month checks up until last month

538
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Even though he lied

539
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And said that there was no involvement

540
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And no connections

541
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And you know what folks nothing to see here

542
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Just keep on walking

543
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Please look at the pretty bird on your way out

544
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Miss Palin

545
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
A blank check

546
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Last year

547
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The head of Freddie Mac

548
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Turned

549
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Compensation of $18.3 million

550
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And Fannie Mae's chief David Schmidt

551
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Received 11.6 million

552
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Directly, not counting all

553
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Their other bonuses and stock options

554
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And who knows what else?

555
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Now Mama has written a third check

556
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
For the crisis on Wall Street

557
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And effectively

558
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Nationalized American international group

559
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Today with an 85 billion dollar loan

560
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I wonder why we just don't change the name of the US Treasury

561
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
To the sovereign wealth fund

562
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Because we're borrowing money from other countries

563
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
In order to bail out these institutions

564
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Now you understand why we have to put more money into the

565
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Kitty is because there's no more money to borrow

566
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So where does that come from?

567
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It doesn't actually exist yet

568
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It's just going to be made up

569
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Electronic money my friends

570
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
More about that later in the show as well

571
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
By the way, from 1999 to 2004

572
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The CEO of AIG

573
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Maurice Hank Greenberg was named

574
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Forbes magazine is among the world's richest people

575
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
With a net worth in 2004

576
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
A 3.6 billion

577
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Dollars

578
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
What a cozy group they have up there

579
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
On Wall Street

580
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
The CEO named earlier this year

581
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Robert Willemsted had been the president of city group since 2002

582
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And his base salary was a million dollars

583
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Plus up to 4 to 8 million

584
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Internated annual bonuses

585
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Plus 13 million

586
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Internated annual incentive pay

587
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And a 1 time

588
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
24.5 million restricted stock award

589
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
To vest

590
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Let me just explain that for one second

591
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Because all of this money

592
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
That they created

593
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It wasn't real money

594
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It was just money that they made up

595
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Because if you

596
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You get a dollar you can

597
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You can lend out another nine

598
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And because it's all electronic

599
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
There's no actual huge heaps of cash

600
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But because it's all electronic

601
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And it runs through this

602
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Basically criminal banking system

603
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You can use your credit card

604
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
To go buy a plane or a boat or a house or whatever

605
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You know, and turn it into something real

606
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And this is the way that it's worked

607
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Since, well, in the United States

608
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Certainly since the Federal Reserve Act

609
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
1913

610
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's a boom and bust contract

611
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Expand

612
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Remember there's only so much money

613
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
That's put into the system

614
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And if everyone's barring that money

615
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You know, in order to pay back

616
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
That all that money with interest

617
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Someone's got to fall off the edge

618
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Or a lot of someone's

619
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
That's why

620
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
The reserve, the central banking system

621
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Of course the main culprit being the Federal Reserve

622
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Would mess with the interest rates

623
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
That is how you contract the economy

624
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You take the money out

625
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You raise the interest rates

626
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You can put money in

627
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You lower the interest rates

628
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That's how you create real wealth

629
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
When people take this money and buy real stuff

630
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Real stuff really houses

631
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
That's the most real kind of stuff you can have

632
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And land, of course

633
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And then when the squeeze comes

634
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
What's left over is the real stuff

635
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And that's the stuff that right now

636
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
The banksters are also with this bailout

637
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
They want to get their hands on it

638
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Anyway, I digress

639
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yeah, so to all that money is

640
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
They didn't, of course, they didn't actually work for it

641
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's just skimming off the top of the fake money

642
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It's just, hey, just put some digits into my account

643
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That's the deal that's why I'm here

644
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
That's why I'm here

645
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
That's why I'm here

646
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
That's why I'm here

647
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I know this is so well

648
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I was a part of the NASDAQ system

649
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Gosh, I could do it

650
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I should do a whole show on that

651
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
In the 90s

652
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And we weren't a dot com company

653
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah, we were

654
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But we started in 94

655
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
A little bit before all this bullshit

656
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
that really hyped up in 1998, 99, but man,

657
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,640
I saw some wealth creation and

658
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,640
bakery and trickery going on then.

659
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,040
It's just a small little precursor,

660
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,280
minor drop compared to this whole financial system.

661
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,040
So I did get a good insight into all of it.

662
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,760
And of course, the big problem now is all these derivatives

663
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,880
and these guys, you know, they're afraid to be each other,

664
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,440
because they're all each other billions of dollars.

665
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,400
That's the biggest problem right there.

666
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,200
All right, Marcie capture continues over four years,

667
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,000
where our homeowners to get a deal like that.

668
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,360
The American people are truly getting built.

669
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,000
They didn't get a fair share of the upside

670
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,160
and they're getting all of the downside in a huge IOU.

671
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,440
For closures are going up in Ohio and while Wall Street is made whole,

672
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,800
the folks back on Main Street are losing their homes

673
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,000
and getting the bill.

674
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,240
So while the banks get to run home to Mama and they are crying,

675
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,560
we really have to ask ourselves,

676
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,600
what has Mama given us here?

677
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,600
What does it say about our values when we pump hundreds of billions of dollars

678
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,320
into preserving Wall Street's bad boys

679
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,520
while ignoring the plight of the American people?

680
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,960
Across Main Street's from coast to coast,

681
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,960
people are losing their homes.

682
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,840
But our Mr. Paulson or Mr. Bernanke giving them any bet on the upside,

683
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,400
they're not even helping them on the downside.

684
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,720
All they're giving them is a bill for Wall Street's excesses.

685
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,760
When Roosevelt talked about malifactors of wealth,

686
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,280
boy was he right.

687
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,360
I feel sorry for our country.

688
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,880
I feel sorry for this Congress that we can't do a better job of standing up for the people

689
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,080
today who are losing their homes in Ohio.

690
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,720
38,000 more perched at the edge.

691
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,920
Our state needs $20 billion just to do workouts in our state.

692
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,760
Where's the federal reserve?

693
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,520
Where's the Treasury Department?

694
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Why do they only help the rich people?

695
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,240
What about the rest of the people who have to work for a living?

696
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:23,560
Like, I can't think when I have been as upset as I am tonight about what is happening

697
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,360
by the big shocks and the people who are paying the bill are getting shoved off the edge.

698
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,040
Wake up America.

699
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,080
Wake up America pay attention to what is happening here.

700
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:38,200
Contact your member of Congress every citizen of this country that is a taxpayer.

701
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,400
And every citizen who owns that home mortgage has a right to a decent life.

702
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,640
Not just the big shots up at the end of Wall Street, up in New York City.

703
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,880
Mr. Speaker, I yield back my remaining time.

704
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,920
Right, thank you.

705
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,880
But you're right on this for a dictatorship.

706
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,640
Let me turn that off.

707
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,880
This of course is a YouTube clip.

708
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,840
You can find that in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

709
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,200
Then people ask me, lots of people are waking up.

710
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,560
They're listening to this show.

711
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,000
They're reading blogs.

712
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,840
They're looking at lots of YouTube videos.

713
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,880
And they're saying, okay, so what are we supposed to do?

714
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,880
You know, we can't do anything.

715
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,440
But this is exactly the right thing.

716
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,880
Spread this word.

717
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,840
Help people wake up and call your representatives.

718
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,520
That really will work.

719
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,280
There's no two ways around it.

720
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,840
It works.

721
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,240
If we can motivate enough people to block this bullshit,

722
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,640
then we'll block this bill.

723
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,560
And we've got to do it with eyes wide open and know that, of course,

724
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,920
you know, there's pain to be paid.

725
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,680
But we're going to get that anyway.

726
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,680
Whether it's now or down the road and probably down the road,

727
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,840
it'll be much, much, much, much worse.

728
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,080
So we've got to go through this.

729
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,840
But please, don't do it for yourself.

730
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,000
Do it for your fucking children.

731
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,960
Let them learn.

732
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,040
I have a conversation with Christina.

733
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:06,200
Christina, not Mike Christina, but Christina, who who cleans the condo.

734
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,640
Well, usually after I leave and she kind of freshens it up before I arrived

735
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,000
depending on how long I've been gone.

736
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,920
And since I kind of spun around on a dime and whip right out here,

737
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,720
she was still working on the place when I came in.

738
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,920
And we're chatting and said, you know,

739
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,200
and I said, who are you going to vote for?

740
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,840
And she said, well, you know, probably Obama.

741
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,120
And of course, I'm biting my tongue.

742
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,200
But I don't know what I want to lay into this whole thing with it.

743
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,480
But I say, well, you know, so I kind of start.

744
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,800
And then she said, you know, I lost my home.

745
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,520
I said, really?

746
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,000
She said, yeah, said about six months ago.

747
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,200
My mortgage tripled by the criminal bankster syndicate who did that.

748
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,040
And she said, couldn't sleep.

749
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:51,880
You know, my husband lost his job in this building alone.

750
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,840
She said, 10 of her clients, 10 have just moved out.

751
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,360
And within the course of like a month, they've moved out.

752
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,360
She said, oh, they, you know, they've been in more job.

753
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,800
Where they couldn't afford the mortgage or whatever it was.

754
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,680
This is new building.

755
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,720
I'm looking at the tower of doom right across the road here,

756
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,760
which as far as I know is completed.

757
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,480
And I can see, you know, of this, what is it?

758
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,200
60 stories or whatever, one of the largest buildings.

759
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,360
If not the largest west of the Mississippi.

760
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,560
I mean, have more than halfway up.

761
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,960
I don't see any lights on tonight.

762
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,760
And she said, she's got no work for you out.

763
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,080
She had one, one, um, you know, she works through an agency.

764
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,440
And they have these buildings, right?

765
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,960
And so that's how they dull out the work.

766
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,120
And she said, he has one client in that building in the tower of doom.

767
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,680
And I think it used to be once every, you know, twice a week.

768
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,640
And now it's once every two months.

769
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,760
I mean, people have no money.

770
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,880
And that's, you know, we fall through this plan.

771
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,640
We're really going to have no money.

772
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,480
Oh, we'll have money because the prices are going to go increased by 20%.

773
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,240
We'll get hyperinflation.

774
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,520
As a couple other links in the show notes that I do want you to check out,

775
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,320
from the market ticker, I will just fire this one up for just a second.

776
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,240
So you can just hear the beginning.

777
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:19,560
This is, um, titled the flat, uh, the, the fed is speaking out of both sides of the mouth.

778
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,200
Right now I watch the market ticker where I read it, um, not religiously.

779
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,160
But a lot of people posted this link to this particular episode.

780
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,400
Uh, what's this gentleman's name?

781
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,960
I forget his name, who, uh, who does all this analysis.

782
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:41,720
And he has, uh, an in-depth analysis of, uh, what, what is called slosh in the industry or liquidity

783
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:48,360
from the banking system, uh, of which a 125 billion has been drained, uh, which really means that,

784
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,560
you know, that, that shit was already underway.

785
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:57,880
Shit was already being undertaken, uh, this, this bailout, this, this crisis was really pre-planned,

786
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:06,040
uh, in fact, uh, a lot of people have, um, I've posted this, uh, where is it here?

787
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,440
Right, this is from, uh, roll call, which I really love this.

788
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,800
Now, this is from, uh, September 23rd.

789
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,840
And, um, here we go.

790
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,040
Uh, this is, uh, what's his name, Frato.

791
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:30,840
White House deputy press secretary Tony Frato, uh, talking about, uh, the bailout and, uh, to move rapidly.

792
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,560
And here it is.

793
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:43,480
Frato said, uh, sorry, I'm, uh, I just lost my, my place here.

794
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,480
So this was like, uh, here we go.

795
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,600
Frato insisted the plan, this is how stupid press secretaries are.

796
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,480
Because, you know, though, though, you got to watch these guys.

797
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,320
This is, this is almost as good as mainstream, uh, reporting by the way.

798
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,560
This has been reported in many different publications.

799
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,880
This is just, uh, the link that I happened to pull up.

800
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,000
Frato insisted that the plan was not slapped together.

801
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,440
This is the rescue 700 billion bailout and had been drawn up as a contingency over previous months

802
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,520
and weeks by administration officials.

803
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,400
He acknowledged lawmakers were only getting days to peruse it.

804
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,080
But he said that, oh, this should be enough.

805
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,760
Well, it was only, you know, three pages.

806
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,000
And, uh, even though McCain on Tuesday said he still hadn't read it.

807
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,640
I mean, we were reading this thing, what? Sunday night.

808
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,120
Crazy old cook.

809
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:40,280
Um, but that this thing has been, been drawn up over months and weeks.

810
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:46,200
Means that all this rhetoric and all this BS about all the fundamentals are fine.

811
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,400
They knew it wasn't fine.

812
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,600
They knew it was coming.

813
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,680
And I think it's pretty much been orchestrated.

814
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,240
You know, it's time to crunch everybody.

815
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,680
It's time to inflate the money.

816
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,360
It's time to take away your shit.

817
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,960
Take it away, fire sale, America for sale.

818
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,360
We're not standing for it.

819
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,040
We are not standing for it.

820
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,120
This is, uh, my own version of something and almost everyone has done, uh, trying to

821
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,240
help us understand how big 700 billion dollars actually is.

822
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
This came in through the drop, of course.

823
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,320
Hey, Adam, it's dean and poem desert.

824
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,120
I was listening to this weekend science and, uh, they started out every show with a disclaimer

825
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,080
that's written by one of the listeners and sent in.

826
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,960
Read off by one of the hosts and this particular one just plays into your conversation

827
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,880
with the bailouts that are currently going on.

828
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,400
So take a listen.

829
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,440
I hope this will give you a perspective of how much money this is.

830
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,240
This is, claim or disclaimer, this claim or disclaimer.

831
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,880
While particle physics awaits the large had wrong colliders returned from the disabled list,

832
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,960
the sign blind scientific community has time to ponder more tourist real matters.

833
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,800
Such as the $700 billion corporate donation given out by our very generous federal government,

834
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:02,360
which is scientifically speaking, approximately equivalent to $191 for every mile between the

835
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:10,360
planet formerly known as Pluto, $155 for every year the planet has existed, $140 for every year.

836
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:17,480
The sun is expected to continue shining, $233 for every American alive regardless of age,

837
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,080
$100 for every human being alive anywhere on the planet today.

838
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:26,360
A mere $7 for every human being that has ever lived on the planet at any time ever in history of

839
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,480
almost sapiens.

840
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,160
I didn't calculate back any further than that, more than $2 for every penny that has ever been

841
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,960
minted by the U.S. Treasury, 7 pennies for every cell in the average human body.

842
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,920
If carefully stacked in pennies, the pennies would reach a height of 69 million miles,

843
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,520
which would be enough to reach the planet Mars and continue for another 21 million miles into space.

844
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,920
In the other direction, the stack of pennies would pass both in her planets and reach more than

845
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:59,000
two-thirds of the distance to the sun. And while incomprehensibly massive mismanagement of finances,

846
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,080
much like the falling out of programming, does not necessarily represent the views or opinions

847
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:08,360
even in Russia, California, Davis, KTVS, or its spent responses. And while recklessly mismanaged

848
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:15,000
finance schemes of our modern economy has cost us more than $2 for every star in the Milky Way galaxy,

849
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,800
the most startling of all these somewhat silly contrasting comparisons is this.

850
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:26,040
It amounts to $1,015 to every dollar spent on the National Science Foundation.

851
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,120
If instead, we had invested that $700 billion in scientific research.

852
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,120
Well, price list doesn't even come close to describing the returns that we would get.

853
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:41,080
Speaking of price list, returns get ready for this week in science. Coming up next.

854
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,920
You know, and I got lots of links, thanks by the way for sending that in.

855
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,920
And I think we don't have to ever do that again. It's a lot of money.

856
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,280
But it's not about the money. It's about the powers that are associated with it.

857
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,560
But if, you know, here's a plan, okay?

858
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,520
For all you guys out there listening who are part of this financial scam.

859
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,840
What you should do, what you should do is you say, you know what? We're going to take the hit.

860
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,280
You know, and we all got money. And you know, having money, even if it dev dev dollars doesn't

861
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,960
matter to these guys because, you know, they've got real estate. They've got real things. They've got

862
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:23,400
stuff, okay? Having money is just not going to matter pretty soon. It's going to, it having stuff

863
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:31,720
is going to matter. You know, just having stuff ownership. They should say, you know what? We're

864
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,480
going to take the hit. We're going to take billions of dollars out of our pocket. We're going

865
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,680
to settle all this shit over time. And that will fix health care. Or we'll guarantee everyone's

866
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,960
pension. Go down as heroes, boys. Here's your chance. Go down as heroes. Not as freaking

867
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:53,080
cowards. Cowards. Go run into mama. It's exactly as the representative said. Run into mama.

868
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:58,280
Cowards. When you see these fuckards, tell them, you're a coward and you're treasonous.

869
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:09,240
So there's plenty of plenty of good links. One is that I put in the, in the show notes, of course,

870
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:17,000
is how to, it's like, although I think you should use your own words. There's a link here to

871
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,360
click to send a letter to Congress real simple. What happened? I don't tell me. I just clicked on

872
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:29,560
that and it's firing up an email program. Is it now? Okay. It's called vote no bailout.org. I,

873
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:35,960
just call, or email. Find out who your representative is. There's a couple of links to find out

874
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:42,280
who your representative is since many of you don't even know. Now is the time to learn. And call

875
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:49,720
them up. Pesteram. Send emails. Now say you want to written response. Keep it going. Keep it rolling.

876
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,200
And help us get back to real money. There's lots of plans. Dr. Ron Paul has a good plan.

877
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,680
pajamas media, which I think is that Michael Moore's site. He's got an alternative to a Wall Street

878
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:07,320
bailout. I put all these links in the show notes because we are being conditioned. Remember I was

879
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:13,800
talking about the money, right? The money is not real. It's electronic, which is the next scam.

880
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:20,360
You know, the next scam to get, you know, when the money's not real, then you can make as much

881
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:26,200
as you want. And you can just perpetuate this. And we're being trained. We're being conditioned

882
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:32,760
for this electronic money, which would remove real coinage, which is really the only thing

883
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,960
we're supposed to be using anyway, which is where we have to get back to real coinage back by

884
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:45,240
something. This is, this is, this is the, I don't know if this is the, I don't know if this is the,

885
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:51,960
I don't know, CBS, this was at CBS the early show. So there's, and you got to see this YouTube clip.

886
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:58,920
The monopoly has come out with a global monopoly game. It's the new international monopoly. They

887
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,880
got the, what is it, Mr. Penny money, Penny bags, whatever his name is, the guy with a hat and the

888
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,760
mustache. And he's out there with a huge blown version of the new game, right? And so you've got

889
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,440
to, it was at Harry Smith, and he's pretending that he gives a shit because, yeah, and I don't think

890
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:25,160
this is a paid commercial. To me, it seems like complete propaganda and indoctrination preparing

891
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:31,080
us for electronic money. And so right now, they've uncovered this thing. And what they have is

892
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,960
all the, the big properties are different places around the globe. But listen to the question

893
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,520
when they talk about money. Okay. What are we using for the new international game? Are we using

894
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:46,440
international money? Listen to this. Montreal and Riga, why got the most votes? What about the

895
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:53,560
game pieces? All the game pieces, those are all new, too. They represent artifacts and from all over the

896
00:41:53,560 --> 00:42:02,280
world. And even the, yes, the houses and hotels are also in the reflecting the architectural

897
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,720
styles from all over the world. I know we have big fake money. No, you don't because we have

898
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:16,680
electronic banking now. No, no, it's all up in the fair and square. And it makes the game go faster,

899
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:21,000
of course. There you go. Okay, can I show it? And we also have, yes, sir, is you must

900
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,040
all show up? Of course. Don't you love that? It makes the game go faster. We're modern,

901
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:34,520
electronic money, of course. Are you crazy for even asking that question? Are you nuts?

902
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,200
It's electronic money, of course. That's conditioning. That's, and that, I think that's the whole

903
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,320
message right there. Because the rest of this piece is such fodder. Take a look at it. You know,

904
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:51,720
let me know what you, what you think about it. Anyway, it is, of course, the Fubar Friday coming to you

905
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,280
from the Curricondo here in Northern California, San Francisco. We're now at, what do we have?

906
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:02,520
The six past eleven. And of course, no Fubar Friday is complete without a test of your knowledge

907
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,840
of popular music. Well, it's not really yours. It's mine, because I'm the only one that gets points.

908
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,120
You win no prizes, but you might save the world with the hit test.

909
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:25,800
Hey, Adam, this is hit test number 140. And we're going to start right away with intro number one.

910
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:35,320
Oh, baby, I know that one. The one known as 100, and as wild romance Saturday night,

911
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,320
the dream, that's what's next. Number two.

912
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,440
Spend no belly, only when you leave. Only when you leave. And then things like that.

913
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,440
And the final one is number three.

914
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:04,760
Very appropriate. What a Fubalese would be your number three young with a Dooby Brothers.

915
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,560
Let's see how we did. And it's time for the answer.

916
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,600
And this is the first answer of hit test number 140. And it's from 1978.

917
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,160
This is Hermann Broth, Saturday night.

918
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:30,760
We'll be open all night. We'll just make every play by the magic of you, Saturday night.

919
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,960
We'll set it in night.

920
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,840
Set it in night is enter number one.

921
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,240
Yes. And this is answer number two.

922
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,120
So only when you leave. No belly.

923
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,400
Answer number two from 1984. Spend no belly, only when you leave.

924
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,440
This is answer number three.

925
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,680
From 1986. Dooby Brothers.

926
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:54,680
And so number three from 1986. The Dooby Brothers.

927
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,680
Fubalese. And that concludes hit test number 140.

928
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,680
So Adam. Yes. How did you do this week?

929
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,040
I'm so proud of myself, John. Easy though. It was not that hard.

930
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:10,360
I got six out of six for today's hit test one four zero.

931
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,680
Use your place to find the answer to this and any other hit test.

932
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,000
And also to find the least. I tuned so you can buy the tricks.

933
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,720
The feature on the hit test online is of course hit test.mevio.com.

934
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,840
This hit test was created using some bites.

935
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,560
But Adam, you should check out the better version.

936
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,000
That's version 361, better two.

937
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,880
Oh. Because I've been talking to Chris Malinsky from a Blackhead system.

938
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,480
And based on those conversations, he has implemented some changes.

939
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,640
And some new features. So check it out.

940
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,560
Alrighty, thanks for playing Adam. Thanks for listening.

941
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,160
Next week, I hope to be back for another hit test. So until then, have fun.

942
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,040
Take care. And remember to try to think with your hearts. Bye-bye.

943
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,920
John, thanks so much, my friend.

944
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,520
Yeah, I use sound bite. I use it for

945
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,960
I use Ableton Live as most of you know.

946
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,200
And what am I using on sound bite? Because I did buy it.

947
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,440
Yeah, licensed too. Adam, I'm curious. There you go. Sound bite.

948
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,480
Oh, I have three dots six dot zero. So I wonder what the improvements are.

949
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:31,400
What if they put MIDI controls into that? It would be just perfect.

950
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,560
That's really the only thing that's really missing for me at least.

951
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,680
But anyway.

952
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,640
Thank you, John.

953
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,120
Let me see one more bit about the US, the elections, the political system.

954
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:50,120
This is not only for people within the United States who, unfortunately, there's a lot of people,

955
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,880
probably don't really know how it works. And they think they can only vote for one of two people.

956
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:59,000
And it's a very unpopular idea to vote for anyone else. But there are more people on the ballot.

957
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,880
There's more people that you can vote for. Todd is outraged about the whole system as am I.

958
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,520
Hey, Adam, this is Todd here from Kentucky and I want to express some grief about the upcoming election.

959
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,920
Everyone is going back and forth with our voting for McCain or are you voting for Obama?

960
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,800
But I have chosen the roadless travel by selecting a third party candidate, namely Ralph Nader.

961
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,800
I'm tired of people telling me how I'm wasting my vote and how Nader isn't going to win.

962
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,040
That might be true. But when are people trying to vote for who they think will win?

963
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,120
It's not some popularity contest. This is our land.

964
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,520
By the way, Todd, that's because we're trained to go with winners. That's why

965
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,360
didn't know more losers anymore. Everyone's got to be a winner. Oh, I should play hot chocolate.

966
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,000
Everyone's a winner, baby. That's the truth.

967
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,000
But that's why it's because everyone thinks they got to go with the winner.

968
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,600
But there's plenty of people. You got to go with your heart people. Go with your brains.

969
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:58,920
That was who's supposed to win. Who's supposed to win? Give me a break. Give me a break.

970
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,720
Here in the hands. I mean, this is our land and the hands of the winner here.

971
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,680
I mean, the stakes are very high. Another gripe I have is, you know, why won't they open up the

972
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:12,200
debates to all third party candidates? People are running to lead our country. Shouldn't we be entitled

973
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:17,080
to hear every candidate's voice? We actually have that power in our hands as well because the

974
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:23,400
they who don't open up the debates is the media. The mainstream media, the only people who determine

975
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:30,440
that is the media. Now, of course, they're they're corporate overlords who are tied into

976
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:36,200
the political system. You know, they pass that on down the food chain. But there's no law.

977
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,880
There's no law that says you can't have Ralph Nader in debate with the Republican and the

978
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,160
Democratic nominee. There's no reason you can't do that. So yeah, you can vote with your

979
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:53,720
feet once again. You can call them up, call up CNN, call up the fair and bounds dudes and

980
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:00,280
tell them, I want Ralph Nader on the debate or I want this in the McKinney in the debate,

981
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,680
or I want Chuck Baldwin in the debate or Ron Barr or I want them all in the debate. And otherwise

982
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:12,360
I'm not going to watch you. I'm not going to watch you the debates. Not on your channel.

983
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:20,360
We have that power now. We're proving it. We are proving it. We can break these decks.

984
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:27,400
We can break them with this bill. Let's prove it. Let's prove it. I don't burn.

985
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:33,480
On national television, it's thickening to think how the two major parties are basically strong

986
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:38,600
army, the less the parties out of even being heard. I just want to know what are the

987
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,880
outrageous over this. People should be outraged and really upset that they're not hearing

988
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:50,120
all the possible candidates speak. They need to be informed to make an intelligent,

989
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,240
smart decision. But thanks Adam. I enjoy this show and keep up the good work.

990
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,320
Hi. Todd, thank you, man. I remember they do work for us. Okay, a couple of things from around the

991
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:09,320
world from the UK. Looks like I'm going to get my biometric data stored into the database

992
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:16,680
in the United Kingdom. Identity cards are on their way. Here it comes. The first identity cards

993
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:21,160
from the government's controversial national scheme have been unveiled according to the BBC.

994
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:28,520
And it will include all of my visa information. So the first people who are going to get this,

995
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:37,240
the first people who go on record, who's, to me it's privacy and thus part of my freedom being

996
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:48,680
taken away. First people are a students and we're where they call it marriage visa holders,

997
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:54,520
which is me. The reason why I am allowed to live and work in the United Kingdom is because I'm

998
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:59,560
married to an EU national. They are allowed to travel and work freely amongst EU nations.

999
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:05,720
Hello, don't try to just show up at E at Heathrow and say, hey, I'm from Poland. Let me in.

1000
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:13,880
Don't think it's that easy. Okay. So we're the first ones. And let's see. I'll have my unique number.

1001
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:19,320
I'll have my official photograph. I'll have entitlements, which is interesting.

1002
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:27,320
So it'll say if I have right to public funds, if I have the right to work. And then of course,

1003
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:33,960
my favorite is the biometric chip, which holds my fingerprints will be on this card. I'll be

1004
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:42,040
on file, unbelievable. And of course, who's going to protest this, right? Who represents me?

1005
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:49,160
And in fact, many Brits, you know, when they envision someone who got married to live in

1006
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:57,640
the country and suck off the the teeth of the British mom, they don't think of me that way.

1007
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:02,840
And of course, I'm not. I'm contributing IPA taxes in the United Kingdom. Income taxes.

1008
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:11,480
Capital gains taxes. IPA counsel taxes. I pay road taxes. I pay my taxes over there.

1009
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:18,440
As I do in the United States, as I do in the Netherlands, because I work and make money in

1010
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:24,520
multiple countries. And I pay the taxes locally. In most cases, that's pretty much the rules.

1011
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:30,360
Only in the United Kingdom, either way, do I get tax double according to the new rules?

1012
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:35,640
Because yeah, sure, we want to go take from the really, really rich, but that starts at like

1013
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:42,200
100,000 pounds a year. So I fit into the really, really, really rich bracket.

1014
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:49,560
But I'm not one of the really, really, really rich. So this should go into effect by next April

1015
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:58,600
at a cost of a 300 million pounds. So we'll keep our eye on this, but it's pretty sad.

1016
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,200
Pretty damn sad as far as I'm concerned.

1017
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:14,680
Good news. Again, the same thing happening. Another BBC story that school is now banning

1018
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:24,840
girls from getting this HPV cancer and population, this vaccination. And there's a video that goes

1019
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:29,000
along with it that you can get from the link that I put in the show notes. I'm not going to play

1020
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:34,040
that for you right now. But essentially, there's a couple of good points. One is teacher saying,

1021
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,040
hey man, you know, we don't want to, we don't want this shit happening at school because we don't

1022
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:43,720
actually want to be like endorsing this stuff. And the teacher who said that was, uh,

1023
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:48,440
I did it in a very diplomatic way, but the intent of the words was quite, quite clear.

1024
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:58,520
But more importantly, there has been quite a number of cases of side effects and of girls getting

1025
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:07,240
sick after they had this shot. We're talking nausea, joint pain, headaches, high fevers. Oh yeah,

1026
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:13,240
it's all perfectly normal. It's all good for you. And it's a sexually transmitted disease, okay?

1027
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:18,200
It's not, it's not like a virus that's flying through the air. You get it through having sex.

1028
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:23,640
Because a lot to be said for giving this, uh, this is an accumulation of 12-year-old girls.

1029
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:28,040
You know, it's been through this. It's a scam from the pharmaceutical industry. And who knows

1030
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:33,320
what else is in this shit? Would someone please get this guardous pill and do an analysis

1031
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:38,680
and tell me exactly what is in it? And with these snazzy commercials on television,

1032
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:45,640
it's disgusting the way we're, we're hypnotizing these kids into wanting this, this, this vaccination

1033
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:56,840
of a disease that, um, it's a sexually transmitted disease, okay? It's not quite the same as

1034
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:05,720
polio. And it does cost about $500 per person receiving this. If anyone has a lab, please,

1035
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:15,320
please let me know what's going on. I'm not quite sure what to make of this. You know, there's so

1036
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:21,240
much news coming out continuously that needs its attention. I mean, even, did you even know that

1037
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:26,280
washed in mutual, essentially, went bankrupt? Did you even know that amidst all of this, you know,

1038
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,240
hype about the, about the rescue plan? No, of course you didn't.

1039
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:34,920
You know, hold on a second. Did I lose it? It looks like I left. I lost my connection there for a

1040
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:42,760
second. Hold on. Want to pull up this from the independent, uh, another mainstream publication

1041
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:49,160
from the UK about this, uh, methane that is starting to bubble up, uh, from the Arctic ice.

1042
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:59,480
And, uh, of course, what else methane is, uh, is going to kill us because it releases 20 times

1043
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:08,120
more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than anything else we can do. It's a, it's a, it's a greenhouse

1044
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:14,040
gas. That's, I'm sorry. I'm saying that wrong. It's 20 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.

1045
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,880
And, uh, people are worried about this. I don't know enough about it, but I did want to bring it

1046
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,200
to your attention so we can study it. Remember, we got to aggregate as much information as possible

1047
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:33,960
on the drop. Drop.io slash daily source code, um, because, um, these methane chimneys, uh, usually

1048
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:40,680
mean bad stuff. And, isn't, uh, a methane, uh, flammable? So, let's, uh, let's figure out what's

1049
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:47,320
going on with that. It's, uh, it's certainly worth, uh, worth mentioning. Uh, also, uh, uh, just something

1050
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:52,680
I just haven't had time to really look into, uh, this, uh, Marriott attack in Islamabad. There's a

1051
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:58,920
lot of theories about why that took place who did it. And I put one of the links, um, into the, uh,

1052
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,040
show notes, uh, called the real story behind the Marriott attack. We can't overlook that. A lot of

1053
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:10,040
people died. A lot of shit going down that we have to really look at. And then, uh, on top of all of this,

1054
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:17,720
beginning in October, the army plunge to station an active unit inside the United States

1055
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:23,880
for the first time to serve as an uncalled federal response in times of emergency. The third

1056
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:29,800
Infantry Division's first brigade combat team has spent 35 of last 60 months in Iraq, but now the

1057
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:35,320
units training for domestic operations. The unit will soon be under the day-to-day control of

1058
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:41,240
U.S. Army North. The Army Service component of Northern Command. The Army Times reports this new

1059
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:46,280
mission marks the first time an active unit has been given a dedicated assignment to Northern Command.

1060
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:52,520
The paper says the army unit may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control.

1061
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:57,880
The soldiers are learning to use so-called non-lethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous

1062
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:04,520
individuals and crowds. That would be me. That would be me. You're unruly, sir. I'm going to

1063
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:14,760
taste your ass. Ha. So, uh, we did talk about this, uh, on this, what the last show 792.

1064
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:22,120
Uh, this is from democracy now. And it's for real, you know. Now, for many Europeans, it may not be

1065
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:29,000
that weird to have the military walking around patrolling streets. It's, uh, it's standard practice now

1066
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:38,040
in many cities in Italy. Uh, it, uh, it happens. But in the United States, it's, um, pretty much

1067
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:44,520
pretty much it's illegal. You know, uh, you can't turn the army on the people of America. It's, it's

1068
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:51,800
written. It's a law. You know, it's, it's, it's a, it's a, it's a no-can do. And the fact that they're

1069
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:57,560
gearing this up tells me that they're ready for some kind of shit because just like they already

1070
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:03,080
had this bailout plan all written months, weeks, whatever it is before, it actually came to a head.

1071
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:07,480
They're prepared. They know what's going to happen. They know what's coming down because we're going

1072
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:12,440
to get our pitchforks and our torches when and go, we're going to go, uh, we're going to go

1073
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:18,520
cost them shit unless they go peacefully. And as I said, I'm feeling really, really good because

1074
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:23,480
it looks like they actually might go peacefully because we are making a difference, my friends.

1075
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,040
Call your representatives. Tell them you're going to hold them accountable for

1076
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:34,680
treason for everything they do. Let's wrap it up. I'm happy to know today, shall we?

1077
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,800
We're the cool stuff.

1078
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:11,880
We're gonna go up, up, up, up, up. Straight to the moon we too.

1079
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:24,040
Hi in the starry blue. I'll be out of this a world with you. So away we'll steal in my space

1080
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:31,880

1091
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:49,480
Dino Washington, wrap it up, jungle, favorite show, seven, nine or three, with destination

1092
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:54,680
moon. One of these days, I'm just going to do another music show, you know, it's just, but whenever I

1093
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:59,880
sit down, whenever I'm getting ready to do it, something happens that I just can't leave alone.

1094
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:06,440
So anyway, everybody, thank you so much for listening. Welcome to the awakening, um,

1095
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:11,960
of course, during the weekend tomorrow, uh, sorry, yeah, for you tomorrow in Australia three days ago,

1096
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:17,960
do a show with Johnson of O'Rack, no agenda, which you can find at noagenda.mevio.com.

1097
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:23,960
And, um, we'll talk to you then, of course, and we'll have lots of discussions inside into what's

1098
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:28,760
going on. And I really will try to put together just a pure music show this week. If we can get away with it,

1099
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:34,200
if things settle down, yeah, you're right. I don't think we'll get to it either. So until then,

1100
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:39,640
enjoy your freedom, you deserve it, and we hold that power and live your life with passion.
