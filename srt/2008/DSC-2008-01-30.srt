The next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I guess it's Adam Curry.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Tonight there's the only one thing to do.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Everybody are you ready?

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Sing along now.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We're going to party like a rock star in a bunch of stiff bars.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Wake up naked in a hotel room.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So my TV at the window, smoke a bunch of endo.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And I've been to get my mind over you.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I didn't tell a phone for the wrap around my car.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And party like rock star.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
After all the nights we spent

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We could ring all the cows.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And all the parties I passed up because you didn't feel like going out.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I can't see you sleeping Tyler.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Didn't put up with crap like this.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But tonight I'm making up for what I missed.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I got a body like the rock star.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I hit a bunch of stiff bars.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Wake up naked in a hotel room.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So my TV at the window, smoke a bunch of endo.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And I've been to get my mind over you.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I didn't tell a phone for the wrap around my car.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And party like a rock star.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And all the parties I passed up because you didn't feel like going out.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And all the parties I passed up because you didn't feel like going out.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And all the parties I passed up because you didn't feel like going out.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And all the parties I passed up because you didn't feel like going out.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And all the parties I passed up because you didn't feel like going out.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And all the parties I passed up because you didn't feel like going out.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Now everybody's excited to see me floating in the house.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And I have a realSAAr Jeep home.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
All theRakes are in my wall, open all of them here.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, a man who's watching me being killed.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And I got my nose open.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,220
You know my dream kind of came true I was wishing for this song to go pot safe

44
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:25,500
wanted to happen as soon as possible I'm low in the hole it's an anthem

45
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:43,060
Oh my god that's a lot of it's daily source code episode number 716 coming to

46
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,740
once again from the curry condo in San Francisco California I'll be here I'll

47
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,300
be here all week y'all everybody before I head on home back to a blighty and

48
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,180
quite honestly I'm missing the girls pretty mighty major mega so I do one of

49
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,700
my favorite things this evening at six o'clock we pretty much done with all

50
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,820
of the meetings we had a nice day very focused kind of skated through lunch

51
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,420
there just a little bit because I knew tonight I was going to be having dinner

52
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,860
with John C. Devoreck I look forward to these evenings because we basically

53
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:22,220
focus on the food we talk a lot about the food and about you know John of

54
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,620
course is a major foodie we talk about the wine we go into great depth and

55
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,140
become real assholes about having to taste every single one before we decide

56
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:35,540
and what we're gonna have and then we have all kinds of talk just like no

57
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,180
agenda and of course if you haven't heard no agenda you can find it in no

58
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,140
agenda that I'll pot showed hot comp and there will be an excellent show which

59
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,620
I'm sure we'll contain information about our meal this evening and we'll try and

60
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,540
get that out on Friday otherwise over the weekend so straight into it today

61
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:58,020
this is it's this is a pretty amazing actually what's going on you know being

62
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,180
here in San Francisco I wasn't able to do my usual monitoring that I do of

63
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,340
the air waves you know as you know interested in what Chris Moiles has to say

64
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,420
particularly when he's talking about me and you know people always think that

65
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,900
a million people have sent me the link and luckily I've said many times

66
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,980
please don't assume that because eventually what happens is no one no one winds

67
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,020
up sending me the link I did get a link today and it was the only one actually

68
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:32,620
let me just see who it was from quick Gmail scan hold on it was from I

69
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,780
think David yeah David Graham and he even emailed me I'm sure someone has already

70
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,220
told you but you had a mention on Chris Moiles show this morning and even

71
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:46,100
gave me the time code fantastic and a link to the to the show now let me

72
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,060
set this up the right way please understand that disc jockies are a very

73
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,580
certain breed very typical type of person mainly very very insecure don't

74
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,980
forget that as a disc jockie now not talking about a DJ like DJ T. S. though

75
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,540
when I'm talking in the UK we would say presenter right a radio presenter a

76
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:11,420
host or just a plain old disc jockie some column Chris Moiles a shock jock but

77
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,340
doesn't matter you're a disc jockie you also play records very insecure

78
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,900
bunch mainly because we have to hop from radio station radio station you know

79
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,140
no gig really last longer than 18 months in the states we always joke about

80
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,780
disc jockies having a owning a you haul trailer because they're always driving

81
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,340
across the country to the next market in fact one of these days out football

82
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,780
Friday please remind me send me an email I've got to play WOLD for you by a

83
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:47,180
Harry Chapin because that is the quintessential disc jockie song so we're inherently

84
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,500
insecure because you know stations change format you're not the hottest guy there's a new

85
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,540
young kid coming in and you move around you try to kind of climb up the lowest

86
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,300
wrong of the show business ladder that's just the life of the disc jockie call me

87
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,900
crazy but it's kind of romantic and I love it and that's where I come from so no

88
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:11,580
different in the UK I'm sure I can definitely feel that and Chris Moiles of course

89
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:18,940
is he's a smart guy and he knows that his audience is not necessarily going to

90
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,820
continue listening to the wireless as they still tend to call it in the United Kingdom

91
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,220
because they're all listening to iPods and stuff on their on their cell phones and it's a

92
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,980
very you know it's a radio one man this is the cutting edge the most modern completely

93
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,340
in tune with the youth it's that's what the station is all about so Chris also is you know

94
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:49,980
he has his eye on this stuff in fact they do I think was a 270,000 downloads a day of the

95
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,620
podcast of the Chris Moiles show so they're into it and he knows where the future may be and

96
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,020
you know he's looking for his next run check so anyway so he had talked about me you know

97
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:07,020
actually you guys I guess I talked about him you guys called in and gave your opinions and then

98
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,300
he responded to that and then I responded and this morning he came back and he talked about

99
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,300
me so more and I wanted to share this with you because another thing about disc jockies

100
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:25,100
we're always communicating through our show the good ones I feel we're always sending messages

101
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:32,940
when we're in love with someone or when we're just horny for someone we'll play certain songs

102
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:41,980
and in fact at one point I had a jingle and the jingle and then I'm talking like 20 years ago

103
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:49,100
and the jingle in Dutch at the time would go and Daisy is for y'all in other words this one

104
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:57,340
is for you baby and of course there was no name mentioned so I could tell five or six women or

105
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,140
girls hey man I'll play a song for you on Friday and I'll let you know that it's just for you

106
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,660
and I play that jingle so anyway that type of communication so it's often and it doesn't

107
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,540
have to go with an announcement it can just go on set it's a song that's played and the message

108
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:18,860
just come through it's little things and there has been that this some stuff has been going on

109
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:24,460
on the background ever since you know Chris Moiles kind of came on to my radar I started thinking

110
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:31,900
wouldn't it be interesting if he left radio one and just it is podcast full time

111
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:41,100
and I'm purely thinking from a marketing I'm coming from a marketing place when I'm thinking

112
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,900
about this and that would be a lot of news it could really get a lot of things going I truly

113
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,980
believe what does he have six seven million people listening to him in the morning he could convert

114
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,900
at least a million people over to a podcast version of his show because listening to what he doesn't

115
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:02,700
necessarily have to be live and I think a lot of people well clearly already 270,000 people

116
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,660
are interested I think we could up that by three quarters of a million get it to a million

117
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,580
really pretty sturdy audience think about what it would do for independent media so you know I've

118
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,460
been in contact with his producers I tried to get him on the phone of course that's not done or

119
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:24,940
whatever show business bullshit so or maybe just you know I don't know I excuse me he's not picking

120
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:33,100
up the phone for me so I know I have to talk to his agent so I get super agent Keith to call

121
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:39,740
over and start opening some conversations and I'm thinking I'm just going to make it really easy

122
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,260
just just tell him and I've actually I did this before when I was interviewed

123
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,700
did I talk about that the other day with John I think Peter Day from in business

124
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,220
and he was contemplating leaving the BBC or taking the early retirement package and I tried

125
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,580
to hire him and I said the same thing that I you know I passed on to Moiles' agent like whatever he's

126
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:07,740
making double it just double the money whatever perks you know tally it all up just double it it'll

127
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:15,100
be worth it it'll be well worth it anyway so although I've not spoken to the man himself I think

128
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:22,940
he sent a me some mess so this is from the morning show now listen to the first thing he says

129
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:39,100
pretty interesting so the song is relevant I could have queued that up a little bit better I'm sorry

130
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,340
all right here you go

131
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:52,620
I like this record you can simple plan when I'm gone uh-huh did you hear that when I'm gone

132
00:11:53,580 --> 00:12:02,140
now listen to this I want to play that for Adam Clarine uh-huh he's immediately honoring me

133
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,820
kissing the ring at the beginning of the conversation you totally guess I was talking about on the

134
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:11,900
show a few times before but I'm not going to get into it but uh he talked about me on a podcast

135
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,620
he did and then I talked about it on the air and then he talked about it again and it's it's this

136
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,700
bizarre thing right and I'm not even going to go into it but um I know for fact that somebody will

137
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:28,940
now send this link to him and then there's a good chance that he might play this again on his podcast

138
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,940
this is why I was chuckling earlier because of course that's exactly what's happening but of course

139
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:39,020
it could just answer the phone I'm talking about it so if we're gonna if we're just gonna do this now

140
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,260
he's gonna talk about me I'm gonna talk about him he's gonna play me to about him on his podcast

141
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,260
and talk about it then I'm gonna go on my show and talk about him playing me on his show

142
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:53,740
we may as well have a conversation so hi Adam how are you yes I'm very good Chris thank you and I'm glad

143
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,620
that we finally have this opportunity to speak because I want to make sure you hear the offer just

144
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,660
in case the message didn't come through loud and clear so if this is the way you choose to do it

145
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,380
no problem now he can answer that and then someone will send me the link but they did yesterday

146
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,260
of me and I was and then I'll we can have a conversation it's part 10 this isn't it just call it

147
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:20,940
yeah yeah yeah sure right I was really funny by the way Chris I know the BBC is really weird with

148
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,500
regulations and stuff but feel free to use any of any of this audio you know that's uh it's

149
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,460
under creative comments attribution non-commercial so you're good to go and talk about it but I

150
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:36,060
will now he so I thought about this due to the week I don't feel like I'm saying he was he was

151
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:41,740
slagging me off from blah blah so someone sends me a link of of him talking about me right

152
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:48,780
and so I'm a sensor and he's going he's playing the clip he keeps pausing it and jumping in

153
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:53,740
laying out like we do with clips and stuff and he's gone oh he's obviously been ego surfing

154
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,620
surfing himself and I'm like oh no I wasn't now I'll put my hands up if I you know if I was

155
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,220
he certainly knows what the concept is it's okay Chris it's all right we all do it

156
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,220
it's like whanking you know of course we all ego surf are you kidding I've got bookmarks

157
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,300
that's the only way I stay in tune with myself I'll I'll search myself everyone's the blame

158
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,740
I didn't see what's on the internet of course you were bothered but on this particular

159
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:23,260
occasion I wasn't so I'm listening to this yesterday in my flat and I'm putting it on a washing

160
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,100
up doing what I was doing and he's talking about me and there's a really funny bit where I'm

161
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:33,340
I said on our show I'm listening to this guy on his podcast I said I'm Korean he's calling me a

162
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:39,820
banker and all this stuff like that and he pausing goes I never called him a banker a banker and I'm

163
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,940
like right okay so let me correct he didn't call me a banker he called me the W word which

164
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,460
but I can't say it I've never said that I never said that that's really interesting

165
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:58,060
of all the things you can't say on the on the BBC you can't say wanker I mean I hear a lot worse

166
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,020
oh my goodness I know this is whole thing it has to be as the watershed and after nine o'clock

167
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:08,460
and that's when you can really open up and that's why big brother live is such a problem

168
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:15,900
and divina always has to say please don't swear you're on ITV live but uh wanker

169
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:21,260
come on that that seems pretty tame I'm actually shocked by that I think that's a perfectly

170
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:27,340
valid word and does not offend anyone because you know we all do it and I'm like

171
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:33,420
just the weirdest well like two children who have never met anyway he's American guy but turns out

172
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,300
he lives here which I didn't realize so he's based here all the time he lives here now

173
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:46,460
not just here I live in the affluent suburb of seri known as gilford so hi Adam all right

174
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:51,660
well go ahead yeah you should hook up for pod then yeah well let's do that now

175
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,060
I just play the sound effects of beer pour it and then class check it and then we when he plays

176
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:02,620

177
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:09,020
thanks for asking have a great show all right anyway so I just want to make sure Chris that you

178
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:16,460
understand and this is an official offer and I speak on authority we will double your salary actually

179
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:23,740
I I googled that the other day I thought that there was a isn't like 630,000 let me just see

180
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,260
Chris Moile salary that always works here we go okay so according to Wikipedia and we all know

181
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:36,860
Wikipedia is absolute gospel Chris makes 630,000 pounds per year I mean it's still obviously

182
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:46,380
an obscene amount but Chris I'll double the salary okay so that's what is that 1.26 million

183
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,700
and we'll build it if you don't have a studio at home we'll build a studio at home so that you know

184
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,780
you don't have to go you know you don't have to get up early in the morning you can do the show

185
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:01,180
kind of like if you want in the afternoon or in the evening or whenever you fancy whenever you

186
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:07,180
feel like it and well and in fact what is the term of your contract will double that and guarantee it

187
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:15,020
because dude you would be you're already major you would be legendary and and by the way it's got to

188
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:21,420
be hurting you that guys like Jonathan Ross and Terry Wogan for Chris takes how much money they're

189
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,020
making they're making so much more money than you and Terry Wogan shows up at 730 and leaves at 9

190
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:34,700
if he's there at all of course his audience still listens to the wireless and your audience Chris

191
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:42,460
is listening to their iPod so once again double and if that's not the right amount just bring

192
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,740
your pay stub and we'll double it and if you don't think we're not good for it first of all we're

193
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:54,460
making money second of all look at who's who our partner is in the UK British telecom look at who the

194
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:01,900
CEO is Ben for Vine he's a Dutch guy you know I know him you know I've done and do business with

195
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:08,300
them these guys are complete marketers they understand they'll back it it would be a cool Chris I'm

196
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:13,740
telling you it would be awesome and since you were so nice to play a song for me I'd like a

197
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:21,340
play a song for you the kind of song that you will enjoy playing that you cannot play now at least if

198
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:37,100
you can't say a whanker I'm sure you couldn't play this song you'll have one too

199
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:51,180
I take a look at my enormous penis and my troubles start a melt away

200
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:59,180
I take a look at my enormous penis and the happy times are coming to stay

201
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:07,180
I got a saying and I dance when I glancing my pants I end up feeling like a sunshine day

202
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:15,340
I take a look at my enormous penis and everything is going my way

203
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,260
I don't go in

204
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,300
Okay, that was just about the dumbest thing I've ever did sorry about that

205
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,740
Here I am throwing around big wads of cash and I can't even get the microphone to turn up

206
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,020
Were you reaching for the iPod were you thinking oh my god something broke something's not right

207
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,340
Well we all had that experience

208
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:08,140
Hundreds of thousands of just simultaneously did exactly the same thing all over the globe just consider that for a second

209
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,780
Let me see

210
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:16,220
Actually what I was doing as I was over in a Google notebook seen what else you guys have sent in

211
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,900
a little bit of political stuff. This is from Kentson Foster

212
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:28,620
Actually the email caught my eye of course because of the subject line often underused the subject line boy

213
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,940
Will you get my attention if you have the right subject line?

214
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,460
Subject thank you for supporting John McCain for president

215
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,700
That got my attention seeing as I'm not supporting him that's right

216
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:45,340
Kentson says that hypocritical scumbag who was always bitching about campaign finance reform

217
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,780
has decided to get matching funds so that we the taxpayers can fund his campaign

218
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,860
and then he also

219
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:02,700
Posted a link to a YouTube video of a John McCain at one of the caucuses saying he thinks we should stay in Iraq for a hundred years

220
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,020
Yeah, take that one

221
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,900
Interesting

222
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,620
See this is actually

223
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,820
Is this something I wrote down myself? I wanted to talk about

224
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,780
Davo and the or Davos I guess

225
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,260
How are you pronounce it in the world economic forum?

226
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:26,460
But I'm actually going to save that. I know people don't like it when I talk about stuff on on the daily source code and then repeat the same

227
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,180
Topic or get into it with with with John C Devorek on Noah gender

228
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,700
I want to keep this one for for Noah gender because I I really got something to say about that

229
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,340
Okay, some more demographic date actually that's kind of fun you've been a lot of human sending in

241
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:43,420
Says sergio. However, I might not be your typical listeners since I got to listen to the chuck through your relationship with Devorek

That wasn't the one that stopped

291
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:57,580
This is the one I was talking about I think I've been playing this for the past two years and whenever you feel good

292
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,300
Even a way you don't feel good. This is the song that can bring you up

293
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,100
It's the latest of the new dawn

294
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,300
And it's a good day

295
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,300
We don't talk about the bad days

296
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,100
Every day is a good day

297
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,140
We are

298
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:39,180

I take up the prep alone still took capacity. It's got to be a good day because it has to be

300
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:50,620
Touch out my arms I take a lot my worries that you've been aided no end of the possibility

301
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:57,580
For mine it feels my blood like I am I still becomes cold as I swing from the bottom of the store with time

302
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,980
I finally feel five days as you should be of my own design

303
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,260
No belong like needed when I rest sleep and dream I

304
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,100
Circadian rhythms are all that I need and I choose a bad day

305
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,500
And I don't choose the creep because you can't have a good day unless you believe

306
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,780
Every day good and bad are both here round to those focus on nothing but the positive snow

307
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,620
I don't want to talk about the bad days

308
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,940
We're my friend all the fact that we are here

309
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:38,300
And that makes the day a good day

310
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:53,740
We're my friend all the fact that we are here

311
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:03,020
And that makes the day a good day

312
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:08,460
And that makes the sun find the horizon long shadows reduce.

313
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,420
We're Britney beach and bосьers snow

314
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:19,980
We're sparkling with blue paint in the room

315
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,240
Is like this we come destroying the room

316
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,500
We're going to see the process

317
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,420
We're going to save the 300

318
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,980
And the lights are dark, it's our secret to dumbness

319
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,380
And they can keep the smartest

320
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,380
I learned about perspective between the close and the pharmacy

321
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,860
I've been the partner in the season of the harvest

322
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,780
They've just learned you still the seeds and I

323
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,980
Leave it the hardest

324
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,740
Every day couldn't bear it both

325
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,500
Be around what's in it was focused on

326
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,780
Nothing's up the positive so the good day

327
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:57,180
I don't want to talk about the bad day

328
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:03,580

Oh yeah, I ain't alone go away
