00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
The guys had basically had a small hit

184
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
themselves in the army now

185
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Which you might know is covered by status quo

186
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Then they created this rock me on Madeo's

187
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
They recorded with this Austrian dude

188
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Who I guess was kind of like taking

189
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Almost like a classical

190
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Cruner type guy and remixing him

191
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
And the record really didn't do anything

192
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Until there was another remix was done

193
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Which of course this was the basis of this DJ Schmolley track

194
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
And it went to number one in the states and of course

195
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
So known worldwide

196
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,500
And I've met Falco a couple

197
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
He's dead now

198
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
He passed away

199
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Maybe 10 years ago

200
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Maybe a longer

201
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
I met him a couple of times

202
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
In my many

203
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Music video

204
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Rich Day's

205
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Guy was always fucking hammered

206
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
I'm amazed he lasted as long as he did

207
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Of course linked to that song in the show

208
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Notes of DailySourceCode.com

209
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Everybody how you doing it is

210
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
DailySourceCode episode number

211
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
719 coming to you from the curry manner

212
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,500
My name is Adam Curry. We're on the west side of G-Town

213
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,500
I had a meeting this morning that was a cancel

214
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Which is kind of good because I gave me a little extra time

215
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,500
To go through some of the phone in comments

216
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
That you guys have been dialing in for the past two days

217
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,500
I got to tell you every single time and there are hundreds of them

218
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,500
And each one of them can last a maximum of three minutes

219
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
So usually it's about a hundred minutes

220
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
That I'm just listening to what you guys are calling in

221
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,500
About and of course some of them I just listened to

222
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Halfway if the quality is too shith

223
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,500
And I just dump it immediately but still it's a good hour hour and a half

224
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,500
But every single time I go through those voice mail comments

225
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,500
And now you guys are getting to the habit of telling me a bit about yourself

226
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
You know some demographic information

227
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,500
You really you turn me on you get me excited to do the show

228
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Like oh, yeah, this is great. Oh, yeah, I can't wait to play this

229
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,500
And so I thank you very much. I really do

230
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Hey, Adam, it's Laura Clark

231
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,500
One to call and leave a message because I don't think that I have before

232
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,500
So thanks for playing the dirty shirt song on the DailySourceCode

233
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,500
I always appreciate the podcast love from my favorite podcast

234
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Thanks a lot

235
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Alright, baby. Thank you. Can't wait to see you perform live one of these days

236
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,500
I think she's a Nashville. I think I think I think I think I think I need to get my ass down the Nashville

237
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
That's for sure

238
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Super Tuesday past

239
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,500
I guess sometime later on today will have some official results

240
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,500
But I think it's pretty clear

241
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,500
It does indeed look like a Clinton on the

242
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Or at least has the indication. I mean Jesus

243
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Excuse me for taking the Lord's name in vain, but you know the way they're presenting it here last night

244
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,500
It was as if it was the presidential nomination or election process itself

245
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,500
You know we still have until November until we get to the big election

246
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,500
And then before then we still have the the national conventions for the Democrats and Republicans

247
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Where the official word will of course will be handed out about who is going to be running on each ticket

248
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,500
And then we have all kinds of independence who could come sliding in like Bloomberg

249
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
I mean but the way it was presented yesterday search

250
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Whatever

251
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Was in in Washington and you know sometimes he would even say

252
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,500
After tonight will know who will who will be running the country

253
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Yeah, he's like will it be a black man will it be a woman or will it be a war veteran?

254
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,500
I'm sure Trevor do chill. You know we're not quite there yet

255
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Anyway, I'm sure you've had enough you probably had an overload of that and you may not be looking forward to

256
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,500
I may not be looking forward to more on today's show about that

257
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Um

258
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Just checking in with the writers guild of America

259
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,500
I'll just read this verbatim rumors continue to swirl and Hollywood that both writers guild of America

260
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Leadership in the conglomerates at hammered out a tentative deal

261
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Um, well

262
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Says the

263
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Say the officials what we've met and we made some important progress

264
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
And so we re-engaged in serious talks

265
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Regardless of what you may hear or read there are many significant points that have yet to be worked out

266
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Mark Yoshimata anemkov had a a very interesting interview with a Los Angeles screenwriter

267
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:32,500
And I guess producer I could find it for you could let you know what what episode that was on

268
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Um, but it it's interesting you know as I was listening to this conversation

269
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,500
I'm thinking you know yeah first the two things that that really made me think

270
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,500
The first one is this strike really has crippled a lot of people

271
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,500
It's not just the writers because these shows essentially are now shutting down or they have shut down

272
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,500
So that means that of course producers actors

273
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Uh, writers sound engineers lighting engineers electricians stage hands catering companies

274
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Uh, everyone is suffering dellies around the corner everyone is suffering from this and that is really hurting

275
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,500
I think a sizable a sizable

276
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,500
I'm trying to think if I'm a great number of people

277
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,500
I think that's what I'm supposed to say it a sizable amount would that be fair to say

278
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,500
So that's one part of it and a lot of these issues

279
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Are very very complicated because there's just so much unknown about making money with video online

280
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Now I have to say that

281
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:36,500
We have no problem doing it and we apparently have no problem giving people

282
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,500
A fair share because they're sticking with us and people are enjoying it

283
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Oh, yes, they were so beautiful

284
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,500
We had a meeting with the UK producers

285
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Um, a good number of the UK producers on the BT Pod Show network

286
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:56,500
And we had Moody and talk about all the marketing and some of the campaigns that we'll be working on

287
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
He flew in from San Francisco and we had the whole crew was great, you know?

288
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,500
And there were guys there ranging from 18 to 50 probably

289
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:08,500
And one of them one points to it up and said, well, you know, this campaign is basically paying for my mortgage

290
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
And you know, you just kind of said it like that and

291
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,500
And I was sitting towards the back of the room and I just couldn't help but smile

292
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
You know, it's like, yeah, that makes me very happy

293
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Here's a guy making some shows doing what he wants to do when it's paying for his mortgage

294
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,500
And I got to tell you I was just tickled pink

295
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Anyway, so what I'm thinking though

296
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Is this good act?

297
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Here's something that is a scenario that could happen

298
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Because, you know, essentially what has gone off air are the series

299
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
The scripted dramas, I should say

300
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
So a lot of my favorite shows

301
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
Lost, um, 30 rock

302
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Studio 60 on Sunset

303
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
I love those shows

304
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,500
But also there's, um, Lord knows, Grey's Anatomy

305
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
And I don't know, just all of those series

306
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
And those are now shut down

307
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
But what's happened is the television networks

308
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
The television networks

309
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Have

310
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Have essentially filled that up

311
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
Now remember that they do have

312
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
The daytime soaps continue

313
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Because they, I guess they got secretaries to write

314
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
It doesn't really matter, you know

315
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Anyone could write those, they don't seem too hard

316
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Although there are some larger plot lines

317
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
That have to be kept in check

318
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
And I'm sure that

319
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
In fact, I know that some of the writers

320
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Are basically scabs are crossing the

321
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
The picket lines and are working on that

322
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
There's all kinds of ways you can get around it

323
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Basically by claiming

324
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Uh, an economic, uh, dire necessity

325
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Which is kind of weird

326
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
It kind of takes away the whole idea of striking

327
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,500
But anyway, that's, it's not from me to have an opinion on that necessarily

328
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Then there's the, uh, the late night talk shows

329
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Which, uh, certainly Letterman has, uh, has his writers back

330
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
You know, that's kind of a gray area for me

331
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
Uh, news has all of its writers

332
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
And of course reality shows

333
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
What we loosely call reality shows

334
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
Probably should call them unscripted drama

335
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
So we have American Gladiator

336
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,500
And of course, there's another season of American Idol that's kicked off

337
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
And what I believe will happen

338
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,500
If the mainstream media really is as money grubbing

339
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
And evil as we make them out to be

340
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,500
They'll look at their statement at the end of the day

341
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
At the balance of the books and say, hey, you know what?

342
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Uh, we did about the same in revenue

343
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
That we would have done with all those expensive shows

344
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,500
But, uh, we didn't have to pay for expensive shows

345
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,500
So why wouldn't we just do more of these reality type shows

346
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
Until people get tired of them

347
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,500
I think that's a scenario that is very real could actually happen

348
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
So we'll have to see how all that plays out

349
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,500
But I, uh, I certainly, um, in favor of unions

350
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,500
And I certainly, uh, I would not cross a picket line never have

351
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
In my life

352
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
And, uh, I support, uh, what the WGA is doing

353
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,500
And I do understand it's, it's a very, it's not so cut and dry

354
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Is just giving them a percentage of the proceeds

355
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
It's just not that simple

356
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
In fact, that's the one thing that the, um,

357
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,500
The television producers and studios absolutely don't want to talk about

358
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
So anyway

359
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Peace and love to y'all

360
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Power to you, hope everything works out, love you

361
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Mean it

362
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
Hey, this is another one of those calls that I heard when

363
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Oh man, this just makes me feel great

364
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Hey, Adam, hey, this is a marching Los Angeles

365
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
A little bit about me

366
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Um, I'm listening to 17, I realize that

367
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
And there is a bunch of 40 somethings out there

368
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Listening to your, um,

369
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
I do like listening to your show

370
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
It makes today

371
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
And, uh, I'm 45

372
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
I'm in Los Angeles, I'm in sales

373
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Uh, basically I work sales results

374
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
I'm in the city

375
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Half the time I'm listening to

376
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Podcast and the other

377
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
I'm looking for a place to take a piss

378
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
You can't pay any place

379
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
You can't stop

380
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Yeah, dude, you know what you need to do with all those pilots do

381
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
You got that little, you know, uh,

382
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
What do we call it?

383
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Johnny something?

384
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Well, basically it's, uh,

385
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
It's a red, uh,

386
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
It's a red plastic bottle with a

387
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
larger or wider than normal mouth

388
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
You know,

389
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
In fact, uh, on the next plane that I hope to buy

390
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,500
When I have time and when I learn how to fly it is uh, the king air

391
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,500
I'm looking at like the, the, the 90 GX

392
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Or GT, it's a beautiful plane

393
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
It's turbo prop

394
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Uh, and I have flown in one a couple of times

395
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
And they have a front, they have a relief tube

396
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
So there is a bathroom in this plane

397
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
Which is kind of, you know,

398
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
It's, it's like a bucket with a curtain

399
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Okay, but it is a real toilet

400
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
You can use it and you can use it in some privacy

401
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,500
But upfront, uh, they have relief tubes and uh,

402
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
It's literally what's called it

403
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
And you have to imagine it's, uh,

404
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,500
It's a rubber hose and attached to it is a black funnel

405
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,500
And there's a little, uh, a little lever on it

406
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
And essentially you, uh, you would attach it

407
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
To your member, you press the lever

408
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
So the, uh, the valve is opened

409
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
And you do your business

410
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
And, uh, and make use of the relief tube

411
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
I think you do one of those

412
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,500
The alternative, as I said, is, uh, is the, is the, is the, the port of Johnny

413
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Just the, uh, the red plastic bottle with the somewhat wider mouth

414
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Wait, you may not need a wide mouth, by the way

415
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
The bathroom, everybody's so busy

416
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
I just need to put a push party with me

417
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Exactly

418
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Anyways, um, you, you and the DNSC

419
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,500
And the listeners and the music, uh, it's inspired me

420
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Uh, I kind of love with music again

421
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Because of podcasting

422
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Absolutely, love music

423
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
It, it brought me back to life

424
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,500
And it is the use to make me live to be happy

425
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
To be free

426
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
I share your politics, uh, unfortunately

427
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
I don't know what it is about, uh, you know,

428
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,500
2008 and where we live right now and why people are out

429
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Rage and where they go

430
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
I do blog, I do respond to the best I can

431
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,500
But, uh, if we were to see, if we really, really

432
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,500
We're to see the, the true stuff that we are

433
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Not allowed to see, the ugliness

434
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
I believe that our world would change

435
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
And that's the beauty about podcasting

436
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
That's the beauty about the, the internet

437
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
That's the beauty about, uh, the future of, uh,

438
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
The ubiquitous internet access

439
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
I believe in it wholeheartedly

440
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
I thank you, um, and me

441
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Before you get into the, thank you

442
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
I agree with you on, uh, on that

443
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
And you, you sound, uh, actually you sound

444
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Very patriotic and you get my blood cook

445
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
And I like that a lot, you know

446
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,500
And, um, and to, you know, we, we spend a lot of time uncovering

447
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
All the ugliness. It's kind of

448
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
I've been thinking about this a lot

449
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Over the past couple days

450
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
What we, no longer really highlight

451
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Is the beauty of life. We're, we're not really good at that

452
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,500
And whenever we encounter it, we all do kind of love it

453
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Um, but we're not showing enough of it

454
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
In fact, uh, I've been thinking of an experiment

455
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
As a exercise we can do

456
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Well, uh, I'll, I'll let, uh, let our LA sales

457
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Weasel visit. By the way,

458
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
I think we can give you the official title. LA sales

459
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Weasel calling any time. I'm pretty

460
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
You, uh, not only change my life

461
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Because of podcasting. I have a life

462
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,500
And I look forward to the DSC. I look forward to the

463
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Great, great talent out there

464
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
And, uh, just, uh, thank you very much

465
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Um, anyways, uh, I don't know about your hair, but, uh,

466
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Love it anyways. All right, it's all the best

467
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
All right, I'd love you, mean it. No homo

468
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
I just have my hair cut by the way

469
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
It's no longer as big as it was

470
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
I need to, uh, definitely need to trim

471
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,500
So yeah, so this happens. I come home and, uh, like last night

472
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
You know, when I'm in the city, I usually can't make it home

473
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Before 8 or 830. It's just the way the traffic flows

474
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
And, uh, you know, Patricia always buys her new

475
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Spapers. We have two times of new newspapers

476
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
In the house. We have Patricia's new

477
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Spapers and my new Spapers. You know, it's the financial

478
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Times FT. Uh, that's the only one I'll read. Of course, now I've, uh,

479
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Taking up the economist as well, but that's, that's about it.

480
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,500
And her newspapers always feature, um, one of the following, uh,

481
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Madeline McCain on the front page, uh, Heather McCartney,

482
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Uh, Brittany Spears, Amy Winehouse, anything but news

483
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Basically. And I've noticed that, um, you know,

484
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,500
People say, well, you know, the mainstream media, they're doing this

485
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Just to brainwash us and just to keep us occupied and

486
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
It's not really that way in my opinion.

487
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,500
We are keeping ourselves occupied with that. It's,

488
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,500
It's a form of drugs, really. Um, we need to escape.

489
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Everyone needs, uh, a way to escape. And, of course, uh,

490
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Drinking is one way in the UK. A lot of people, uh,

491
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,500
And that's cultural, you know, and, and it's controlled. I would have to say,

492
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,500
But it is killing the nation. No doubt about it. It's a, I see it as an

493
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,500
Epidemic, uh, just because of the amount of consumption.

494
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,500
So that's one way or you could do what I do and spark up some of the

495
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Holy herb. But Anna, on an ongoing basis, I believe the general

496
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Populous needs escapism to basically survive and get through the day.

497
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
And, uh, a good way of that is looking at someone else's

498
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Aguiness. And, you know, if, um, if we weren't buying the newspapers for what

499
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,500
They put on the front page, or if we weren't watching the, um,

500
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,500
The gossip shows, uh, on television. And if we, you know, I mean, and it's

501
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Not even gossip shows. I mean, Britney Spears, that's mainstream news

502
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Now, that, that hits the top of the hour. You know, and then you have

503
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Today, there was a story about, uh, you know, the baby that was

504
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Dropped off of the six floor, uh, from a burning building and survived.

505
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,500
And all beautiful stories, but it's really just drugs. It's just, uh,

506
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,500
A quick drug shot to know that someone else's life is

507
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,500
Worse off than ours, and it just makes us feel good. And I think we should

508
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Try and experiment. Every single time you see a, a news report,

509
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Whether it's in the paper, whether you hit on the radio,

510
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,500
But it's an official news thing, right? Ask yourself

511
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Could this be

512
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Hundreds of thousands of other people that have this problem?

513
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,500
So, uh, let's take a Britney Spears as an example.

514
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,500
You know, she's freaking out. She may be bipolar.

515
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Um, you know, she's had a, a bad marriage.

516
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Um, she's turned to possibly to drugs.

517
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,500
And lesbianism. Okay. It's not all bad.

518
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Um, but are these problems that

519
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of people have?

520
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Yes, absolutely. So why are we highlighting just this one?

521
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,500
So unless it's someone who is coming from a group of people who have a problem

522
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,500
And they're being interviewed or highlighted as a representative,

523
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Then it's just bullshit and it's drugs for your brain.

524
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Chewing gum for your brain. Maybe that's a better way of looking at it.

525
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
So, let me see, what could we use?

526
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Same thing with the, with Heather McCartney and Sir Paul, you know,

527
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Bad divorcees? Yeah, this whole country is filled with them.

528
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,500
But the only one they highlight is that is, is the rich people.

529
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
So you need to ignore that.

530
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,500
You really need to. And usually it comes before the real news.

531
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:15,500
So if we, um, Madeline McCartney, you know, this is a, a sadly a girl who was abducted or maybe murdered.

532
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,500
And you know, it's you certainly, uh, they can't find her.

533
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Let's put it that way.

534
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
But is it only one child that this happens to?

535
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Or is it hundreds and thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of children?

536
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,500
So they're not reporting this based upon an epidemic of missing children.

537
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,500
They're reporting it based upon just one instance that will make you feel good.

538
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
That it's not your kid.

539
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Or feel some form of compassion.

540
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,500
The drugs, it's not even chewing gum. It is literally drugs.

541
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,500
So whenever you see that, you've got to shut your brain off to it.

542
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,500
You really do.

543
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
You can open it up once in a while.

544
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
But it's like any other drug.

545
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
You can't be drinking the whole day.

546
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
You can't be smoking dope all day long.

547
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
You can't be shooting up heroin.

548
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,500
You can't be taking MDMA or ecstasy all day.

549
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,500
You know, all of these things are probably okay one way.

550
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,500
The other as long as you know how to keep yourself in check.

551
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,500
And obviously I'm not trying to condone any form of illegal drug use.

552
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,500
No, do I have any experience with anything other than cigarettes, coffee,

553
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,500
So the nicotine, caffeine, and marijuana.

554
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,500
But you really got to train yourself.

555
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
You really do.

556
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Don't go down the rabbit hole.

557
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,500
If you see that happening, just stop and just say, okay, just realize it's drugs.

558
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
And you can look at the drugs.

559
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
You can sniff the drugs.

560
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
But I'm not going to take any drugs right now.

561
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Does that make any sense?

562
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Let's try that for a while.

563
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Because I guarantee you're going to be a lot happier.

564
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
And then loan behold.

565
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Because I've been trying this.

566
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,500
You're going to start to notice some of the beautiful things about the world around you.

567
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Like great weather instead of another bad day.

568
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Or it's not quite as bad as yesterday.

569
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
It will change your life.

570
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,500
I promise you.

571
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
I could go there for my chest.

572
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Hey, another salon for you.

573
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Comic strip.

574
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Comic strip.

575
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
Comic strip.

576
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Comic strip.

577
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Yo.

578
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Hiya.

579
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
Heyya.

580
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Adam and Madame Kerry.

581
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Yo.

582
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Here is CSV or EO correspondence.

583
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
So we're getting hostile.

584
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
We take over of Yahoo by Microsoft.

585
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Yo will not reject it because it is Google.

586
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,500
It has huge majority of such market as you know.

587
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
Okay, wait a minute.

588
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,500
This is CSV talking about the proposed Microsoft purchase of Yahoo.

589
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,500
And he says that the European Union will not block that type of acquisition.

590
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Because they're afraid of Google.

591
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Okay, just a short translation there.

592
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
CSV.

593
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Regarding Amaro.

594
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
The talks between Canada and EO.

595
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,500
To form a common free trade zone have just started.

596
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:59,500
Anyway, it will repeat if you yourself and you would have to leave EO

597
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,500
due to double taxation in you.

598
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Oh, okay.

599
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
A lot of things in one CSV.

600
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,500
First of all, I'm not saying that I'd leave anywhere for any reason whatsoever

601
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
because it's just money.

602
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
All right.

603
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,500
If I want to live somewhere and where I want to live is expensive,

604
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
I may choose to do that.

605
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
And it's all relative.

606
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
It's all just fucking numbers.

607
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,500
Really is.

608
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Nothing big.

609
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
In UK.

610
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:29,500
And the next EO correspondents from myself coming to you from Barcelona.

611
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
Cool.

612
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Yeah.

613
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,500
The mobile stuff.

614
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
Cool.

615
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Nice credo.

616
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
You have Adam.

617
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Yo.

618
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Thank you.

619
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Yeah, definitely check in from Barcelona CSB.

620
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Let us know what the latest and greatest is.

621
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Of course you know, I'm not going.

622
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
I got no time for that.

623
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
I got to go into the city today.

624
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
I do.

625
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
I told you I had that one one cancellation.

626
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
And then tomorrow again.

627
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,500
And then Friday, I believe I'm home.

628
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
And I got so much.

629
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
I have to take the car.

630
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,500
So this like Patricia's car is.

631
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,500
I think it's after if it's two or three years old,

632
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,500
and you have to get an MOT.

633
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Before you can get a tax disc.

634
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
They really make it jump through.

635
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
So it's got to be approved, I guess,

636
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
that it's sound and this roadward.

637
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,500
And then you have to pay the the tax.

638
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
And of course, I also just paid the insurers.

639
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

640
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
I'm doing it.

641
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Hey, you know what?

642
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
I'm really happy that we have a car to drive in.

643
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
Because we could be walking in the rain.

644
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
See, I found the positive side.

645
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,500
Hey, Adam.

646
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Bill from Virginia.

647
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
It was in the DST 1718.

648
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,500
And the guy who called in about the moisture sensor in the iPhone.

649
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Yeah, that was good.

650
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
That was just yesterday.

651
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Apparently, if you look into the headphone jack of the.

652
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
I pod touch for the iPhone.

653
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
If it's been submerged in water,

654
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
the sensor actually turns a different color.

655
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,500
I couldn't really tell if it had changed color or not.

656
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
But it's certainly a cool urban legend,

657
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
which hopefully we'll solve now.

658
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,500
I can't speak specifically for the iPhone.

659
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,500
But I know that most cell phones do have this.

660
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,500
And usually it's in the battery compartment.

661
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Of course you can't take it out on the iPhone.

662
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
If you pull pop the battery off,

663
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
a like an LG phones.

664
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,500
What I have is a little white circle or dot.

665
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
What do you want to call it?

666
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,500
And if it gets wet, it either turns dark or pink or something like this.

667
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
I know this because I had a buddy of mine who.

668
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
It's a similar thing.

669
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
Drops is in the toilet or whatever.

670
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
And I just brought it out for a week or two.

671
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,500
And it's tempted to take it back to Verizon.

672
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
And then they immediately.

673
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
�ing on it into that net.

674
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
It's been wet.

675
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Your warranty is always.

676
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
So I would start feeling a little bit.

677
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,500
There is a sensor that the cell phone people use.

678
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
Whether it's on iPhone or not.

679
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,500
I can't say, but I bet there's something somewhere.

680
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
And they're going to indicate it has been wet.

681
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Dr. Later.

682
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
All right, man.

683
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
Not quite the sign off.

684
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
We agreed upon.

685
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
But.

686
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,500
So I just opened up the Nokia E61I.

687
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,500
And I have to say there is a little white patch in there.

688
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
That that could be a sensor.

689
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,500
Let me see if I lick it.

690
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,500
Would it turn color?

691
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Hold on.

692
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
I'll really lick it for you.

693
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Okay.

694
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
I'm licking the E61I.

695
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Doesn't seem to be changing color.

696
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,500
Well, maybe a little bit.

697
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
I'll let it sit.

698
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
I'll let some, I'll let the saliva sit there.

699
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
And now we'll see.

700
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
That disgusting is that.

701
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
I'm sure the candy man could answer that for.

702
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
So we could get us the answer.

703
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Luke, what's going on with that, man?

704
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Is there a sensor?

705
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
I mean, it's, it's totally okay.

706
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
I mean, it's not like.

707
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
Some big secret.

708
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,500
I'm sure lots of people drop their phone in the toilet and take it back and say,

709
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
uh, don't work anymore.

710
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
That would be interesting.

711
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,500
Hey, we found him.

712
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
You know, those have been checking in.

713
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
Give me demographic information.

714
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
Oh, yes.

715
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Oh, yeah.

716
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
Once again, prove me wrong about who listens to this show.

717
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Hey, Adam.

718
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
This is Martin calling from Gator's Bird Merlin.

719
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,500
One time listener called a couple times before.

720
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
But not real recently.

721
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:06,500
Just listening to DSC 717 listening about the demographics part.

722
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,500
Haven't heard all the comments yet.

723
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,500
I've got about about 39 minutes into it.

724
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,500
But, uh, one to add my demographics, which I haven't heard.

725
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
So far African American male.

726
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
There he is, which is what I am.

727
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Uh, 40 years old.

728
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,500
Some right smack dab at middle age married.

729
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
Um, kids.

730
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Two kids in high school.

731
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,500
Hmm.

732
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
And, uh, what do I do?

733
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Uh, work for the federal government for now.

734
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,500
I'm doing, uh, kind of a, made upper level management stuff.

735
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
So basically I'm a bureaucrat.

736
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Uh, so.

737
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,500
All right.

738
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
Love you.

739
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,500
No harm.

740
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Uh, but I don't get here.

741
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,500
Although I have shaved my hair.

742
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
I guess I can still stay good here.

743
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,500
And, um, yeah, I can't remember all the rest of that crap.

744
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,500
You want us to say so, uh, peace run.

745
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Right on my brother.

746
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
I want a second.

747
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
I'm just, uh, changing something here.

748
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,500
I hope, uh, I'm wondering now.

749
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
I hope the sound is okay.

750
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,500
Uh, it might have been messed up up until now.

751
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
What?

752
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
How far we are into, are we into the show here?

753
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Uh, only 31 minutes.

754
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
Okay.

755
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
So if it sounds like crap for the past half hour.

756
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
I, uh, I really apologize.

757
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Hey, thanks man.

758
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,500
I really appreciate you calling in.

759
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
Great.

760
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,500
I love being proved wrong and, uh, and consistently, by the way.

761
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,500
But it is pretty clear.

762
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,500
It's still mainly men between 20 and 40 years old.

763
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
Haven't gotten a lot of calls under the 20.

764
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Uh, certainly many in late 40s, 50s.

765
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
But lots of 30s, lots of 20.

766
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
You know what?

767
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,500
We're all just chuck heads.

768
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Ain't that the truth?

769
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
Yeah.

770
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
Jesus.

771
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
With that, can I?

772
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Hi Adam, it's Matt from Gamesweasel.

773
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,500
On this week's show, we get your grips with the latest advanced wars game on the DS.

774
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Play an arcade shooter at home on the way in the form of Ghost Squad.

775
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,500
I give you fresh new details of Lara Croft's latest adventure in The Underworld.

776
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,500
And you can win one of three cool retro joystick junkies, T-shirts.

777
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,500
That's all at Gamesweasel.btpodshow.com.

778
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,500
You know, you're, if you're in the gaming, you really should check that show out.

779
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,500
It's been number one on iTunes in the gaming category a couple of times.

780
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
I think it's consistently top 10.

781
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,500
Gamesweasel.btpodshow.com.

782
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,500
Um, he does a video version, which is just really taken off.

783
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
And it's, and when you think about it, it's so simplistic.

784
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:29,500
You know, you just do the voiceover and then you cut videos on top of it of the games that he's talking about.

785
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
And it's really compelling to watch.

786
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
So keep an eye out for that.

787
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
Gamesweasel.btpodshow.com.

788
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,500
Let's call it the only wire cap for the Bush administration.

789
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,500
That's my administration.

790
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,500
This call might be only wire cap for the Bush administration.

791
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,500
That's my administration.

792
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,500
That's right Adam Curry.

793
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:00,500
This call in every other call that you make may be wire taps still.

794
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,500
Um, hey, Adam.

795
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,500
Keep an eye out.

796
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
They're looking at you.

797
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,500
They're watching it.

798
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,500
And then recording even our Skype conversations.

799
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
So Adam, I wanted to say hi.

800
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,500
You haven't called in a while.

801
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,500
It's been, uh, been playing a lot of great stuff.

802
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
As always on the DSC.

803
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Wanted to thank you for everything.

804
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
Keep it up.

805
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,500
And hopefully we will talk to you soon.

806
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Take care, Adam.

807
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,500
It's a big J from the two cents worth podcast and bald guy show out.

808
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Oh, AJ.

809
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,500
Uh, next time you might want to remove the microphone from the asshole.

810
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,500
That sounded pretty dusty, my friend.

811
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:48,500
And you did bring up a kind of a current point here in the United Kingdom.

812
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,500
Now, if you've never been here, or then if you're planning on coming over,

813
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,500
take a look around, particularly in the cities, but it's really everywhere.

814
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,500
This place is hung full of cameras.

815
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
You know, they call it CCTV.

816
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,500
In fact, it's amazing that I can even stand living here.

817
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Because people are being spied on continuously.

818
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,500
And this is huge controversy in parliament,

819
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:18,500
where a minister of parliament was essentially bugged while he was speaking to one of his constituents.

820
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,500
I believe he happened to be in jail, but still they were bugging him.

821
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,500
So they were wire tapping or ease dropping, et cetera.

822
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,500
And, you know, this is a big problem because, you know, now the ministers of parliament,

823
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,500
the MPs are saying, oh, you know, this is an outrage because we have to be able to speak and complete

824
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
to confidence with our constituents.

825
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:42,500
But the fact of the matter is this whole country is ease dropping on its citizens

826
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,500
to an unbelievable degree.

827
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,500
And it's so easy to get a wire tap.

828
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,500
In fact, someone from the council, a senior manager, can request a wire tap.

829
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
It's crazy.

830
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
And they're looking at you.

831
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,500
Big brother is everywhere with these cameras.

832
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,500
Now, of course, in a way, it's really, really good.

833
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,500
And Patricia's like, well, I think this is great because, you know,

834
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,500
if you're not doing the typical thing that she would say, and many people say,

835
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,500
well, if you're not doing anything wrong, what do you have to worry about?

836
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
And then I say to her, yeah, but you're going to wake up one day.

837
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,500
You're going to be living in an Arnold Schwarzenegger futuristic movie, where if you

838
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:26,500
Jay walk, you know, so already, if you go three miles an hour, two fast,

839
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,500
and the speed camera catches you, you have to go through all this hassle.

840
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,500
You have to send in your license.

841
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
They take off points.

842
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
Then they give you your license back after six weeks.

843
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,500
You have to pay it, you know, like the equivalent about a hundred or

844
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
hundred or hundred and twenty dollar fine.

845
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
You know, so what's next?

846
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,500
You Jay walked, you know, so you're going to have to think about every single

847
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,500
movie you make and you will be so incredibly restricted.

848
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
We will be living in a science fiction movie.

849
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
I don't even think we can stop this anymore.

850
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,500
I think we're just on the way to it.

851
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,500
They now have cameras that watch people and if they are,

852
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:06,500
if they are portraying anti-social behavior, then the cameras

853
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
are talking to people on the street.

854
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,500
Like, hey, shape up.

855
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Don't do that, boy.

856
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,500
I mean, you know, how we're not that far away from being in,

857
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,500
you know, one of these futuristic movies.

858
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,500
And I think the British people are just waking up to this.

859
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,500
I think they're now finally seeing that A, it doesn't stop the bad guys

860
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,500
because the terrorists were still able to blow up buses and tubes.

861
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,500
That will be subways to you and I.

862
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,500
You know, it just doesn't stop anything.

863
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,500
So it's essentially there to harass the citizens.

864
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,500
And, you know, they check you if you drive into the city with your car.

865
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,500
They can scan your license plate.

866
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
So you know, if you don't pay your congestion fee,

867
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,500
you don't have to write green gear,

868
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
I mean, all good initiatives,

869
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,500
but this is really fucking with people's heads.

870
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,500
It is just not, you know, it's, you watch.

871
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Pay attention to this.

872
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,500
Pay very close attention.

873
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
You'll see more and more stories about people

874
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,500
getting frustrated as they start to uncover and come to terms with the fact

875
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,500
that they are being tapped, ease dropped on,

876
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,500
and looked at 24 hours a day.

877
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,500
And of course, this is actually no different in the United States.

878
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:24,500
Out of Jason from San Diego, you're wondering what the letter is,

879
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,500
what the letter stands for that's on your customs forms.

880
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,500
You think it's an M, but it's not some decent deep down secret

881
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,500
information government has to us.

882
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,500
What that actually is is an upside down W,

883
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
but don't tell nobody.

884
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,500
It actually stands for Wanker.

885
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,500
Ah, yeah.

886
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
Somehow, I think not.

887
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,500
I got a really cute joke in from Carmen Tyler's mom,

888
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Susie Tyler.

889
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:01,500
And it's one you could, you could try on your spouse,

890
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,500
or your girlfriend, but you might not want to.

891
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
I've never heard this one.

892
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,500
I guess it's an old joke, but I'll just read it to you.

893
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,500
Fresh from the shower, I stand in front of the mirror,

894
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,500
complaining to my husband that my breasts are too small.

895
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,500
Instead of characteristically telling me,

896
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
it's not so honey.

897
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,500
He uncaracteristically comes up with a suggestion.

898
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,500
Honey, if you want your breasts to grow,

899
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,500
then every single day take a piece of toilet paper

900
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,500
and rub it between your breasts for a few seconds.

901
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Willing to try anything, I fetch a piece of toilet paper

902
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
and stand in front of the mirror,

903
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
rubbing it between my breasts.

904
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
How long will this take I asked?

905
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,500
They will grow larger over a period of years, my husband replies.

906
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
I stopped.

907
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
Do you really think that rubbing a piece of toilet paper

908
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,500
between my breasts every day will make my breast larger over the years?

909
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
Without missing a beat, he says,

910
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
well, it worked for your ass, didn't it?

911
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,500
I'm sorry.

912
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
I just thought that was kind of cute.

913
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Don't try this at home, guys.

914
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
It could result in death.

915
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
I came to this desert again from Belgium.

916
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,500
Please grab the last voice, Mel, if you heard it,

917
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,500
because it wasn't.

918
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,500
I did completely because I was listening to DC777

919
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,500
and it just got back to after punching in on the voice mail

920
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
some meat and bandwidth stuff.

921
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
Anyway, Jim, graphic quick.

922
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
The living in Belgium 30 years old,

923
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
or smacking a middle.

924
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
I'm Dutch.

925
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,500
I'm off Indian middle class.

926
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
That's about it, I guess.

927
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,500
And I hope to grow a bit more in what we're doing here.

928
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
I'm by the way, the aerial photo business,

929
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
which is cool.

930
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,500
That's cool.

931
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,500
That's fine.

932
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
And concerning me to bandwidth.

933
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Do you fly out of Antwerp?

934
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
You should let me know, dude.

935
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
That's pretty cool.

936
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
Meter bandwidth before he gets it launches into this.

937
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,500
This is a conversation we've had been having for a couple of weeks

938
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
here in the Charlie.

939
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,500
Where I believe that there is a chance that the whole idea

940
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,500
of changing the way bandwidth is priced into a meter,

941
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
a meter service,

942
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,500
might actually turn out to be cheaper for the majority of customers.

943
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:16,500
And of course, a lot more expensive for heavy, heavy users,

944
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,500
bit torrent, serving stuff up, peer to peer, et cetera.

945
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,500
And you know, I'm a firm believer that it should be priced

946
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,500
into some form of metered fashion because it's just the way it works.

947
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,500
It's the way it works on my end when I'm serving stuff up to you.

948
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,500
So it should probably work that way on your end.

949
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,500
That just makes sense to me.

950
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Because more traffic does mean at a certain point,

951
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,500
more customer service, representatives, more routers,

952
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,500
more backhaul, more transit costs, all kinds of things

953
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,500
that come into play.

954
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,500
And so I've asked you to find out how much you use on a typical month.

955
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
You know, including your movie downloads,

956
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
including your porn streaming stuff,

957
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,500
including your podcasts, all of that.

958
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,500
Let's see if our Belgian friend has some info for us.

959
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
The company, you might know in building,

960
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,500
they're called Telonette, doing vision IPS over the cable,

961
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,500
and they offer 20 megabits down,

962
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,500
and just under a megabits up.

963
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,500
A certain month, for 60 euros,

964
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,500
and you get 30 gigabytes per month on that.

965
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,500
If you want to add to that,

966
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,500
you're paying a euro per megabits,

967
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
including tax.

968
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,500
Yes, that would add to your,

969
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,500
I mean, Japanese call it coming in to US

970
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,500
and Europe to get an idea of what's going on in the world.

971
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,500
All right, man.

972
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,500
I love you.

973
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
I'm great here.

974
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,500
I hope you win and all that rest.

975
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,500
Oh, yes.

976
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,500
All right, dude, thank you.

977
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
Now I appreciate it.

978
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,500
And so that means you probably do about about 30 gigs a month.

979
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,500
Sounds like it may be heavier on weekends,

980
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,500
but you would fit right in that 60 euro bracket,

981
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
and then you pay an extra euro on top of it,

982
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
which is pricey, per gigabit,

983
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,500
because it's probably 10,

984
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,500
about 15 to 20 times more than you'd have to pay.

985
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,500
And again, I don't like the overage.

986
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,500
It just doesn't sit well with me.

987
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,500
I'd rather that, you know, that you just paid.

988
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,500
It sounds like if you're doing 30 gigs

989
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,500
and it's costing you 60 euros

990
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,500
that it's about two euros per gig transferred.

991
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
So that's pricey.

992
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,500
But then again, you see when you go higher,

993
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,500
the price gets cheaper.

994
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,500
And this to me is very interesting.

995
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
So once you go over your lot of bandwidth,

996
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
you can buy more,

997
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,500
but the price is a little bit cheaper than your standard package.

998
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
Interesting.

999
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,500
I'm telling you, I feel I just might come out on the right end of this.

1000
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,500
We'll have to see.

1001
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,500
I appreciate the call, my friend.

1002
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,500
Yo.

1003
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,500
Say you had them.

1004
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
Yeah.

1005
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,500
Zero from Ashville, North Carolina.

1006
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,500
And that was up.

1007
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
We don't have any black and rather the wild.

1008
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,500
How about a little that black lab,

1009
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,500
maybe feed us so in that acoustic version that just.

1010
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,500
Oh, good point.

1011
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,500
I love the motion.

1012
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,500
I'd love to hear that on the DSG.

1013
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,500
Yeah.

1014
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,500
And heard those guys in a while and they didn't go in.

1015
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,500
All right, man.

1016
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,500
I'm going to play something else for you, though.

1017
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,500
One of my favorites.

1018
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,500
Lonely boy.

1019
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
It's black lab.

1020
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,500
On the Charlie.

1021
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:38,500
You say you like sleep alone and I say,

1022
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:44,500
I miss the way you believe you say,

1023
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,500
I get away with money.

1024
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:54,500
You know I've paid for it, and someone I can't leave me.

1025
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:02,500
Do you feel something when you back in the sea?

1026
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,500
Something you want to see again?

1027
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,500
I could be the one.

1028
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,500
I could make it up to you.

1029
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Say goodbye.

1030
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:21,500
I'm the lonely boy.

1031
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:31,500
I love you.

1032
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,500
You say,

1033
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:40,500
I broken heart because we are safe.

1034
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,500
I sell it cheap to you.

1035
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,500
You say,

1036
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,500
I miss you.

1037
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,500
I fall alive after holding it.

1038
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:56,500
10 dollar bills and smoke and money doesn't burn so clean.

1039
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:04,500
Do you feel something when you back in the sea?

1040
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:09,500
Something you want to see again?

1041
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,500
I could be the one.

1042
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,500
I could make it up to you.

1043
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,500
Say goodbye.

1044
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:22,500
