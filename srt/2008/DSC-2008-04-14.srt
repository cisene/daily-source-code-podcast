1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
You're out of my thinking making this money thing a little too complicated I think we need

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,880
to explain it a little easier so I'm gonna say like this let's pretend that there's a

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,520
neighborhood and see the neighborhood has a bank it's called the bank of Louis people

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,920
come to Louis when they need money Louis lens a money people pay Louis back with a little

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,880
extra for I interest people don't pay Louis people getting broken legs see it's

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,680
pretty simple don't understand it's on the DSC 746 let's try to keep it simple

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,680
compete I knew you were a good guy there and I'm carried this is the daily source code

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,680
the daily source code

9
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,880
$16 billion worth of airplane strapped my ass in the next generation radio content in my

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,680
years I like to think I'm flying to the street

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:18,200
I've been telling me what it means and it's coming to an end

12
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:25,980

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,220
from back in the day when they called us swinging

18
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,940
different word for making love, right?

19
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,940
Of course, it's only 30 years old.

20
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,260
Now they're entering to the soundtrack of our lives.

21
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,660
Jim Gilstrap, not to be confused with...

22
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,300
Gil-Jockstrap.

23
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,300
I don't know.

24
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,500
Everybody, how you doing?

25
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,860
Welcome to the Daily Source Code episode number 746 coming to you

26
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,300
from the curry manner in a very wet Gilford.

27
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,380
It's coming down way a little bit of hail earlier on.

28
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,900
It does not look like it's gonna be a very nice week.

29
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,900
We just got more of this April showers,

30
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,820
which are supposed to bring me flowers.

31
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,220
And I'm late today, it's already 10 past three in the afternoon.

32
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,340
I spent an entire morning getting car insurance for Christina's car.

33
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,540
You know, I got Shanghai the other weekend.

34
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,420
And of course, you'll have her license any day now.

35
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,100
All things going according to plan.

36
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,420
And well, so I had to go figure that out.

37
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,860
And got her a Renault Twingo, which is a really cute car.

38
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,860
It's a great, you know, first car.

39
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,500
It's reasonably sturdy, I'd say.

40
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,060
It's safe.

41
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,300
And I don't want to have any hassle, so it's new.

42
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,060
And very interesting, though, trying to get insurance.

43
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,540
Just even to put it on my name.

44
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,700
Because I learned very quickly as I spoke with our regular insurer,

45
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,780
Jaguar, which I think is forward insurance.

46
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,180
It's a forward anyway, right?

47
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,020
I said, well, you know, so I'll get this car now.

48
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,180
And then when my daughter gets her license,

49
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,380
I want to add her as a named driver, as they call it over here.

50
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,900
Ah, yeah, hold on a second.

51
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,660
She came back, she gave me a quote of 4,000 pounds.

52
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,500
What are you talking about?

53
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,140
The car only is a little bit more than that.

54
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,820
She's like, no, well, you know, we don't like ensuring anyone under 25.

55
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,860
Like, what the hell is this?

56
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,020
She said, well, it's the global credit crisis.

57
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,780
We have to be really careful.

58
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,580
Say, well, I have two cars insured with you already.

59
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,380
Combined, they're not even a quarter of that.

60
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,900
No, it's all about adding that third.

61
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,020
I said, all right, thank you very much.

62
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,700
Goodbye.

63
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,580
So I called up the dealer.

64
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,420
I said, you know, dude, here's the situation.

65
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,820
He said, you know what, why don't you just get it on your name?

66
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,300
And then add your daughter later, because it's a hassle

67
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,820
explaining she doesn't have her license yet,

68
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,940
and she only has a provisionals.

69
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,460
And okay, no problem.

70
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,700
And I call up the Renault insurance, right?

71
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,380
Renault itself.

72
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,460
Like that should be okay.

73
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,660
That's why I got the Jaguar insurance for the Jag.

74
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,300
So I call up, we go through everything, and you know,

75
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,540
she asked me all the, all my details.

76
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,700
And she says, what do I, are you employed?

77
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,980
I said, yeah, so what do you do?

78
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,100
So I'm managing director, which is kind of what I am over here

79
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,260
for BT Pod Show.

80
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,860
What's the name of the company, BT Pod Show?

81
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,700
What is it?

82
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,940
Oh, it's internet, audio and video.

83
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,300
We do television production.

84
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,100
I tried to make a little more understandable for.

85
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,380
So media and entertainment, yep.

86
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,020
Okay, hold on one second.

87
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,260
She comes back.

88
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,860
And she says, I'm sorry.

89
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,300
You've been declined because of your job.

90
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,660
You mean, said, well, we find that that sector of business

91
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,940
too risky to ensure what the hell is that?

92
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,340
I was dumbfounded, I don't even know what to say.

93
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,420
This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

94
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,780
So then I think, you know, why don't I go to confused.com,

95
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,100
which is what I see advertised all the time on television.

96
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,780
There you go, there's advertising working, TV advertising.

97
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,980
And I had no idea what confused.com was, but obviously,

98
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,700
you can get different quotes from different insurers.

99
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,980
So I start feeling this all these forms out.

100
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,220
There's a lot of them.

101
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,420
And I get to the very end.

102
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,900
And it says, okay, we want a username password, okay.

103
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,620
And then it says, you have to do a reminder.

104
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,980
So always, for the type of stuff, I have a password

105
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,220
and I know what the reminder is going to be.

106
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,500
And then those interesting line that caught my eye that said,

107
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,100
some sites that we'll be registering you with require

108
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,980
your mother's maiden name, I'm like, wait a minute.

109
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,820
These guys are going to go out and they're going to,

110
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,580
I guess, automatically, or they're probably

111
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,220
tied in three APIs or whatever, I'm going to give all

112
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,740
of this information, I just filled out.

113
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,220
Oh, this entire huge, oh, my life is in is what I just gave them.

114
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,180
I'm going to give that to hundreds of insurers.

115
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,220
I don't think so.

116
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,380
So cancel, got out of that.

117
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,540
Hopefully the stuff they captured before I submitted,

118
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,460
going from screen to screen has been destroyed.

119
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,060
But wow, what a scam that is.

120
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,020
No wonder those guys have enough money to buy

121
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,580
television commercial airtime.

122
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,940
If you're calling that much information,

123
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,460
that's a very valuable list.

124
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,300
Thank you very much.

125
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,020
Don't want to be that much on the grid.

126
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,940
I'm out of that.

127
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,100
Voting you guys off.

128
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,740
And so I call the detail back, says, you know,

129
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,780
I just tried test codes.

130
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,460
They're the biggest, that's easiest.

131
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,860
And so, you know, worked, I didn't say I was in media.

132
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,220
Although I was being truthful, I said,

133
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,060
well, you know, we're kind of in telecoms.

134
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,780
It's BT Podjo.

135
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,340
So there was no question about the occupation there,

136
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,100
but man, what a big pain in the ass.

137
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,100
And still the quote was reasonably high

138
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,020
because we have our international driver's licenses.

139
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,900
And in this case, Tesco or whatever they represent,

140
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,860
they will count that as just a zero experience driver,

141
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,340
even though I've been driving for over 25 years.

142
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,940
So the quote was still high.

143
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,980
But, you know, like 300 pounds.

144
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,140
But that's still a rageously high for a car

145
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,100
that has a 1.2 liter engine.

146
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,420
I mean, just, God.

147
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,060
Oh, anyway, those are just my temporary problems.

148
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,060
Not the problems of the world

149
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,060
because that's where we're here to solve my friends, right?

150
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,020
Well, let's start in, let's see,

151
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,820
why don't we move on down to Florida.

152
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,020
We've got Dan, our ex-pat from New York.

153
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,100
And, you know, this is a voice of Dan,

154
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,860
expat New Yorker here in Fort Lauderdale.

155
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,700
I don't know.

156
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,540
Oh, yeah.

157
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,940
I'm just wondering, fly boy,

158
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,540
already today's commercial airline is designed to operate

159
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,380
in an environment where oil is $100 a barrel.

160
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,540
And, are these FAA inspections and the grounding of flights

161
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,100
just to excuse perhaps to cover up

162
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,100
because of the whole agenda, the hidden agenda

163
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,100
of decreasing the lifestyle, the standard of living

164
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,100
of the US, a read-down and sing of little wide wealth

165
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,300
as a world directed by the powers that be dictated

166
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,900
by the Bush training regime.

167
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,900
Yeah.

168
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,500
I've been receiving these about.

169
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,460
No kidding.

170
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,180
Anyway, my two cents, have a good one.

171
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,100
No, thanks.

172
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,780
Alright.

173
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,380
Dan, expat New Yorker and Florida.

174
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,220
Yeah, I talked about this over the weekend with John C.

175
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,660
to Vorac on Noah Gendell, briefly.

176
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,660
Well, let me just try and address your question

177
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,900
so the people who listen to both shows

178
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,420
will get some new information.

179
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,900
You know, civil aviation started off

180
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,380
being subsidized by the male.

181
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,380
Okay, you remember that the first transatlantic flights

182
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,100
these planes were bringing male and it was air male.

183
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,220
And that was a really big deal

184
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,700
because now we had a really fast way to send letters

185
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,660
and packages, et cetera.

186
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,060
And so these flights were already pretty much paid for.

187
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,220
Let's just call it subsidized by the postal system.

188
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,700
Postal systems worldwide.

189
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,820
Many of them, which, of course, were government

190
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
controlled and owned, which most of them still are.

191
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,660
Although there are lots of alternatives

192
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,380
to the male system to the postal systems now.

193
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,180
And so in addition to male, they started to add on passengers.

194
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,980
But over the years, the actual male carriage,

195
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,580
you know, that whole business has been broken open.

196
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,820
We've got careers, we've got all kinds of alternatives.

197
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,940
And of course, aviation has, you know,

198
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,900
there's just so much more possibilities.

199
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,460
So we have, you know, the capabilities are so much more vast

200
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,740
that I would be surprised if if there's any U.S.

201
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,620
and of course government contracts are great, right?

202
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,780
They are always the best.

203
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,260
They're not necessary.

204
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,340
The sharpest market driven prices.

205
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
I would be surprised if there's any type of subsidy.

206
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,620
Probably not because, you know, these airlines

207
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,700
still trying to operate under,

208
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,740
you know, oh, man, it's such a tough issue.

209
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,620
You know, we need them, particularly in the United States.

210
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,780
And in Europe now too, we cannot live, you know,

211
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,620
business cannot take place without all of these reasonably

212
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,940
priced flights going all over the place.

213
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,780
And the only way they're going to be reasonably priced

214
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,460
is if they stay reasonably priced, you know,

215
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,060
so no, the airlines were absolutely not set up this,

216
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,380
and it's a spreadsheet business.

217
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,580
I've owned an airline.

218
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,660
An Air Operator Certificate, a very small airline

219
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,860
with only two helicopters, but I certainly know how it works.

220
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,820
And it's complete spreadsheet business.

221
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,660
You know exactly what is going to cost you per hour?

222
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,940
You know, your crew costs are the variables

223
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,820
are, of course, oil, which and fuel.

224
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,860
So a derivative, of course, of oil.

225
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,420
And yeah, that's outrageous.

226
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,700
And I believe that we are paying more,

227
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,740
but probably these airlines have been, you know,

228
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,620
cutting it really, really close for a long time.

229
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,700
Competition is not made it very easy in this regard.

230
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,860
And some would say maybe we should regulate again.

231
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,980
I don't know, man, but airlines sure are sucking.

232
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,260
Of course, we got the FAA's pulling their spot

233
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,300
in inspection, grounding entire fleets of aircraft.

234
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,700
Now, that's a whole separate issue.

235
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,780
That's between the FAA inspectors or the FAA, really.

236
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,100
And the government, they've got to get their act together.

237
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,620
They've got to open up a little closer dialogue.

238
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,540
Because, you know, those types of inspections,

239
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,500
that type of work, it should just be built in.

240
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,900
You know, if they're already skimping on that,

241
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,540
then, of course, they're bankrupt.

242
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,660
If they're not already going bankrupt,

243
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,300
then we've got British airways.

244
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,660
Oh, man, what a mess.

245
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,740
Terminal five is, you know, they don't expect

246
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,140
to even bring over the rest of their long haul flights

247
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,000
until June messing up everything over

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,200
to terminals one through four at Heathrow.

249
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
No, it's an absolute mess.

250
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,640
And I think what's happening now in the US

251
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,120
is probably the only right thing to happen is,

252
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,880
you know, you've got to have carriers going out of business.

253
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,960
But of course, the existing carriers have to have

254
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,520
a business model that will take them, you know,

255
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,080
into those new markets that can help them expand.

256
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,880
And I just don't think they have it.

257
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,040
And, you know, we're going to be paying a lot more

258
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,840
if we want this convenience of flying.

259
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,280
I just don't see any other way.

260
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,760
It's either that or we go to a, you know,

261
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,400
government sponsorship or subsidies.

262
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,720
It's probably, when you think about it economically,

263
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,360
it's probably a great time to get into the airline business.

264
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,200
Oh, hey, Vey.

265
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,800
Let's see, last time we spoke together here

266
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
on the Charlie, we were talking about the protest

267
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,080
in San Francisco, which took place last week,

268
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
people trying to douse the Olympic flame.

269
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,240
Of course, we had the pro, to bet protesters

270
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,080
and the pro Chinese, converging on the streets of San Francisco.

271
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,440
And I guess, you know, there was something else,

272
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,640
what I read today.

273
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,040
Oh, my point on Friday, at least, was that, you know,

274
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,480
we're so gung-ho to take up someone else's issue.

275
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,400
Also really important, but look at all the things

276
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,520
we have at home, you know, we're at war,

277
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,160
we're in economic crisis, you know,

278
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,640
where our family units are in crisis.

279
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,080
There's all kinds of stuff that certainly could be improved.

280
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,200
And, you know, by the way, I don't want to be a downer.

281
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,760
I mean, it's not like it's all that bad, but still.

282
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,360
It seems like there's a lot of stuff we could be working on

283
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,800
at home, and we're just not doing any of it.

284
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,920
You know, how long have I been calling for people

285
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,800
to protest the government here in the UK?

286
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,760
Can't get anyone to move yet.

287
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,600
It seems that it was very easy for a whole bunch of people

288
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,040
to create a flash mob and do a Rick roll

289
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,240
with Liverpool Street Station the other week.

290
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,800
I'll put a link in the show notes to that BBC news item

291
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,640
about that.

292
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,440
I mean, that's not just, that drives me nuts.

293
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,600
It's like, oh, we can all do a Rick roll,

294
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,160
which is fantastic, and it made the news.

295
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
It's on YouTube.

296
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,960
This is exactly the type of thing you want,

297
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,600
but there's no payoff, it's dumb, there's no payload.

298
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,920
So how can we take the concept of getting everyone

299
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,360
to do a Rick roll, and then put some payload in there,

300
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,760
like, hey, you know, by the way, Gordon Brown,

301
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,160
or whoever you want to protest against, oh, man,

302
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,640
we need to, where's Abby Hoffman?

303
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,200
He's dead, isn't he?

304
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,480
Crap, how we need to do the new steal this book

305
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,960
when we need to help people to explain

306
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,280
how we can really get some good protesting.

307
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,840
I got to think about it too.

308
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,520
It just drives me mad.

309
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,960
It drives me absolutely mad.

310
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,720
Now, apparently in San Francisco,

311
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,640
this is protesting for things other than what's going on

312
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,520
in San Francisco or in the rest of the world

313
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,120
seems to be pretty much the norm.

314
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,520
I had, and this is San from Palo Alto.

315
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:11,000
So you were talking about the protests

316
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,600
you were seeing over the Olympic flame in San Francisco.

317
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,800
So what's interesting about that, you know,

318
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,400
you were upset that they were protesting over something

319
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,200
like Olympic torture, the Olympics instead

320
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,800
of something that is really important.

321
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,080
Well, you have to understand is that that's San Francisco.

322
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,240
San Francisco likes to protest over anything.

323
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,640
They protest over, and one of the reasons

324
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,800
why I don't read this San Francisco Chronicle

325
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,200
is they love protesting and complaining over every little

326
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,320
minutiae you could imagine.

327
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,080
And for the most part, no one listens to it at all.

328
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,880
Anywhere in the world except for other people in San Francisco.

329
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,000
So I agree that Sergio is really great

330
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,640
and they should be protesting over things that are closer

331
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,600
to home and matter a lot more about.

332
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,280
But they never done it before.

333
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,560
So maybe they did it in the 60s, but they haven't

334
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,360
in the last 20 years, and certainly not since I lived here.

335
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:20,120
Anyways, good luck, great hair, whatever, I'll be with you

336
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,960
and bye.

337
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,440
Yeah.

338
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,400
I, that's funny because I did hear a couple other people

339
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
mentioned that to me.

340
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,680
So that's San Francisco, man.

341
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,320
That's not typical any town USA.

342
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,720
Maybe it just has to get a lot worse before people will

343
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,520
wake up to it, maybe that's what it is.

344
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,040
Maybe we really have to really, I mean, I can see this

345
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,720
coming to a head, this global financial crisis is not just

346
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,160
something on the news, okay?

347
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,920
It's not, look, it's even affecting me.

348
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,560
I, people don't want to give me insurance because they can't

349
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,680
take any risk anymore.

350
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,360
They have to have low risk.

351
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,480
And so they're tightening up everything.

352
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,160
You know, that's why I get a 4,000 pound quote on a 6,000 pound

353
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
car.

354
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,120
It's just outrageous.

355
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,080
So maybe it has to really come down to it.

356
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,440
It has to really come down to a crunch where all really

357
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
pissed off.

358
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,120
The world bank, it's it today, I think, called, that there's

359
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,040
a worldwide crisis with the food.

360
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,200
And they handed out $10 million, where was it?

361
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,480
I had to hear the handed out $10 million to a Haiti, I

362
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,840
think.

363
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,440
Let me see, I'll just bring up this news article because I've

364
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,720
found that fascinating that how can we still have famine

365
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,080
in the world?

366
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,400
Can that just drive you nuts?

367
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,320
Crap, okay, this link broke.

368
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,000
But I saved it, too.

369
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,960
Now, well, anyways, the, the point is the world bank is calling

370
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,000
for immediate action on deepening global food crisis.

371
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,280
And that's mainly because of the cost of stuff like

372
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,680
rice and wheat.

373
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,480
You watch, and it's going to start affecting YouTube.

374
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,040
Start counting your money at the end of the month.

375
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,520
And when everyone's ready to party and get down and yell and

376
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,760
make some noise, I'll be here.

377
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,920
You know, people in other countries know exactly what to do.

378
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,240
And they know exactly what kind of feeling you have to have.

379
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,560
And they understand the vibe because they've been living in

380
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,960
less prolific circumstances as we have.

381
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,240
I am just shortly from conclude, Mexico.

382
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,320
A long time easier, I just go to tell you a few things about your

383
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,680
goodbyes.

384
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,520
The daily source code, you say, leave your guide with passion and

385
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,240
your freedom.

386
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,520
I think you need to change that.

387
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,240
Okay, so just, because I've already heard him say this all,

388
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,640
you know, he's from Mexico, he's talking real fast.

389
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,040
What he's saying is instead of your usual sign off, which is

390
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,600
live your life with passion and enjoy your freedom, you should try the

391
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,080
follow-up.

392
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,000
Now, for if you're led with passion and fight for your freedom or

393
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,200
demand your freedom or spend up for your freedom, something like that.

394
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,320
The way things are going, he's not looking to do it.

395
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,280
At the end of that, the thing I wanted to tell you is that the

396
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,600
future is on the third of the world countries.

397
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,200
Because our government, it's also spying on us, but they don't have

398
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,840
to turn out that technology or the money to do it a bit

399
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,600
right away.

400
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:15,440
And you can find the fear, cancun, male, 52 to kids.

401
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,840
Love you, no, almost great hair, hope you win, folder.

402
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,360
Darling, thank you.

403
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,160
Thanks to appreciate the folder coming too.

404
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,520
Yeah, so there's a very good point.

405
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,760
It's kind of like, it was a jenga.

406
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,800
Is that the name of the game where you pull those little blocks out and you put it

407
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,600
on top?

408
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,640
That's exactly what's happening.

409
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,120
The third world countries have a lot more, you know, they have growth,

410
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,240
everything's ahead of them.

411
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,680
And so, you know, you pull one of those third world country blocks out and you put it on

412
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,400
top, guess what's happening, to happen is that new us, so

413
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,040
called at the top of the, at the top of the chain, you're going to start

414
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,400
moving down.

415
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,760
And that's okay.

416
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,920
But I think we could equal it out a little bit more.

417
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,960
Oh, it's going to be really interesting to be in the minority living in

418
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,400
underdeveloped country.

419
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,560
I've always wondered what that's going to be like.

420
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,760
We're all going to find out.

421
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:09,520
I had a bit of a map from Game's Weasel coming up on this show.

422
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,920
We have a review of Rainbow Six Vegas 2.

423
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,800
Metal Gear Solid portable opt platform, the PSP.

424
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,200
I'll show you how to fix the next box 360,

425
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,600
sort of, and you can win copies of Viking, battle pass guard on the 360 as well.

426
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,280
That's all against Weasel.com.

427
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,160
Games Weasel and also games Weasel TV,

428
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
and check it out for sure if you want to know what's going on.

429
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,040
Particularly in the UK, I think we're working on a U.S. version of that as well,

430
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,920
with U.S. release dates that the show is really, really kicking.

431
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,680
So I did want to mention that even though I had a hard time here,

432
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,120
comes, you can feel it.

433
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,720
Even though I had a really hard time getting my, my car insurance,

434
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,080
life insurance on the other hand, which at the rate I'm going,

435
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,120
I'll need some, that's really easy.

436
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,880
In fact, I can get 70% off on life insurance.

437
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,960
And so can you, if you use my code at Acute Quote.

438
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,600
So if you don't have life insurance, go get informed, okay?

439
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
And by the way, no one's called in about this.

440
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,720
So either you're all buying it, or you're not investigating,

441
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,920
you're not even thinking about it.

442
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,400
And I think it particularly, if you're the median age of the charted listener,

443
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,560
you might want to have a quick look at what life insurance really means,

444
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,000
and what it can do for you.

445
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,240
And particularly for the beneficiaries, because of course,

446
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,160
it'll do nothing for you once you're dead.

447
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,480
I love selling life insurance.

448
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,880
Go to Acute Quote.com slash dsc online.

449
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,200
The dog's going to need some life insurance, if you didn't shut up,

450
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
or, and this is kind of cool, we set up a custom phone number

451
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,160
for you to call.

452
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:42,000
It's 1-800-410-7214, obviously, for US residents only,

453
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,880
Acute Quote.com.

454
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,160
I want to come back to the China Tibet thing, but first,

455
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,960
and I'm thinking about this throughout the entire prep session

456
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,240
in the morning this morning, because it really is only for Wednesday,

457
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,640
that I'm supposed to be playing this call, but I'm pretty sure

458
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,480
that I'm not going to be able to do a show Wednesday,

459
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,000
and I'm very worried that the person who this call is intended for

460
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,200
may not hear this show until Wednesday.

461
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,240
So I decided to play it now, so it may come through a day early,

462
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,880
but it's such a beautiful thing that I wanted to make sure that it got through.

463
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,720
Hello, my name's Susan, and I'm the second Dutch vice

464
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,520
of Dutch sales guy, you please, and Germany.

465
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,400
Okay, so this is Susan.

466
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,960
I love this, the pregnant wife.

467
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,440
I love the way she loves it, the official pregnant wife,

468
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,720
of sales guy, you, who lives in Germany.

469
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,600
I'll just listen to your voice, Susan.

470
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,200
I think we need some naked pregnant pictures,

471
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
and she's calling in.

472
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,280
I was surprised when I heard this, but it's really nice.

473
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,960
I think it would be some noise, but I'm not sure if these kind of messages

474
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,680
didn't hear a show, but I thought I'd give it a try.

475
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,880
This coming Wednesday, April 16, is my husband's 31st birthday,

476
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,920
and because he's a big son of your show, I thought it would be a great surprise if I would appear on it.

477
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,560
Then I would like to say to him, Lisa, I can't even ask that.

478
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,720
He's dead, much A&F to be at it, and that's for all the way from a Sudan

479
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,200
and this one or last, I was right away to this.

480
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,200
You have it to best, and that's also not to really sound about you.

481
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,120
Bigger this way, I know this is a bit of a lost minutes request,

482
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,600
but I hope you might be able to squeeze this into your show on Wednesday.

483
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,560
Thank you, Adam.

484
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,440
Nah, Susan, that is so incredibly sweet.

485
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,040
You know, hey, guys, does your wife do that for you?

486
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,120
You know, she went through the trouble of figuring out what this guy is talking about,

487
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
because of course you're saying, oh, is this into the Charlie,

488
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,200
this, the Charlie, that, she's probably at home while I'm out.

489
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,040
The podcast, I don't give a shit.

490
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,000
What is he talking about?

491
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,840
And so she takes the time to listen to the show.

492
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,480
She gets the phone numbers from the show, no, she calls in.

493
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,200
She's already, you know, she understands kind of the format of the show,

494
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,800
so she's listened to it, and she says the most beautiful thing to him.

495
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,200
She's even thanking him for all the things she's done.

496
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,400
He's done for her over the years on his birthday, which is Wednesday.

497
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,880
I'd say, you, you are in for a big ass, lay my friend, congratulations,

498
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,560
and happy birthday for all your chucklehead friends here at the Daily Source Code.

499
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,960
Here's a song for you to love birds to get into the mood together from Crystal Gale.

500
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:55,840
When you go, I'll describe all that long, say that it's all true,

501
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:07,600
and don't it make my bad eyes tell me no secrets tell me some lies,

502
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:18,480
give me no reason to give me out of the box tell me love and don't let me cry.

503
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:29,520
Say anything, but don't say goodbye, I've been meaning to treat you bad,

504
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:38,080
you know, just what I have, but I'm in now,

505
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:50,400
and don't take my brown eyes, don't make my brown eyes, don't make my brown eyes,

506
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:13,600
don't it make my brown eyes, don't it make my brown eyes, don't it make my brown eyes,

507
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:29,680
Don't it make my brown eyes, don't it make my brown eyes

508
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:39,680
This is a daily source code

509
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,680
On December 1, 2007, the portal opened.

510
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,680
Hell's Army came forth.

511
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,680
The demon said on world domination.

512
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,680
No one is safe.

513
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,680
No one is free from the wrath of the underworld.

514
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,680
Except for one.

515
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,680
One man can save the world.

516
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,680
One hero can save mankind.

517
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,680
One son of a bitch who can kick some serious demoness.

518
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,680
He's faceless.

519
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
He's fearless.

520
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
King.

521
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,680
His black shadow.

522
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,680
From the mind of Davey Patti of Bogothar, Steve Sailor.

523
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,680
And brought to you by Pod Show.

524
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Comes a story where the only thing standing in between total destruction.

525
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,680
And peace on earth is the craziest and most kickass some of a bitch to ever wear a costume.

526
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,680
Where the superpowers meet the supernatural.

527

Way to be finds the demons first.

532
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Before the demons find you.

533
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,680

Go over there and check out Steve Sailor.net.

535
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
That sounds pretty good.

536
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,680
Of course, that was Nemcoff.

537
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
He always sounds good.

538
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,680
I just wish I had more time.

539
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,680
These days on my flights, my transatlantic flights.

540
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
I'm just sleeping.

541
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,680
I got no time to listen to anything.

542
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
I try.

543
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,680
I listen to a couple of audio books, audio podcasts, books,

544
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
audio books.

545
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
I guess I called.

546
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,680
And I'll just wind up falling asleep with your buds jammed in my ear.

547
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,680
I wonder if the whole book plays out.

548
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,680
Did I actually hear it?

549
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,680
You know, it's not in my ears or clothes.

550
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,680
But that register in my brain will I be able to pull out passages from these books?

551
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Interesting question, huh?

552
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,680
I'm surprised.

553
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,680
Come extra blogger didn't call this one.

554
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,680
Being our official EU correspondent.

555
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,680
Alan, the Britain Basel sent in this wonderful piece of news,

556
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,680
which I presume is correct to EU Parliament.

557
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Nearly throughout a vote that would have banned files

558
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,680
sharing by private individuals and decided against

559
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,680
banning copyright abuses from the internet.

560
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,680
This, of course, is a three strikes your out rule.

561
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,680
With the idea is, if you're caught once caught twice,

562
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,680
the third time you get caught fasharing illegal files,

563
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,680
or sparing files illegally because it's copyrighted material,

564
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,680
you would then forever be cut off from the internet.

565
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,680
You would not be able to get internet service.

566
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,680
It was a very narrow vote.

567
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,680
314 to 297.

568
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,680
Wow.

569
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,680
297 idiots still thought that was a good idea.

570
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,680
But the way this has been instituted, or similar laws

571
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,680
are in place if anyone's in France.

572
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
If you listen to the show, call it.

573
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Let me know exactly what the rules are.

574
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,680
If you do have this three strikes your out law.

575
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,680
But it looks like for now, for now.

576
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,680
We're in good shape.

577
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,680
Let me see, what is it end up here?

578
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,680
It's expected that you'd expect to have this,

579
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
oh, this is France.

580
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
Of course it's expected to take advantage of it coming

581
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
presidency of the European Union.

582
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
And the second half of this year to have another crack

583
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,680
crack it, creating this law. Okay, let's be on the lookout folks, because France is going

584
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,920
to try it. They're going to try and push their law through to the rest of us, and clearly

585
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:08,400
this is not a good idea. And if they do push something like through like that, you know,

586
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,800
well, then maybe I want to have some files banned. Maybe I'll call all kinds of stuff copyright

587
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,080
that you can't touch. Ah, an crazy world, aren't we? Hey, let's come back to the Chinese

588
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,520
thing because the PD love sent in something really cool that I just wanted to play for you guys.

589
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,840
Yeah, and PD love from the daddy cast and love house radio. And I don't know, can I be

590
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,240
called the official introologist on the show? Yeah, I know. Yeah, Louis, the judge.

591
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,800
Anyway, I wanted to comment on the push to stop buying products made in China. If you're

592
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:41,360
indeed going to protest China's oppression of Tibet. Yeah, and before you get into it, a lot of

593
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,040
people misunderstood what I was saying. You know, I got a lot of emails saying, you know, you're a

594
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,680
Mr. Gadget guy. What are you talking about? You're a horrible example. Look, I'm yelling at myself here

595
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,760
as well, right? If we really want to protest what China's doing, then yeah, the Olympics is a

596
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,640
great way to get some public stuff on the public forum, but really the way to do it is to boycott

597
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,160
products that are coming out of China. And unfortunately, stuff like your iPod comes out of China.

598
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,040
But I just picture a big pile of iPods on fire, like the burning bras of the 60s.

599
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,480
But a question, who's actually going to have the guts to do this or the the pocket to do this?

600
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,920
I mean, what are the alternatives? You know, you mentioned the Taiwan iPods,

601
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,520
well, that would be one alternative, but there's the older ones. Well, the hold on a second,

602
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:30,080
PD. So that would be Apple's decision, right? And I'm sure that Taiwan can do perfect manufacturing.

603
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,200
Yeah, they did the first gen iPods, but I don't think that's, you know, that all their iPods

604
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,600
were look like first generation iPods. But it's Apple, you know, it's like, so you're right,

605
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,320
your point is, who's going to boycott Apple? Can we really stay away from that new iPhone 3G that's

606
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,600
coming out? No, we probably can. Are there other MP3 players made in the US or somewhere else?

607
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Yes, most definitely. I'm sure there are. If not, let's start making some.

608
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,560
You know, what about our PCs? How much of that of our just our computers are made in China?

609
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,840
So all of it. I just wonder, you know, can the anti-China protesters give up? Can they give up

610
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,640
convenience and the investments in what they've already got? Can they give up the convenience of

611
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,080
finding things? Once they decide to stop buying Chinese products? Hey, kids, he's talking to you, okay?

612
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,600
And to me, because this is the question. Are we really willing to look at the label on everything

613
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,560
and say, hey, it's coming from China? I'm out. Because that's the simplest. That's within your

614
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,720
power. You don't have to go on the street. You don't have to demonstrate. You don't have to yell.

615
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:35,280
You don't have to cause unrest. At least not civil unrest because this will hurt the entire

616
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:42,320
system. Just stop buying products from China and tell the companies that produce products in China

617
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,200
that you're not going to be their customer anymore. It's not easy. But I bet you're most of

618
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,240
your all-talk. Or did too many people just, you know, take up the cause for the cause, you know,

619
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,160
say, oh, I'm protesting the China for Tibet, but don't really know what all that mean. Yeah, I call

620
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,200
that the Nup the Gay Wales syndromes. And, you know, are they willing to trade in their luxury for the

621
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,800
cause? I remember, back when I was in college, a comedian came in, stood up on stage and said,

622
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,080
who out here is a vegetarian or a member of PETA or anything that's one girl enthusiastically

623
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,240
waved her hand? He was taking you stand up for a minute, you stood up, he goes, yeah, nice leather

624
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,160
belt. So it just kind of, I think sometimes people state their fur cause, but really don't have

625
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:30,720
the heart behind it that it takes to stand up for that cause. But anyway, just wanted to throw

626
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,400
in my two cents of that and to see what you thought about options to actually boycott products from

627
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,760
China and how that could be accomplished. One other Nup, I have your attention on the Daddycast 146.

628
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,480
I had a special co-host and with CC Chapman, we had a chance to talk a little bit about fatherhood

629
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,960
and so forth. Yeah, I think it was a great time and hey, if you ever get a chance, feel free to let

630
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,960
me know. We'll get you on the show as well to talk about all of your challenges as a father.

631
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,520
Yeah, sure thing. Anyway, great hair, hope you win everything else. And I guess I've never really

632
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,360
given you my stats. I'm a dad 38 years old. I'm a general manager of a software development company

633
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,760
specializing in the brokerage industry. So some of the financial costs are really interesting and

634
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:20,320
actually makes sense. Anyway, that is my bio. So in short form, I will talk to you later at

635
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,480
him. Bye, bye. Hi, man. Thank you. Appreciate the thought. Absolutely. And I'm glad you brought it up, man.

636
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,760
That's totally totally spot on. Now, I would have to participate in this as well.

637
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,200
Okay. That's why the first thing I want to find out was what's going on between China and Tibet.

638
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,080
But you know what, when you look at the grand scale of things, you know, all of the things we're accusing

639
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,320
the Chinese of. We're doing too. You know, we totally have slave, slave labor here.

640
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:53,040
Slavery and here is well, probably. But in the US, we detained people unlawfully.

641
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,520
There's all kind of, we do all the same things. Except we have different words for it.

642
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,000
You know, we invade other people's countries. So, you know, is it

643
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,560
popcorn the kettle black? And maybe the best way is to change behaviors to show it through

644
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:17,600
leadership and to do it, you know, to lead by example. So I would love to hear from you guys.

645
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,080
Are we willing to give up all of our products from China or not? You've got the voicemail lines

646
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,840
right there on the in the show notes at dailysourceco.com and at curry.com.

647
00:36:52,720 --> 00:37:00,880
I'll do nothing. The Charlie said, love you. No home move. I mean, it's big here.

648
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,560
Oh, they were there. Okay. Catch you later.

649
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,000
Oh, a chemist, chemist. That's the way you pronounce it. Sorry.

650
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,320
Yeah. Unfortunately, that promotion is coming to an end. Today is actually the last day.

651
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:20,320
You can go to pachowoffers.com slash n-800-10. You can just find it at pachowoffers.com.

652
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,000
And you want to use my DSC checkout code for a 15% discount. I was actually I was playing with the

653
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,840
N-800-10 over the weekend. For two reasons. One, I wanted to, you know, I was looking for a way

654
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:40,160
to get my aircraft flight tracks on to Google Earth and there's an application called Memo

655
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,840
Mapper. There's a couple of them, actually. That's why I was fooling around testing a few out.

656
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,960
And of course, this has a built-in GPS receiver. So it's exactly what I need. You know, I

657
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,160
easy to get the file off into Google Earth. So I was a mess around with that. And then I really

658
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:02,080
got back into Gizmo. And Gizmo is a VoIP client. And it uses the Open Standard and IETF standard,

659
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:10,960
which is the SIP protocol SIP. Excuse me. Which is, you know, so basically Gizmo is, you know,

660
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,320
a version of software that you can use with the SIP protocol. There's tons of service providers

661
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,400
and software that you can use and install. And I have to say, I'm pretty impressed. There's

662
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,440
lots of really good implementations of this spec and of the software that really surpasses Skype

663
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,120
and quality, which is why I'm interested in it. Because of course, you know, I'm doing this show

664
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:39,120
weekly with the, with the VORAC, no agenda.podshow.com. And, you know, so you have all the, in this

665
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:45,120
particular software Gizmo, which is available for Mac PC for the internet tablet from Nokia,

666
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:52,240
even on your, my E61I, you can get calling out minutes, you know, get inbound phone lines,

667
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,720
it has chat, it even has video, which is on the internet, what a great implementation. It does video

668
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,560
and voice, you know, spectacularly, even on the built-in mic and speakers with no echo. And I was

669
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:11,040
really, I was playing with the Candy Man Luke. Yeah, let me rephrase that. I was playing around

670
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:19,040
with Gizmo, calling Candy Man Luke. And I was, I was quite surprised. I'm going to keep

671
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,320
by using that for a little while. And what I'm looking for now is a client that I can actually plug

672
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,360
into my, into my setup. The Gizmo itself doesn't do it. I have to be able to choose a different

673
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,520
sound device and have to be able to route it through Jack router. If that means anything to anybody,

674
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,480
you'll pick up on it. You'll send me an email, I hope. But most of these clients aren't,

675
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:44,800
aren't good enough in a crash or they're not fully developed. So I'm still kind of hunting around

676
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,960
for stuff. But in general, just as a voiceover IP client and system, I'm very impressed, far superior

677
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,920
to Skype, although of course, of course, no one uses it, which is another downside.

678
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:05,520
Let me see. I got one more here that I just wanted to play. This is regarding drop.io,

679
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,000
which I've been cleaning it out. It's not an archive, even though it does have a handy

680
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,600
blog type format, but it's just a great way to put files up. Drop me a note, send me a link to

681
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,920
something. It's a perfect place to do all that. And I'll put it into the show notes regularly now.

682
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,360
It's drop.io slash daily source code. And Eric added something that I left up there. You definitely

683
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,800
need to check out. Yeah, I'm Eric from Portland. I just want to draw your attention to it. Email

684
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:40,320
exempts you today. Thursday. On the sub-prime mortgage message, it brings to a Google notebook

685
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:48,080
and 45 slides of little stick figures. And it's almost yet how a sub-prime mortgage is originated.

686
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:59,600
How it becomes a AAA paper. And why we're all fucked. I think I like it. And click over to it

687
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,600
and see if you want to add it to the show. Love you, Ben. Bye.

688
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:40,320
Good evening, I would like to report on the state over the war against American people.

689
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:50,240
We're mounting a sustained campaign to crack down on every American and every person of every

690
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:59,120
faith in every nation and to bring them to justice. All missions are being executed according

691
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:06,240
to plan without warning or provocation. Americans are being swept up in the international

692
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:13,360
drag net. Thousands of FBI agents drawn to 12 of other citizens here in abroad. It has everything

693
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:18,800
to do with aid and evil. And murder in prison. America's strong strong strong strong strong.

694
00:42:43,360 --> 00:43:07,520
I see a message from the government like every day. I'll watch it and listen and call them all

695
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:13,440
fuckers. They want to be about a summer or whatever. Pitching me behind the scam I said never.

696
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,720
You went through a hard tool, so just beaten. I'll stay committed, gives up to that loose commission.

697
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,120
It's all about a fight and never state my control. And all about the battle for your body,

698
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,680
mine and soul. And now open you don't tell your mind, so they shape you. Don't forget they made a

699
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,240
slave, gave a say, then rapist. Another push season, mean another war for profit. All the

700
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,040
secrets of the public never fit to stop. The aluminum and nutty triple six all connected.

701
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,680
Throw the post, take control of race and take elections. It's the stolen bones, remakes and kill

702
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,040
committing. See the dragon get shitty or in every city.

703
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:10,000
Now ask yourself who's the one with the most again. All I love and motherfuckers couldn't

704
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,040
stand his name. Not even Dickens waving flags like they all stay mine. Everybody got opinions

705
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,280
but don't know the time, because America's been took. It's playing the seat. The oldest

706
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,320
trick in the book is making enemies. A phone to evil, so a couple makings to his dirt. And take

707
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,200
okay your freedom, knocking low in search. And then change one more fellow people locked in prison.

708
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,200
He's picked still beat us, but it seems we forget. But I remember folks that pimple

709
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,760
hide his devil's do it. Fucked truly, honey. Asked y'all a while he's doing. We in the streets

710
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,000
hall a jail to the people. Follow, fuck, wave your flags, bring his back and sit a knees.

711
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,320
Boy, oh, blood, honey, make these killers ride cold. I'm suspicious through with five people dying

712
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,800
never told. It's all the part of playing cards, so you think we need them. I'm being ash

713
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,480
cross, take away your rights to freedom and bail goodness to the sickness of these

714
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,480
tiktakers. Hope you want to stay in the time, brother, because this makes you.

715
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,880
So now you ask and why my records always come the same. Keep it real in the fillers,

716
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,400
motherfuck a blingin'. My eyes seem to gory at a comin' up the beast. So every story, every word I'm saying,

717
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,880
fuck peace. If you could witness to your lumen, I'd be by the count. Don't be surprised. These

718
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,760
levels that I'm talkin' bow. You think a couple thousand lies mean shit to killers. And they got spread

719
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,400
of God. We're the ones ain't no villain. Or any other world they think to demonize a country. And

720
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,560
don't tear it threaten us. I prove we're waiting slumping. So I'm a sayin' for the record. We don't

721
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,040
want that plan. Ain't no one in the country, took upon a head of hand in. Just a way to keep

722
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,200
your scary. So you think you need them. Praise and push, why not kill or take away your freedom.

723
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,600
How many apples got discovered, but ignore the symptoms. Nick is talkin' loud, but ain't nobody

724
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,920
saying shit. And we're the four of them ain't gone. I was all in the first. That's why I'm spitting

725
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,560
side of night, each and every verse. I see the corn loud, poopin' Harris, make a count. I see

726
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:14,080
them be the fifth, each and every session now. And why I stand burn, see the public by it. I see the

727
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:18,240
profile, and see the media is compliant. The war's good for business, see the vicious, make a

728
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,440
safe. I hope you understand the time, but the cutters' rage.

729
00:46:48,240 --> 00:47:10,240
You can't imagine how much money they've spent trying to silence. Good people who put their lives

730
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:18,720
on the line to fight for change. Hell yeah, I think this is going to be the new anthem.

731
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,600
You know what, if you have a podcast, you must play this song. The first example I've heard of

732
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,560
someone actually just laid it out there saying it in every single lyric throughout the entire track.

733
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,680
That is Paris. What would you do? What would you do, my friends? That's the question

734
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,280
and we'll be talking about it later on this week. So until we speak again, email me,

735
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:44,960
adamotpodshow.com, drop some files into the drop drop.io slash daily source code. And of course,

736
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,120
daily source code.com is where you can find the show notes for this program. Until we speak

737
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,440
in next time, my friends, live your life with passion and fight for your freedom.
