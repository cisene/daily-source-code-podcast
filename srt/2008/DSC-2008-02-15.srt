It's up in the back of me, I don't want to let it go, no, no, no

10
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:35,900
I think that's the time, let's have my daily breaks down one

11
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,900
Just want to make you feel me never, I'm old and so old

I think that's the time, let's have my daily breaks down one

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,900
Just want to make you feel me never, I'm old and so old

00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,900
I think that's the time, let's have my daily breaks down one

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:07,900
Just want to make you feel me never, I'm old and so old

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,900
When I call you make you feel me never, I'm old and so old

17
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:21,900
I think that's the time, let's have my daily break down one

18
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,900
Just want to make you feel me never, I'm old and so old

19
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,900
I think that's the time, let's have my daily breaks down one

20
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,200
Auntie und I'm the time.

21
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,900
That's a potty big someone.

22
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,060
Just want to make me go, go, be mine,

23
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,220
oh oh, yeah, oh, baby.

24
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,080
Help myself.

25
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,520
oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh, baby.

28
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,900
Man, there's nothing like a party band track to kick off the weekend is there and of course

29
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,900
Here on the Charlie we consider Fridays to be a part of the official weekend

30
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:20,400
We have can't help myself the remix Amy Winehouse of course with the four tops kicking off today's episode number

31
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:27,100
724 the daily source code coming to you from the curry manner. We're up in the attic in the affluent subwoofer

32
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,100
Suri known as Guilford

33
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,100
I love this track man. That's awesome. Hey, this is the official load latency

34
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,100
No stuttering edition of the show. I've actually

35
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,100
You know, I actually already kind of did the show for like 60% of it and said, you know what?

36
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,100
The sound was so messed up screw it. I'm gonna take this one over take it back and do it all over again

37
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,100
He doesn't mean a show ain't full bar just my setup got it all fixed up now though

38
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,100
We can figure it out some more stuff with Ableton Live not gonna bore you with that today

39
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Because we got to keep the music flown. We got to keep the angry brids coming in because I got a couple as promised yesterday

40
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:13,100
All of that and more on today's food bar Friday edition of the daily source code episode numbers of the 724 his Rex Clamp

41
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:19,100
Jim beam in the morning Jack Daniel's a night sometimes need a little vodka

42
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:26,100
I'm making a feel on right lately. I've been drinking all the captains here at my room

43
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:33,100
But I just called my deal. I said man. You got to give me some cause the weed is my need

44
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
The weed is what I mean

45
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:45,100
All this liquor is gonna kill my cause the weed is what I need

46
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,100
First time that I tried it

47
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,100
There's a much younger man

48
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,100
And now I want to do it and it's time that I can't

49
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Some folks think it's bad

50
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,100
Well, I'll think that they're wrong

51
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,100
Hey, I like it so much

52
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,100
I just have to write the song

53
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,100
It holds the weed in what I mean

54
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,100
The weed in what I mean

55
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:20,100
All this liquor is gonna kill my cause the weed is what I mean

56
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
All give it to my man

57
00:07:42,100 --> 00:08:03,100
What if we're feeling bad?

58
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
I just listen to me

59
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,100
I've got the answer for your relief

60
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
Don't drown in that whiskey

61
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
Don't swim in that wrong

62
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
But just roll a fat ass

63
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Move it to its guy

64
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,100
And it holds the weed in what I mean

65
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,100
The weed in what I mean

66
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:32,100
All this liquor is gonna kill my cause the weed is what I mean

67
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:50,100
All this liquor is gonna kill my cause the weed is what I mean

68
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
Call the end

69
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,100
I've never heard of all this liquor

70
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,100
You're gonna kill my cause the weed is what I mean

71
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:06,100
Rex, he claimed the weed is what I need from the pod save music network

72
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Excellent

73
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Links to that song and everything else played on today's show at datingsourcecode.com

74
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Delicate balancing act today, my friends

75
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
It's what time is it now?

76
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
It's 3.39

77
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,100
I actually already did about 60% of the show and kind of modeled through it

78
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,100
It was extremely distracted by the setup crunching and skipping

79
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,100
So I know that I'm on the cutting edge of technology here

80
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Because I'm literally working with audio devices, MIDI devices, processing, chains

81
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,100
Doing everything to keep the processor level of this MacBook Pro

82
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Which is running everything now

83
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,100
It's all completely internalized except for the microphone going in

84
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,100
The external Fader Fox MIDI controller which is just the hottest thing I've had

85
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,100
And here is I love it

86
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,100
So I have to keep this latency otherwise latency kicks in on the program

87
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,100
And then it starts to crackle all that shit you heard yesterday and earlier in the week

88
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,100
So I think I finally found the perfect balance I'm very excited about it

89
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,100
So we'll see how it all goes today on this show

90
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Which is of course the football variety of the daily source code

91
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,100
I promised you yesterday was it yesterday or the day before

92
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
No, yesterday was Valentine's Day

93
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,100
What am I talking about?

94
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,100
I got to tell you that Patricia and I went out for a Valentine's Day

95
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,100
It was awesome we went to see strictly come dancing at the O2 Arena

96
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Which was great

97
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,100
You know we're big fans

98
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,100
This is strictly come dancing of course is the original format of what you in the states

99
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Or another country's on the world would know as dancing with the stars

100
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,100
And Patricia of course participated in the Christmas special in the Netherlands

101
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,100
And we've been big fans of the show here

102
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,100
And I've watched it pretty much religiously

103
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,100
So they have the tour version which is essentially it's the television format on stage

104
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
It's crazy

105
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,100
They don't have Brucey who is you know the major host they have the co-host as the show

106
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,100
A couple of the stars the one the only two people I was really interested in watching

107
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Matt and Flavia Matt plays or played I guess character on East Enders

108
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:25,100
And Flavia who already had a you know she's a world-class dancer

109
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,100
She's I think she's a world champion and maybe Latin or something like that

110
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:37,100
She and her partner but actually she and Matt hooked up during the you know because it's really intense stuff during the series

111
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,100
And they're just cute the great to look at when they dance

112
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,100
Anyway, so we had a great time and today of course is Friday

113
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:49,100
And I was referring back to the comments that I promised you I would play some of these angry brick comments

114
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:55,100
Now one person who called in when I started talking about the Snoop Dogg nation the surveillance state of the United Kingdom

115
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
One guy who called in

116
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,100
Let's do a little bit more reverb here hold on one two two two

117
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,100
There we go that's better. I can now control all of that manually. I love it

118
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
Maybe that's a little much. There we go

119
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:16,100
One guy got called in was his name is Bob and Bob said a couple of things that I I didn't necessarily agree with what he was saying

120
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:22,100
But I've heard them said many times before here in the UK and in the US and other countries around the world

121
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:28,100
And I kind of let it go in the hope that someone would pick up on it and and someone would say something

122
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,100
And thank goodness there is a comment

123
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Adam Jason from San Diego

124
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,100
I'm calling about Bob

125
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:46,100
I found his last couple of statements in your agreements with his statements a little just

126
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,100
Disconcerning

127
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:55,100
Bob's last statements about the country where there's Polish coming in

128
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Moving in

129
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Working on the cheap jobs

130
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,100
Send in all their money back outside of Poland

131
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,100
And they're filling up the hospitals

132
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Having date

133
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,100
Now the hospitals are probably already full

134
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,100
I don't think the polls are having that much more

135
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,100
But sure there might be more coming in

136
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Lower income folks to tend to have more children

137
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,100
You know the only form of entertainment

138
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,100
But

139
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,100
The overall argument that they come in

140
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,100
Send them money out

141
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,100
This always been one that's pissed me

142
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,100
The fuck off

143
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,100
All right, so before you continue with all that

144
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Let me just tell you that I'm happy you picked up on this because

145
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,100
I've heard that said a lot too and I happen to disagree with it

146
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,100
I don't think there's any chance that foreign workers are really taking away all these jobs

147
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,100
Taking away jobs mind you

148
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,100
I think that they're doing jobs a lot of

149
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,100
The native citizens just don't want to do

150
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,100
And then as always the you know they use up all of our services

151
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,100
Well clearly if they're in here and they're in here legally

152
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Which as far as I know

153
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Most of the polls would be

154
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,100
And by the way they're allowed to move around Europe

155
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,100
And work in different member states which is why you sign up to the European Union

156
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,100
That's a part of the deal

157
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Okay

158
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,100
So I'm sure that they're paying taxes which cover their

159
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,100
You know their usage of services such as healthcare

160
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,100
But you're right man, it's something that you hear over and over and over again

161
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Except you never really hear the set on television or in the mainstream media

162
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Because this is what everyone says on the street

163
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,100
But once they're offered the opportunity to say it in public

164
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,100
You know in like a big mass audience public

165
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,100
No one really comes out and just says it

166
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Just says what they feel whether it's right or wrong

167
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Whether it's true or false you never ever hear that

168
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,100
So I'm so happy that Bob said it

169
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,100
And I'm so happy that you're picking up on it

170
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,100
And let's hear how pissed off you are about it

171
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Because they say the same thing here in the United States about Mexican

172
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:17,100
And I just I don't buy the idea that the folks who come in

173
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Do the labor have money paid go to state taxes

174
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
Local taxes

175
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
Municipal taxes

176
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
Of course the hands federal taxes

177
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,100
They get to spend they never get to take any benefit from it

178
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,100
They never get to vote on how it's spent

179
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,100
They don't even see any

180
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:50,100
Or they don't have any desire to influence how it's spent

181
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,100
Because they understand that there is not their country

182
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
They're just here doing a job

183
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,100
But they get no respect

184
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,100
They work hard

185
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:10,100
If they if the jobs weren't there they wouldn't come

186
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,100
They would stay if they could afford it

187
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,100
But they would stay if they were welcomed

188
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,100
But they're not and they can't afford it

189
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
So you know what you're going to do

190
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,100
Send them any back home where it goes for miles and miles

191
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Live like a king

192
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Work hard in another state or another country

193
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
And you

194
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,100
Jason San Diego

195
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Later

196
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Jason, thanks man

197
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,100
Where were you calling from your helicopter?

198
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,100
Sounded like it

199
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Yep, I agree

200
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
And this is of course extremely dangerous

201
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,100
I think it's in a way it's called

202
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,100
It's called nationalism

203
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,100
I think it's dangerous when people start to talk that way

204
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,100
And this is from very intelligent people is just they're hurting

205
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,100
People are hurting and you know it's easy to turn around and point a finger at somebody

206
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,100
And that has happened in the past and it wasn't really good

207
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Was it now?

208
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
So

209
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Speaking of pointing the finger James

210
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,100
Frequent caller of the show

211
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,100
Took some offense to my finger pointing

212
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Adam's James

213
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:20,100
But a demand for lessons to them that it's not really how it is going around a fucking tool

214
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,100
I'm not going to a problem

215
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,100
I just like know exactly how it is of a fucking tool

216
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,100
Because to say somebody's a fucking tool

217
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,100
Very easy

218
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,100
Adam Curry is a fucking tool

219
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,100
James is a fucking tool

220
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,100
How is he a fucking tool?

221
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,100
Jim that's fighting

222
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,100
If you're being used as a tool then you're a tool

223
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,100
I just added the fucking part in for color and flavor

224
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
And of course he's a tool

225
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,100
He's a tool of the whoever the hell runs the world

226
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
The new world order he's a part of it

227
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
I'm convinced of that

228
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,100
Look at what he's done with Northern Rock

229
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,100
And by the way the latest reports there is that

230
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,100
There's still a good chance the bank will be nationalized

231
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,100
Instead of rescued by

232
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Let's see the only bitter left on the outside is virgin money

233
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,100
And the reason is because virgin wants to

234
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,100
Bring in like something over a billion pounds

235
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,100
Which will dilute all of the shareholders which will mean

236
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,100
They'll have less share of the bank instead of an alternative plan

237
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,100
So again doing it all for the shareholders

238
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,100
And not for the people whose money it actually is

239
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
And yes some of that is mine

240
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
I pay taxes here

241
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,100
Oh man

242
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,100
It's messed up

243
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,100
I'm not even going to get into that non-domiciled thing today

244
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,100
I'll do that on Monday

245
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Because there's a whole row going on about that too

246
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
But yeah

247
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,100
And by the way look at what Gordon Brown is doing to help out

248
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,100
You know the surveillance society

249
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
The Snoop Dogg nation

250
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Set up by new labor Tony Blair

251
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,100
You know all this you can't protest within a half a mile of

252
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,100
Parliament and now Gordon Brown saying hey well you know

253
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,100
Some of this intercept

254
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Should be admissible in court

255
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,100
Oh man come on James

256
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,100
He's a fucking tool and you know it too

257
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,100
You really is

258
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,100
You know you said you don't know you

259
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
We will blah blah blah blah

260
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,100
And then spend the night in all of them

261
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:26,100
Do you honestly seriously think that you don't know

262
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,100
And then spend the night in all of them

263
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,100
Do you honestly seriously think that things don't

264
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,100
Being booked in the states and in France and Germany

265
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,100
No James one second of course I do

266
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100
Of course I do

267
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,100
That's the reason why I'm trying to wake everybody up here

268
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100
You guys got to get with it

269
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,100
This has to stop this lunacy

270
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,100
And in the states you know

271
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,100
We're once again up against this horrific bill

272
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,100
That is now passed the Senate and Congress has to stop this

273
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,100
Which would give immunity

274
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,100
To all the telecommunications companies who illegally wire

275
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,100
Tap to American citizens to help the government without any appropriate warrants

276
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,100
I mean that shit has to be stopped dead in his tracks

277
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,100
Oh no James this is exactly why I'm talking about this here in the UK

278
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,100
But there is one big difference here everyone's just letting

279
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,100
Letting themselves be steam rolled

280
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,100
It's like where is the outrage about 800 different organizations

281
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Or yeah organizations in the UK that can actually request an intercept

282
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,100
IE a wire tap or an Eschalon

283
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,100
Trying to get picked up by the filters Eschalon type filter

284
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,100
That'll read your email and see what websites you're surfing

285
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,100
So of course it's happening worldwide

286
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,100
I'd like to wake up the Brits because I happen to live here James

287
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,100
And I'd like it. I like it here. I want it to be better

288
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,100
I mean you're the pivier of the red pill for folks sick

289
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,100
We go out and this is going on worldwide

290
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,100
Just have a chance to wake up

291
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,100
We as a global community are being watched by the few all the time

292
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100
And you can think that's conspiracy theories

293
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,100
You can think of a little fucked up in the head

294
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,100
But take a little bit more of a take a few more red pills

295
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,100
Because this is going on everywhere

296
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,100
You're being watched all the time

297
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,100
Adam Curry is being watched as he goes through the airport

298
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,100
He's been watched on the internet

299
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,100
He's got these mobile phone calls and it happens to everybody

300
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
And it happens everywhere throughout the world

301
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100
Doesn't matter where you live

302
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,100
Sorry mate but that's the way it is

303
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,100
That's okay James

304
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,100
But that doesn't make it right or doesn't make it something that we should

305
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,100
Allow to continue to happen

306
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,100
It has to stop

307
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,100
And you know now that I'm learning that you can't even protest here

308
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,100
Or not with any reasonable ease

309
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,100
You know we've got to wake up from this apathy

310
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:57,100
Alan the Britain Basel sent in an email about a show coming on this Sunday evening on the BBC

311
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,100
BBC one called the last enemy

312
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,100
Typical theme that of being constantly under surveillance

313
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,100
The BBC's last enemy website states that in this show

314
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,100
Britain has been transformed into a security state after a major terrorist attack

315
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,100
ID cards are strictly enforced in citizens every movement is watched

316
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,100
So the government can catch the terrorists before they strike again

317
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,100
A situation of course at many genuinely fear and in some instances

318
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,100
Even hope for will become a reality

319
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,100
I got to check that out for sure

320
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
I'm not leaving for San Francisco until Monday

321
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,100
It's president's day on Monday

322
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,100
So I might as well just travel on a day when no one's working anyway

323
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,100
And parky sent some awesome stuff in

324
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,100
He says that he picked up confessions of an economic hitman after I pitched it here on the show

325
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,100
He says since then my red pill side has gone wild

326
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,100
I'd already got stuck into the book of taking liberties by Chris Atkins before you mentioned it

327
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,100
Of course that you can see that series

328
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,100
I still have a link on it's actually embedded at curry dot com taking liberties

329
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,100
You've got to see this

330
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,100
And he has some quotes here

331
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,100
He says or well here's or well

332
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,100
I think these are all or well quotes

333
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,100
Go read this go read or read

334
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,100
1984 you won't be disappointed I'm telling you

335
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,100
Here's a couple quotes

336
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
In the time of universal deceit

337
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,100
Telling the truth will be a revolutionary act

338
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,100
A family with the wrong members in control that perhaps as near as you

339
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,100
One can come to describing England in a single phrase

340
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,100
Oh man

341
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,100
Early in life I'd notice that no event is ever correctly reported in a newspaper

342
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:40,100
If you want a vision of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever

343
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,100
Man

344
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,100
And then finally

345
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,100
He who controls the past controls the future

346
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,100
Who controls the present

347
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,100
Controls the past

348
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Yeah or well a genius indeed

349
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,100
Hey Adam it's Jamie Gummy

350
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,100
You're calling up your call for three people to come up to the plate

351
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,100
Yeah

352
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,100
Well I've got a poll just so that's all about the call quality

353
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,100
It does probably quite shortly

354
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,100
I couldn't agree more

355
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Basically after listening

356
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,100
Yeah you know I thought really quite a shame

357
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,100
You know we should be causing more of a fuss

358
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,100
We should have a bit more firing on there

359
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,100
We should be just saying hey we're not going to take the sort of thing

360
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
Right on

361
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,100
Crime example

362
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,100
The data that went missing

363
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,100
All that child agency data that went missing

364
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,100
There was a big colabaloo for a couple of days

365
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,100
And then what I don't understand is why no one has a certain sort of class action

366
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,100
So sure we can see you know

367
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,100
I'm showing people can see the government

368
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,100
They saw a thing and just they look

369
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Oh yeah I mean

370
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,100
Surely you can but you got to actually do it

371
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,100
We need that kind of fire man

372
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,100
The stuff that I'm hearing from you

373
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,100
We got to step up and do something

374
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,100
That's why I'm really big on this flash mob stuff

375
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,100
I really hope we can get that started

376
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,100
It would be a lot of fun too

377
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
We're not going to take this

378
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,100
This is just not acceptable

379
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,100
And today I even saw that they're now trying to push through a pipe

380
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,100
Like a three stripes and you're out

381
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,100
For now my respect

382
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,100
Respected legal material

383
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,100
Copyright infringement

384
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,100
Yeah I talked about that early in the week

385
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,100
Indeed

386
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,100
And this is a proposed bill

387
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,100
It's a green paper

388
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,100
So it's a way it's a way off from actually being effectuated

389
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,100
But just the fact that people are thinking this way in parliament is nuts

390
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,100
So you're going to listen to you're going to intercept all of my internet traffic

391
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,100
And probably slow it down in the process

392
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,100
And the only reason you're doing that is to find out if I've downloaded something illegally

393
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,100
You know so where's that database reside

394
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,100
Where you can find out every single piece of content

395
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,100
And maybe I have some content that's being downloaded illegally

396
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,100
Can I make use of this as well?

397
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,100
Ah fuck I didn't give a shit about that

398
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
Stop snooping on me

399
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
Don't snoop

400
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,100
Dog

401
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,100
Nation

402
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,100
If you're called three times you're off the internet for good

403
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,100
Adam, I couldn't agree more

404
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,100
We're just totally out of self-gootweaver

405
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:10,100
And I'm totally up to doing the flash mob and standing up

406
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
I'm just kicking out

407
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,100
I am 28 years old living in Birmingham

408
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,100
I'm a programmer

409
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,100
And I know it's been a while but you've got all the news sign off

410
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
Great head

411
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,100
Love you

412
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,100
No, I'm on take care

413
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,100
I'll speak to you later

414
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
Hi man, thank you

415
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,100
We need more people like you

416
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:36,100
And I've purposely not started winding up the flash mob

417
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,100
Where you know the idea is everyone wears t-shirts that say

418
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,100
You work for us and we just created a couple of these flash mobs really quick

419
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:48,100
Of course completely within the half mile perimeter of Parliament

420
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
Because it's not actually a demonstration

421
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,100
We're just kind of all flashing mobbing flash mobbing together

422
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,100
So that's a big difference, isn't there?

423
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,100
By the way, Birmingham, I heard yesterday

424
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,100
You know you'd be 40

425
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,100
They're from Birmingham and I heard that like 20 years ago

426
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
Maybe even longer than 20 years ago

427
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,100
When those guys first got started they purchased

428
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,100
You know the building

429
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,100
That they were I guess working in or living in in the middle of Birmingham

430
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
And bought a couple of buildings around it

431
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,100
Which is now pretty much the center of Birmingham

432
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
And these guys own it

433
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,100
They're like set for life and then some

434
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,100
Which is really cool when you just see those guys stoned it out on stage

435
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,100
Hey, there's a new episode of Dr. Cockney

436
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,100
If you haven't seen them international sex therapist

437
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,100
Let's try that again

438
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:40,100
International sex that's

439
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
Fuck me

440
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,100
What are you saying?

441
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
I love it

442
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,100
I know

443
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,100
You know what I know sex is a tool?

444
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,100
Yeah

445
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Do you think women are really bothered about the size of your male men but

446
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,100
Yes, she's a lot in your house

447
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,100
You're sexy man

448
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,100
Yeah

449
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,100
That's right

450
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,100
I just go to podshow.com and search for

451
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,100
Dr. Cockney

452
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,100
International sex therapist.bt podshow.com

453
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,100
There I got it out

454
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,100
I got it out

455
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,100
I had them

456
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,100

Was a summer of 169

00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,100
Let's get it out of your mother's voice

517
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,100
You told me that it lasts forever

518
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:15,100
And for the best things of my life

519
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,100
Oh yeah

520
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,100

00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,100
Brian Adams answered number two

523
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,100
Now what was this?

524
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,100

529
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,100
Girl you'd be my jeans come to you

530
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,100
You make my jeans come to you

531
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,100
I just want to be close to you

532
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,100

533
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:53,100

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,100
How did you do?

539
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,100

562
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,100
Thanks Gary

563
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,100
And uh and John of course

564
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,100
One oh nine already man

565
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,100
Can you believe that shit

566
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,100
And I was listening to the Brian Adams track

567
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,100
And I was thinking of myself

568
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,100
For years

569
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,100
I thought the first lyric to that was

570
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,100
Had my first real sex dream

571
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,100
But of course it was sixth dream

572
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,100
And I was thinking you know

573
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,100
I think we did this a couple of years ago

574
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,100
When I was at the cottage

575
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,100
If you have any messed up sound

576
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,100
A mess up song lyric that you want to share with us

577
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,100
Something that you completely

578
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,100
Were mistaken on and sang for years

579
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,100
Probably much to your embarrassment

580
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,100
When you found out

581
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,100
Uh

582
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,100
If it voted in

583
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,100
And uh we can probably do something

584
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,100
With the organization to the preservation

585
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,100
For the soundtrack of our lives

586
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,100
And uh and play some of the

587
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,100
Of the original tracks along with it

588
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,100
Uh it would be a hood

589
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,100
It's the football Friday

590
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,100
It is the day the source code

591
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,100
It's episode 724

592
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:51,100
We've got a review of Burnout Paradise on the Xbox 360 in PlayStation 3

593
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,100
We put our thinking caps on with Zach and Wicky on the way

594
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,100
We also get a little look at the story

595
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,100
All humans on the way as well

596
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,100
And you can win one of five copies of a real tournament

597
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,100
Three on the PlayStation 3

598
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,100
That's all at gamesweasel.btpodshow.com

599
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Your honor

600
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,100
I'd like to make a motion

601
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,100
To rock this mother out

602
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,100
Your honor

603
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,100
Please don't bang that gavel

604
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,100
You can try this cowbell out

605
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Let's all give a night

606
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,100
To the hardest work

607
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,100
And law here

608
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,100
It's jersey time

609
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,100
Yeah

610
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,100
It's jersey time

611
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,100
Oh yeah

612
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,100
Your honor

613
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,100
What do you say

614
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,100
There you go

615
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,100
How's it going Adam

616
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,100
It's jersey time

617
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,100
The official musicologist of the Chacha

618
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,100
And while I say that I'm your musicologist

619
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,100
After hearing your comments earlier in the week about Sherry Miller

620
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,100
I think what you're really really looking for

621
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,100
Is a pimple

622
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,100
It's actually right

623
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,100
Because I think what you really are looking for me to do

624
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,100
Is go out on the positive music network

625
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,100
And find you some bass

626
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Yeah

627
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
I've done it again for you

628
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,100
In fact, you've had her in the past

629
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,100
Why don't you have her again

630
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,100
Name is Alice from the Alice project

631
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,100
She's got a lot of great tracks up on the PMN

632
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:15,100
In fact, she's one of my all-time favorite female artists

633
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,100
She's got just a great new track up on the PMN

634
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
Which is perfect for a football Friday

635
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
It's I'm having a great day

636
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,100

00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,100
I'm gonna go look into the page on the PMN

642
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,100
Okay, you guys listen to this song

643
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100

I'm walking on water

648
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100

So much love to share

652
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,100
I feel less so high about you

653
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,100
I think I have some sun to share

654
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Keeping down to you with

00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,100
Some kind of island being my head

No one can take this

657
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,100
Feeling away

Now there's something that we kind of started

692
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,100
Was it many, many moons ago

693
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,100
Called the organization for the preservation

00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,100
OPSOL

699
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,100
Wait, let me do this

700
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,100
Oscar Papa Sierra Oscar Lima

701
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,100
Got to stay in practice for flying

702
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,100
Even though I'm not

703
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,100
And so people have been sending in their stories

704
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,100
And their songs

705
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,100
And some of them fit really well

706
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,100
Some of them not so well

707
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,100
And what I don't need is people calling in

708
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,100
With their own stories

709
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,100
She's right at it

710
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,100
Because I want to read it

711
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,100
You've got to all set up and templatize

712
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,100
It should be able to crank out a couple

713
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,100
In fact I did a few

714
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
Was it last Friday

715
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,100
I had to do a whole bunch of productions

716
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,100
So I'm trying to get one week out at least

717
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,100
But these are kind of every green

718
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
Because as you kind of stay at stick around there

719
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
And even though this entry

720
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,100
Was not exactly what I asked for

721
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,100
I just figured I'd play it for you today

722
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
On the football Friday

723
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Because everyone seems to enjoy it when we just kick out the jams

724
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,100
Adam, Prof Ross here

725
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,100
Redondo Beach California

726
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,100
Called Austin

727
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,100
Hey, interesting on 709

728
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,100
I'm a little behind you

729
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,100
We're talking about picturing the record labels

730
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,100
You know as they spun on the 45's vinyl

731
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,100
And just that phrase

732
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
Took me back

733
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,100
Talking about

734
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,100
You know soundtrack of our live

735
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,100
Preservation

736
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,100
Took me back to

737
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,100
Concept Blanca records

738
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,100
It's at outkiss

739
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,100
Donna summer all

740
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,100
Stuff and I can totally picture

741
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,100
Like

742
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,100
The brand new vinyl

743
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,100
Pulling it out

744
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,100
The smell of it

745
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,100
Kind of shrink raft

746
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,100
That tour

747
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,100
And then you're broken it open

748
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,100
Just

749
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,100
Sometimes a little phrase

750
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,100
A little music

751
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,100
Soundcrack of our life

752
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,100
Me and the way

753
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,100
They're down by the school

754
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
Not on our farm

755
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,100
Tonight

756
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:50,100
I want to give it up to you

757
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,100
In the dark night

758
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:57,100
It's so much I want to do

759
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,100
And tonight

760
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,100
I want to let it go to be

761
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,100
Because girl I was made for you

762
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:12,100
And girl you would make for me

763
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,100
I was made for loving you

764
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,100
And you were made for loving me

765
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,100
And I can't get it over

766
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,100
You made it again

767
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,100
You can't get it over me

768
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,100
Tonight

769
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,100
I want to see it go right

770
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:38,100
Feel the magic

771
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,100
There's something that I can find

772
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,100
And tonight

773
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,100
We're going to make it all come true

774
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:53,100
Because girl you would make for me

775
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:57,100
And girl I was made for you

776
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,100
I was made for loving you

777
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,100
And you were made for loving me

778
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,100
And I can't get it over

779
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,100
You made it again

780
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,100
You can't get it over me

781
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,100
I was made for loving you

782
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,100
And I can't get it over me

783
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:24,100
And I can't get it over me

784
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,100
And you can't get it over me

785
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:40,100
And I can't get it over me

786
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:45,100
And I can't get it over me

787
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:49,100
And I can't get it over me

788
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:54,100
And I can't get it over me

789
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:59,100
And I can't get it over me

790
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:04,100
And I can't get it over me

791
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:09,100
And I can't get it over me

792
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:14,100
And I can't get it over me

793
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:18,100
And I can't get it over me

794
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:23,100
And I can't get it over me

795
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,100
And I can't get it over me

796
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,100
And I can't get it over me

797
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,100
Oh yeah, man

798
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,100
Remember where you were?

799
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,100
And that song came out

800
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,100
And I must have been 15, 16

801
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,100
I must have been 15, 16

802
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,100
Going to dances and barns

803
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:51,100
You know, getting my first experience of the opposite sex

804
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,100
And you dance your brains out to this track

805
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,100
And then all you do is you just hope for a really really slow song

806
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:02,100
To come on next so you could get a nice, close and personal

807
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,100
With the girl that you found for the evening

808
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,100
Oh yeah, man

809
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,100
That's a soundtrack to my life

810
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,100
And with me now

811
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,100
43 year old old bastard

812
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,100
Here's the first track

813
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,100
I wish I was cool

814
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,100
I used to be a key

815
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,100
Every day of the week

816
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,100
And something stupid came out

817
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,100
Every time I speak

818
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,100
Every Saturday night

819
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,100
I've known the media if plans

820
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,100
I didn't live on the dead

821
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,100
Played for games again

822
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,100
I was bored like a fool

823
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,100
I wish I was cool

824
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,100
Why was useless in class

825
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,100
So I tried out for sports

826
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,100
Where the chalk's got a kick got a kick

827
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,100
And I can't get my shorts

828
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,100
Still in my town

829
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,100
When my shower was gone

830
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,100
I walked through the window

831
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:44,100
I couldn't find one

832
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,100
I had a street to school

833
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,100
I wish I was cool

834
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:53,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

835
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

836
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,100
Cool

837
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,100
Mama, dear Mama, thank my shorts

838
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,100
I'll come in down

839
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,100
I held my tight to my books

840
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,100
Got my mouth shut in class

841
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,100
And my hammy down closed

842
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,100
Even the teachers would laugh

843
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,100
I prayed to the clock

844
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,100
And I'd eat lunch alone

845
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,100
We haven't even gotten to the box

846
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,100
Right home, no teachers knows

847
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,100
I wish I was cool

848
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,100
Hey

849
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,100
You see, we live in a house

850
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,100
With too many kids

851
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,100
And too many beds

852
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,100
And I'm much fooling the fridge

853
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,100
And the kids on the box

854
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,100
Call it the house

855
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,100
So they hear excuses

856
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,100
Too many cars on the lawn

857
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,100
Been fixed by my dad lost the truth

858
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,100
I wish I was cool

859
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

860
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

861
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

862
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,100
Mama, dear Mama, your broken boy is coming along

863
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:21,100
So right, it's the moral of the story

864
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,100
You say the king and the jacks

865
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,100
Turned out to be gay

866
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,100
And all the little cool kids

867
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,100
They didn't have a small town

868
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,100
Where some used to be nerd

869
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,100
Kibos them around

870
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,100
It's our turn to be cruel

871
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,100
Oh, yeah

872
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:43,100
It's our turn to be cruel

873
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,100
Say it all with me now

874
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,100
I wish I was cool

875
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,100
I wish I was cool

876
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,100
I wish I was cool

877
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,100
I wish I was cool

878
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,100
I wish I was cool

879
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,100
I love it

880
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,100
Jersey Todd, thank you man

881
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,100
Great suggestion, Chris, trapper of the push stars

882
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,100
Which I was cool on this football Friday edition of the Daily Source Code

883
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,100
Hey, where's Roger Smalls

884
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,100
Roger

885
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,100
It's been a while, buddy

886
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,100
Love to hear from you, really wood

887
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,100
I got one more track lined up for you

888
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,100
Another one from the soundtrack of our lives

889
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:18,100
But first, and I told you, you know, now that of course the coverage

890
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,100
The, certainly the mainstream media coverage of the primaries

891
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:26,100
In the United States has, you know, more or less dropped off the crevice

892
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,100
Dropped into the crevice, I should say

893
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,100
Because, of course, it's all over now

894
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,100
Or it's not

895
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,100
You know, we still don't know who's going to be in the Democratic side

896
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:40,100
Maybe, yeah, it could be John McCain on the Republican side

897
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,100
But, Huckabee is still in the race

898
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,100
As is Ron Paul

899
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,100
And Ron Paul has a strategy

900
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,100
And you know, I support him

901
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,100
So I want you to hear it too

902
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,100
Hey Adam, this is Terry from Seattle

903
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,100
Hey

904
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,100
Yeah, I heard you on Wednesday the 719

905
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,100
Yes, the, you were talking about Ron Paul

906
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,100
And now he was losing

907
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:06,100
Oh, let's not get our dober down

908
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,100
He isn't out of this thing yet

909
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:12,100
There's a lot of delegates that are committed

910
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,100
There's a lot of stealth delegates

911
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:19,100
This, this caucus we had in Washington State on Saturday

912
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,100
The party is engineered in McCain

913
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,100
A victory, that's an air quotes

914
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,100
Because you didn't really win

915
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,100
There wasn't really much to win

916
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,100
Nothing's been won yet

917
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,100
That's my point exactly

918
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,100
You know, how they say it in over till the fat lady sings

919
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,100
Well, it ain't over

920
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,100
And not until the convention

921
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,100
When the actual nominee is presented

922
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,100
Anything could happen

923
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,100
You know, I mean, it's a horrible thought

924
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,100
But what if McCain

925
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,100
Could it be president for some reason

926
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,100
Health reasons or anything like that

927
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,100
It's a long time until

928
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,100
Well, in general, it's a long time until November

929
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,100
When we have the general election

930
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:06,100
But we're still away from from the Republican and the Democratic

931
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,100
Conventions

932
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,100
So give it a little time, you know, it's

933
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,100
It's a media has made this into such a frenzy

934
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,100
And everyone thinks they know who won

935
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,100
But they don't really, and I'll tell you, I see people over here

936
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,100
They're confused, they don't get it at all

937
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,100
Because of course, the people who are actually reporting this don't even get it

938
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,100
They just want something cool

939
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,100
Oh, there's a race, let's report on it no matter what it is

940
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,100
Doesn't get decided until

941
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,100
A, the primary, which decides

942
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,100
51% of the delegate

943
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:37,100
And B, the state convention, which yesterday's caucus

944
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,100
Was just the beginning of that

945
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:42,100
And so we'll be going to convention

946
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,100
First we go to the county convention

947
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,100
Where we pick our state delegates

948
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,100
And then we go to the state convention

949
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,100
Where we pick our national delegates

950
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,100
The other 49% for the Republicans

951
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,100
And also, if we have a broken convention

952
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,100
All bets are off then

953
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:02,100
Because people that may be committed to McCain

954
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:06,100
On the, if he doesn't win on the first ballot

955
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,100
On the second ballot, they can vote for whoever they are

956
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,100
So I know there's a lot of wrong policy supporters

957
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,100
That are elected as, we're going to try to get elected as

958
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:18,100
McCain delegates and then hoping for a second ballot

959
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,100
So they can vote for Paul

960
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:23,100
So let's keep up the positive thinking and prayer for wrong policies

961
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,100
Because he's not out of the yet

962
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,100
So please keep pushing

963
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,100
We're going on to, we're going on to the convention

964
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,100
All right, I'm 48

965
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:39,100
I've been listening since February of 2005

966
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,100
And no homo

967
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,100
That's not good

968
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,100
All right, thank you

969
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,100
I also posted a video from Dr. Ron Paul

970
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,100
On at curry.com

971
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,100
I should probably, I tried doing that in the show notes

972
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,100
Pod Show, but it doesn't work for some reason

973
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,100
Maybe the embed code is host or something

974
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:01,100
But he basically is called for a march on Washington

975
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,100
He says, you know, this is really risky

976
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,100
But we've done risky things before

977
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,100
Like, you know, putting the money counter

978
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,100
Right there on the homepage

979
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:14,100
And of course, all of the money bombs have been significantly successful

980
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:19,100
So the risk here, of course, is that you call for a march on Washington

981
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,100
And no one comes

982
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,100
However, if a lot of people come, it could really say something

983
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:31,100
And that too could change the course of who is, who becomes the Republican candidate for the general election

984
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,100
So

985
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,100
I'm keeping my eyes on it doing what I can

986
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,100
And clearly other people are as well

987
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,100
All right

988
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,100
Rollin' out one more from the op-sold libraries

989
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,100
For some reason, I was thinking about these guys in this song

990
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,100
Almost all week and for just now

991
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,100
I kind of humming it back and forth

992
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,100
Talk, talk

993
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,100
It's my life on the football Friday for the Chuck Charlie

994
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:00,100
But it never bothers me

995
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,100
No, I want you

996
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,100
What day?

997
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:15,100
It never could bother me

998
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:19,100
I'm there still no way

999
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:26,100
On the very front door

1000
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,100
All you've asked was so

1001
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:37,100
How much do I do?

1002
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,080
Can we ask just a

1003
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,100
It's my life

1004
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:58,100
Don't give more time, it's the life, it's the love of you

1005
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:11,100
Don't give more time, it's the life, it's the love of you

1006
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:26,100
Don't give more time, it's the life, it's the love of you

1007
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:39,100
If I were sometimes played apart, I'd raise to love

1008
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:46,100
I tell myself, what can we do now?

1009
00:52:46,100 --> 00:53:07,100
Children's myself, it's the life, don't give more time, it's the life, it's the love of you

1010
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:32,100
Don't give more time, it's the life, it's the love of you

1011
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:39,100
Oh, that's myself, how was the year?

1012
00:53:39,100 --> 00:54:01,100
Can we choose him? It's the love, don't give more time, it's the life, it's the life

1013
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:13,100
Don't give more time, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's the soundtrack to my life

1014
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:19,100
and all that goodness, sorry for the extraneous audio that's crept in there

1015
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:23,100
and now I've got the Vorac technique to send me text messages saying

1016
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:26,100
Hey dude, let's do the show because you can be packing over the weekend

1017
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,100
since you're flying out Monday.

1018
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:32,100
So maybe I will, you'll have a lot of stuff to listen to today and tomorrow

1019
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:37,100
and of course if you're living down under in Australia, or if you're New Zealand, it'll be about Wednesday

1020
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,100
by the time you get all of this.

1021
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,100
What's the idea today?

1022
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,100
There it is.

1023
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:44,100
It's Friday, Monday Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Thursday, Friday

1024
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:47,100
and a spinal fund for the week.

1025
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:54,100
Yeah, well, I guess the only final thought I can have is wake up people, wake up

1026
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,100
We've got to do something.

1027
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:03,100
And you know what, just by realizing what is going on and then you really should do something

1028
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,100
you're already awakening.

1029
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:09,100
That means the red pill is taking hold and that's a very good thing.

1030
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:13,100
So, mull it over this weekend, then I'll be back next week from San Francisco

1031
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:18,100
coming to you from the curry condo, of course, and we'll talk about some civil disobedience

1032
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,100
shall we?

1033
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,100
We'll be really fine.

1034
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,100
Oh, man.

1035
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,100
Yeah, that's really the only thought I have.

1036
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,100
It's just running through my brain continuously.

1037
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,100
I can't help myself.

1038
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:33,100
But meanwhile, don't forget to stop sniffing all the flowers once in a while.

1039
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,100
If you're in the UK, we've got like what looks like an early spring.

1040
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:40,100
So, plenty of flowers to be sniffed and birds to be heard singing.

1041
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,100
So make sure you do that as well.

1042
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,100
Yeah, that's good enough for a final thought of the week.

1043
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:58,100
So, it's adamantpodshow.com, dailysourceco.com, for all the show notes, live your life with passion

1044
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:01,100
and while at last, enjoy your freedom.

1045
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:04,100
Another pod show podcast, stick it in your ear.
