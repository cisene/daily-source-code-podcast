00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hey, I'm a media guy, and I know how television works.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You know, I've been a part of the machine, it is one big.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's a flickering fucking box, okay?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's a light box, and people are tuned into this thing that jacked in.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So deeply, I see how it affects very rational people,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
how they really believe things.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And this is carried over to the internet.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I see, you know, I watch all of these loose-change 9-11.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You know, every single, I watch them.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But I can see all the pieces to it,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and I can take away and I can analyze that and still keep some sanity.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But, you know, other people, they don't have that capability.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
They have not been able to switch that off.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So that's why they get sucked very deeply into these types of stories,

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
which people forget that it's just people right in shit.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
They can't think of themselves.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
They can't think straight. They're jacked into the matrix.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So we're here getting ready for the big gala that will be the DSC 750.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, look over there, there's Jersey Todd ensuring that the stage is safe for the bands that will be playing.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Guess he doesn't want any new clients.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But look over there, his CSBN Rodgers small.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What a pair they make talking together, looks like it's getting a little heated.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We better move on.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, that there's P-Dub.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Telling some stories to some listeners.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's see, see Chapman.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Mark Usherwood and him call them Marcus Couch taking in the great stories by the satellite repairman and so on.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, over there's the room of girls and Angie B.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And don't quite recognize that other lady with them.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, wait, she's turning around.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, it's the nylon.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, Mark.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, he is the man of the hour.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Mr. Adam Curry.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's see if we can get a moment with him.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Adam?

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Could you say something to our listeners getting ready to participate in the DSC 750 celebrations?

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, awesome.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I think it ends.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, so we should probably, all right.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I got to think about this.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You already here.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm getting diarrhea of the mouth.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Gee, thank you, Adam.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's a very nice.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What is 750 anyway?

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's three cores of the way to a thousand.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
One with the show.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh, $16 billion worth of airplane straps by us.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
To the next generation radio caught any of my ears.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We don't need no digging through the end.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I like to think I'm sorry.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You should be sure.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I guess it's angry.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But you are all going to make a big noise.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Pain in the street.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't know if you'll be a great matchup.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And you got mud on your face.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You'll make this great.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Kicking your trend all over the face.

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Picking the face.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We will roll you.

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We will roll you again.

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But you are a young man.

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm actually in the street.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't know what's up.

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You got blood on your face.

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You'll make this great.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Wave in your power.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Picking your trend.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We will roll you.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We will roll you again.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We will roll you again.

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But you are a normal man.

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Poor man.

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You knew you'd rise.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Got a big smile.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Be something.

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You got mud on your face.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000

We will rock you in the

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
more clean ACVC wrapped up in the matchup. Thanks to Dr. Art from mashuptown.com for

145
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
sourcing and specifically for the Charlie. Everybody how you doing? How are you?

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's Adam your buddy. Here in the Curry condo. It's Wednesday the 23rd of April 2008

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and haven't done any shows up until today because as you know, I split pretty quickly

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
last week from London off to San Francisco and lots of stuff happening here at HQ which of course

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
is part of the reason why I'm here. You probably noticed that today it's no longer pod show.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's mevio.com. So that's the first important change that has been made and there's a lot of cool stuff

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,000
of coming around this time actually. I believe mevio.com should be up and the crew is pushing out

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
a whole bunch of changes and features. Oh man, the list is pretty endless. You should see them pretty

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
quickly. Some of the big ones of course are embedding of shows. That's under our sharing

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
features. We have more options to put shows. I mean, this is all kinds. By the way, I really

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
want to tell you how awesome. As an entrepreneur, having a business, there are many beautiful

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
moments in a company's lifespan. Right now, we are in one of those moments where the team

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
is really together. We're all bonded. We hang out last night. Everyone worked pretty well.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I think some people were actually through the night. All in an effort to get this up because

159
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
the run and I did a lot of press. Of course, our producer group, which also, by the way,

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
awesome bunch of people who all participated in the conversation about the name change

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and are working with this rebranding. It's just beautiful when everything starts to come together

162
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and I'm really, really happy, really proud. I want to thank everybody who's been working so hard

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
on making this work. Why the name change? Well, quite frankly, having the word pod in

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
our name was hurting our business and not really on the audience side, although we'll see

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the proof is in the pudding if that'll make any difference. But certainly on the advertising

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
side. I'll just give you one example, but this is really the main reason why we change

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
our name is you look at a media buyer. They have a plan for their client. We do a lot of

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
direct client work as well, but a lot of it goes through media buying agencies. And

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
inevitably, or invariably, I should say, there's adjustments to a budget and the first

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
thing to be reduced or chopped off all together is always something that has the word

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
pod in it because it's difficult for the media agency to explain it to the client.

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
There's this negative connotation, which I can't do anything about, although my goodness

173
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I have tried, pod casting brings with it some kind of stigma of people sitting in

174
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
their basement with a microphone, which, by the way, is awesome content often, okay? So

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
there's no problem with that. I have no problem with it. But when it's hurting business,

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
that's when we got to change things. So we have a brand new senior vice president of

177
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
sales, Chris Little, who came over to us from Dakota, which is now, that's a behavioral

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
marketing firm that I think was sold to American online. And Chris has really been

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
kicking ass and he's doing great stuff for us. And he has a vision. He has a vision of

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
some really big stuff, which fits in perfectly with our big stuff vision. So

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
couldn't be happier. And of course, here I am talking into a microphone, not in my

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
basement, but close enough to it in the Curry condo here in No Cal. Got a lot of

183
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
stuff to get through today since I've been short on shows this week. And I got a lot of

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
cool comments, particularly this first one, as our buddy who should have a

185
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
jingle, he being pretty much a Savanti's days with the amount of air

186
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
time he's getting the Arjuna. Make it in New York, calls up with an invitation

187
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
which is a very hard offer to refuse. Mr. Curry,

188
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Jamaican in New York here. First of all, let me congratulate you on the

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
DSC 750. Thank you. That's a lot of shows. It's a commendable man.

190
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's amazing. Thank you. Thank you for all the shows.

191
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And all the time you put in. I appreciate it. We all appreciate it.

192
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And by the way, let me just reiterate you guys actually put the show together.

193
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Every single time I sit down to do my show prep. I'm looking at the stuff you

194
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
dropped on the DSC drop at drop.io slash daily source code. I'm looking at my emails.

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
By the way, I fixed Curry dot com in case you hadn't noticed. If you sent an email

196
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
to Adam at Curry dot com, that's working again. Finally, I finally took the

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
time and just sit down and make it happen. And it actually didn't take that long.

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And I can't believe it took me so long to get that fixed.

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But also these comments, man, the voice mail is the stuff that you guys send in.

200
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I love it. Thank you for helping me get through 750 episodes.

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And let's do at least 250 more.

202
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But I want to tell you a little story about what happened to me over the weekend.

203
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You know, you've been saying every springtime in the summer.

204
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You know, how it gets warm and unlawed and becomes beautiful. You see

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
you see boobs everywhere. Those kind of things.

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah, apparently New York is a lot like like London.

207
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Ah, this is something that I noticed.

208
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I haven't been in the UK for a while now in the springtime and in summer.

209
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The women in London. Oh, man. They are so sexy.

210
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
They're all walking around and short mini skirts and tight tops and just

211
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
everything popping out. And it's just as a guy.

212
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's a wonderful, wonderful time of year.

213
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I had better than Christmas even.

214
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You know, this is my first spring. My first spring in New York.

215
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And you know, I figure, man, let me go to Central Park tomorrow.

216
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
One day on Saturday, you know, people must be in the parks.

217
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
First time going to the park.

218
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And let me tell you what I saw.

219
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't, I saw people laying down bathing suits.

220
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't know where I am.

221
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Having lived in New York, I know.

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I know how people treat Central Park in the spring and in the summertime.

223
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
They treat it like a beach. I know.

224
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But it's not quite the same thing.

225
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm thinking to myself, man, Adam would love this.

226
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I would love this.

227
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Adam needs to come join me in New York.

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And sit on the great lawn would be on it.

229
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And then just enjoy the sights.

230
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Watch the people throw it free.

231
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And jump in a row and clean.

232
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You know, Adam, when you come into New York when we can,

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
we can chill out in Central Park.

234
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But tomorrow, no.

235
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's here for you, man.

236
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Just, we can just bring a brew on.

237
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And let's do it.

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah.

239
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Jimmy, can you New York?

240
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't.

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I love you.

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah, I don't.

243
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You had me up until brew.

244
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I was thinking something else that the Jamaican in New York

245
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
had hooked me up with.

246
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But, uh, I wouldn't have been nice.

247
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah, you'll find me in New York.

248
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Jamaica in New York.

249
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Ginny.

250
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Let's call him Ginny.

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Jamaican in New York.

252
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Ginny.

253
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The Ginny survived.

254
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah, you'll see me, man.

255
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Plenty of business to be done.

256
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And I love New York.

257
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I can't say that enough.

258
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I fact was just talking about it today with the, with the

259
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Opscrew.

260
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And, uh, I say, you know, every single time in New York,

261
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
it just, I call Patricia and I just say,

262
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'll, you know, it feels, like home, you know,

263
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
it just feels really good.

264
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And now that I have a friend like Jamaica in New York,

265
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
it's going to feel even better.

266
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Speaking of the lady pee, lots of, uh,

267
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
comments on, um, I think it was, uh,

268
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
was it source code 748, where we discovered together

269
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
that she's indeed quite dyslexic.

270
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And boy, did I get a lot of comments on that?

271
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Hey, Adam, this is Carolyn Colorado.

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You were talking about the, uh,

273
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
difficulty of driving directions with dyslexia.

274
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And I wanted to relate to you an interesting story.

275
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Um, I grew up in the U.S.

276
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and when I lived in Australia for a couple of years,

277
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I had a very strange occurrence where I was given my wife

278
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
directions and told her to turn right while I was pointing to the left.

279
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Um, I was very interesting occurrence.

280
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Um, my theory was that it's because in the U.S.

281
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
we learned that the near turn is right and the far turn is left

282
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
when, uh, of course, that's, um,

283
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
reverse for people that drive on the right on the left side of the street.

284
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You know, that's something we didn't discuss because you,

285
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I think you're on to something here because of course,

286
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
we're used to, uh, sitting in the left hand side of the car

287
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and driving in the right hand side of the road.

288
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Uh, now obviously we're kind of used to driving on the left hand side

289
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
of the road sitting in the right hand seat of the car.

290
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
By the way, I fly the airplane in the left hand seat

291
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and the helicopter in the right hand seat.

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So yeah, you can see working at kind of confusing.

293
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So, um, that was very strange.

294
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I also ran into many occurrences where we would mix up east

295
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and west, um, relative to north and south.

296
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Uh, that was very strange.

297
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Even to the point where I would get convinced that the points

298
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
of the compass were reversed.

299
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Uh-huh.

300
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Trust your people to figure out whether that was due to being

301
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
in the southern hemisphere or just being unfamiliar with the, uh,

302
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
territory, not sure.

303
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So anyway, um, I don't chalk this up to dyslexia

304
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
because I've never really had a problem with that.

305
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But, uh, when you're driving,

306
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
there's other weird things that go on in your mind.

307
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Um, take care.

308
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Uh, 53, uh, no hair left, uh, two kids.

309
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Uh, whatever blah, blah, blah, blah.

310
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Take care.

311
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Thank you.

312
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah.

313
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So, um, the trick for a west and east, uh,

314
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
which, uh, even I sometimes have to think about,

315
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
you know, I use the compass a lot, obviously, uh, with flying.

316
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And all you have to remember is that, uh,

317
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
it's always west on the left, east on the right,

318
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
if north is up.

319
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And then, because that spells we.

320
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And otherwise it would be,

321
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
ooh.

322
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And that's not really a word.

323
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And I still catch myself using that.

324
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
A lot of people call them with this, uh,

325
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
with the following, uh,

326
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
little, uh, little trick for the lady P.

327
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And for anyone who has trouble.

328
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And by the way, don't be ashamed if you,

329
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
uh, if you get confused between your left and right hand,

330
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
because apparently a lot of people have this issue.

331
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Uh, so this might be helpful for you as well.

332
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I had him as Parkie checking in with a top tip for the lady P.

333
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah.

334
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
She's getting confused with the left hand and a right hand.

335
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'll ask her to put her,

336
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
both her hands facing down,

337
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
so the palm is facing down on the top of the hand is facing up.

338
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah.

339
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And then if you extend her thumbs inwards,

340
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
the left hand one will make a lovely else.

341
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, yes.

342
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
How about that?

343
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's nice and easy to remember.

344
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So, both palms facing down,

345
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
thumbs facing inwards.

346
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Lift it up and you go a lovely L on the left hand.

347
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'll keep it up to it.

348
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
See you later.

349
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I like it.

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah.

351
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And you're more of those.

352
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Hey, I saw somewhere I was on Twitter on email,

353
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
the parking that your house got burglared.

354
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Is that true, man?

355
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That that sucks ass.

356
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
If it is, I'm really sorry that that happened.

357
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Parkie has been sending me all kinds of awesome financial stuff.

358
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Uh, so he's, uh, he's kind of a hidden sabond here of the Charlie.

359
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But yeah, a lot of people sent in, uh,

360
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
sent in that tip, uh, the top tip, just by holding your hands,

361
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
palms down in front of you, um,

362
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
the hand that makes a lovely L with the, uh,

363
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
four finger in the thumb is your left hand.

364
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
There you go.

365
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's not all that hard.

366
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And we love the lady Patricia regardless, don't we?

367
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, we do.

368
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Hey, I'm Mrs. Schmall from not so sunny,

369
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I knew this morning.

370
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I just don't really call that much.

371
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I actually, it's the first time I call,

372
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I sent a few emails.

373
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But I thought I would shoot, uh,

374
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
leave a voicemail to tell you that last year was, uh,

375
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
that was BFC 748, where the late Patricia was in.

376
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I thought it was wonderful.

377
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's been listening for two years,

378
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and that was probably the best show to me,

379
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
as so much fun.

380
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And hopefully we will get her back online.

381
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
All right.

382
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Thank you, Adam.

383
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And I'll talk to you soon.

384
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
My friend, thank you.

385
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah.

386
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Have you really been listening for two years?

387
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Because no sign off.

388
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I get no big hair, I hope you win.

389
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Okay.

390
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's all right.

391
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'll let you slide for this time.

392
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah.

393
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
We all love the lady Patricia.

394
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And, uh,

395
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I know it works, man.

396
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Whenever she's on the show,

397
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
and whenever we just talk the way we talk normally,

398
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
the show is always awesome.

399
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And of course, we'll have her on.

400
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Uh, but she's busy.

401
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You know, she's, uh, she's cranked up her career,

402
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
man.

403
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
She's doing all kinds of stuff.

404
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Next week when I'm back in Blighty,

405
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I think Thursday,

406
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
the two of us are going over to the Netherlands.

407
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm going to go with her.

408
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
She's doing a talk show.

409
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Very famous one that we've been on together before.

410
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So we're going to be on that Thursday night.

411
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And of course, she's promoting her,

412
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
her first live show in the series of Holland's Got Talent,

413
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
which kicks off Friday night.

414
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And of course, I'm going to be there for that as well.

415
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So we'll be together.

416
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
We'll be having fun.

417
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And we'll be having a crazy monkey sex in the hotel,

418
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
which I'm looking forward to.

419
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
This past Saturday was a very special date.

420
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It was the 20th of April, 2008.

421
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And for those in the know,

422
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
the date four and two zero four,

423
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
20 is quite significant amongst the stoners.

424
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And I know who you are out there.

425
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
We've made this two way.

426
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I can see you.

427
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And a couple of people called in,

428
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
because it's kind of like a ritual amongst people

429
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
who indulge from time to time in the holy herb.

430
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
They wish them a happy 420.

431
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And I think the 420, it was either a police code

432
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
or I can't remember where it came from.

433
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There's a story behind it.

434
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm sure someone will call it and tell me all about it.

435
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And we'll keep that for next year.

436
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But this is a quintessential example of a fort.

437
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Someone calling in to wish me a happy 420.

438
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This is a.

439
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Okay.

440
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Hold on a second here.

441
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Something is fired.

442
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Ah, it happens to the best of us.

443
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Doesn't it?

444
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
All right.

445
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Here it comes.

446
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Adam.

447
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That be 420.

448
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Oh.

449
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So I had a thought that I wanted to share with the world.

450
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And crap.

451
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Now that I'm on the message.

452
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
They got in my mind with a thought to share with the world.

453
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't remember what that thought was.

454
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So I'm going to have to.

455
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
But it's quick a little bit.

456
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah.

457
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And call us call.

458
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
How's fun?

459
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah.

460
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
420.

461
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yes.

462
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
All right.

463
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Happy 420.

464
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You as a girl, my friend.

465
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I.

466
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I.

467
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes.

468
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I remember when we yesterday have protests songs.

469
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But we actually said something to song.

470
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I was reminded of that on the DSC drop.

471
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
His artist against apartheid.

472
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Oh.

473
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Oh.

474
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh.

475
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh.

476
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh.

477
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh.

478
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh.

479
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Oh.

480
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Oh.

481
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Oh.

482
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh.

483
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Oh.

484
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Oh.

485
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh.

486
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Oh.

487
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Oh.

488
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Oh.

489
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Oh.

490
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh.

491
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Oh.

492
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Oh.

493
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh.

494
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh.

495
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Oh.

496
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Oh.

497
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Oh.

498
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh.

499
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Oh.

500
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh.

501
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Oh.

502
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh.

503
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Oh.

504
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Oh.

505
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh.

506
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh.

507
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Oh.

508
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Oh.

509
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Oh.

510
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh.

511
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Oh.

512
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Oh.

513
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Oh.

514
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Oh.

515
00:22:43,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

516
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:37,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, holy everything ain't in it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Joey was cutting back after his thud, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, had to say something, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, left behind and just now, you know what I was doing

517
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,500
I thought it was something to say

518
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,500
I thought it was something to say

519
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,500
I thought it was something to say

520
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,500
I thought it was something to say

521
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,500
I thought it was something to say

522
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,500
I thought it was something to say

523
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:09,500
I thought it was something to say

524
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,500
I thought that I was something to say

525
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,500
I love it's gross. It's gross

526
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,500
But I will understand that

527
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,500
I guess I need the word

528
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,500
No we fall, no homeguards

529
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:32,500
I thought I would buy somebody

530
00:24:32,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

531
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:26,880
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah what are we singing?

532
00:25:32,500 --> 00:26:02,500
We will hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear

533
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:32,500
we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, I will hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you I, we'll hear you, we'll hear you, we'll hear you,

534
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,500
It's a part-time completely over.

535
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,500
I don't know, I'm just asking, you know.

536
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:46,380
Great suggestion, by the way, that came in through the daily source code drop.io slash daily source

537
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,380
code.

538
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,980
Great place to upload ideas, clips, things you just call it.

539
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,460
It also has a voicemail number, by the way.

540
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:58,460
It's a voice line, you can call it and it'll automatically post it into the drop.

541
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,460
All kinds of cool stuff there.

542
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,100
It's, of course, was the, uh, wasn't like the 12 inch version, so a little bit too long

543
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,700
even for the Charlie, because just kind of drones on after a while.

544
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,700
And I do have, uh, a number of, um, number of things that I found here and there that I

545
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
wanted to talk about.

546
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:18,380
First of all, how about that euro, huh?

547
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:22,620
It's not like I didn't say, uh, and I think I'm on record somewhere that this is really

548
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:29,420
out of control, the euro now passed one dollar and 60 cents for one euro and

549
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:35,060
I'm telling you, I have a feeling, by the end of this year, this thing could go to $2.

550
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:40,020
We just might see a $2 euro, which, of course, will mean that the oil per barrel will

551
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:45,700
be somewhere, somewhere around $200, if not more.

552
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,700
And I've predicted something pretty close to this before, and I think, uh, I think I just

553
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,380
might, might be right.

554
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:57,100
And, uh, well, for more of this, uh, I refer to, uh, Noah Jen, I'm sure that, uh, John C.

555
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,980
to work, and I will have, um, more conversations about, uh, the state of the, uh, financial

556
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,100
or the financial status of the world, anything that we'd, I'll tell you, things are bad

557
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,980
when you are on sand hill road, which is a very famous, uh, here in Silicon Valley, it's

558
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,180
where all the big, uh, venture capital firms are.

559
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:19,360
And, uh, just today, uh, an investor told me, he said, you know, man, it's really getting

560
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
out of control.

561
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:26,500
I'm flying commercial to Europe, instead of taking the golf stream, it's just so expensive,

562
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,940
the fuel cost in Europe, and all you have to pay these euro control fees, and, oh, no,

563
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,940
work flying commercial.

564
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,940
I thought that was quite a sign of the times, uh, pretty funny.

565
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:42,540
You know, um, uh, our fridge went on the blank two weeks ago, and, uh, because of, you

566
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,820
know, we have a special size and has to fit into this, uh, specific dimensions of the cabin

567
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,820
in the kitchen.

568
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:52,180
We had to wait for a week until, um, until we got a new fridge.

569
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,100
And I think I, I think I told you about this, right?

570
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,620
And, uh, so it's finally arrived and, uh, and boy, we had a party that was really nice,

571
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:06,100
but when the guys delivered the fridge, uh, excuse me, I had to move, uh, the Twingo,

572
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,420
because, you know, now, of course, we have three cars in the driveway, like we need that,

573
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,420
right?

574
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,180
So the Twingo had to be moved off to the side a little bit, and so I went outside to

575
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,820
move the car.

576
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,620
And, uh, so these, you know, two guys like delivery dudes, right there, they're kind

577
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,620
of standing up.

578
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,620
Not too far from me.

579
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,380
A little bit higher, there's a plateau before you go into the front door of the house.

580
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,620
And I smelled something in the air.

581
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,020
I'm like, man, am I just standing down, wind for these guys?

582
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,540
Because they smell like shit.

583
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,860
I mean, honestly, I was like, oh, man, I hope they don't smell this and hope, and think

584
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:43,900
it's me, you know, but the wind was literally blowing, um, from their direction, like, man,

585
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,460
these guys, they're, they're rancid.

586
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,220
They've been out delivering, uh, refrigerators all day.

587
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:55,900
And, uh, now these reports are starting to surface, which makes total sense because I thought

588
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:00,900
I recognized this smell, and it wasn't something that I'd smell them myself before.

589
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:07,140
Here's, uh, from CNN.com, a foul smelling permeating London and parts of England over

590
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:13,620
the past two days is due to farmers on the European continent spreading manure in their fields.

591
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:19,620
And it's true, we had a very strong Easterly wind for the past, uh, about a week or so.

592
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,180
Anyway, between 20 and 35 knots, a really strong wind.

593
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,780
And that means it's, if you remember now, we, right?

594
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:30,900
We have the United Kingdom is to the left of, uh, continental hearth.

595
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,860
So the east would be, uh, the continent and the poops smell was just coming across and

596
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:40,580
boy, it really was a stench and I have to say, typically we have the wind coming from the

597
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,580
southwest.

598
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:46,420
That was really funny to see this combination of events in combination with the fridge

599
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,820
being on a blink and me immediately thinking that this guy was just ripping a couple, uh,

600
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,660
right in front of me.

601
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:57,060
Now combine that with this news from, uh, from the Fox network and, uh, gentlemen, you'll

602
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:01,340
be, uh, particularly people listening, guys listening to the chucklehead who are chuckleheads

603
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,980
listening to the Charlie will be very happy to hear this news report, men who frequently

604
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:11,140
masturbate appear to have a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.

605
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:16,020
This is according to Australian researchers from the cancer council of Victoria and

606
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,220
indeed to found the men who masturbated more than five times each week were one third

607
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,340
less likely to develop the cancer of the prostate.

608
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,540
And as some technical details, the study surveyed 1000 men who developed prostate cancer

609
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:34,220
and 1,250 who did not and all were between the ages of 20 and 50 according to report,

610
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,220
came out Monday.

611
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,140
And this was actually this reporter originally originated from the, uh, from planet

612
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:44,340
out, uh, what they're calling here, the gay and lesbian news site.

613
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:48,220
Researchers told the BBC last week the prostate produces one of the fluids involved in

614
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:53,220
ejaculation and that frequent masturbation appears to flush out carcinogens.

615
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:58,660
Well, well, well, how are we feeling about that?

616
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,260
To say five times a week.

617
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,260
Okay.

618
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,300
So I think this needs to be a part of the new sign-off.

619
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,300
Love you, mean it.

620
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,300
Great hair.

621
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Hope you win.

622
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,820
Are you a five timer?

623
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,820
Five times a week?

624
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,820
Be honest.

625
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,820
Include it.

626
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,820
You're sign-off, please.

627
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,820
Analogy.

628
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,820
Great.

629
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,860
Now you can watch movies and TV shows anywhere you want on devices.

630
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,540
You can hold in your hand.

631
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,340
But not on a show full.

632
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:28,660
And what if you're driving or just walking down the street?

633
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,300
Who who are vision impaired always have to try to enjoy visual media without looking

634
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,300
at it?

635
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,140
Sometimes they can help from something called audio description.

636
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,140
Which turns this.

637
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,140
It's amazing.

638
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,140
Into this.

639
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,140
It's amazing.

640
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,140
But the story of punches, Joe drives Gilbert across the ring.

641
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:57,420
He keeps connecting, pinning Gilbert in the corner, making a movie, into an audiobook.

642
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,420
He reads a letter.

643
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,020
He's writing to a district attorney.

644
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:05,260
Dear Sir, my wife and close friend, who is also my physician, are planning to kill

645
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,260
me.

646
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,100
He was in love with her before I met her.

647
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,140
Check out movies for the blind.

648
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,180
A weekly podcast of great public domain movies from the internet archive.

649
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,980
And you can enjoy them without looking at a screen.

650
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,980
Moviesfortheblind.com.

651
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,980
Excellent.

652
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,980
Excellent.

653
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,980
Great initiative.

654
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,980
And of course, you can also go to podshowpress.com.

655
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
That will probably change.

656
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,220
By the way, all of the links, all the email addresses, podshow, obviously, that's going

657
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,220
to stay.

658
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,780
We're not going to break anything.

659
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,220
Just get used to saying, mevio.

660
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,780
And Mark and him often, I've been talking about this.

661
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,540
He's going to think about the name, if you want to.

662
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,540
I said, I'm fine.

663
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,380
If you want to keep it podshowpress, if you want to make it meviopress, if you want

664
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,740
to make it some other name, I'm totally happy with that.

665
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,060
The point is if you want some great audio content.

666
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:54,540
If you want great stories, original stories by fantastic brand new authors who are part of

667
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,540
the new media revolution, go to podshowpress.com.

668
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,140
You will not be disappointed.

669
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:06,060
And I received a really, man, if all clients were like this, many of you probably know

670
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,540
that Luke the Candyman works for Nokia.

671
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,540
He's a Dutchman.

672
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:16,540
He lives in Finland, and we work with him to create the Nokia N810 Internet Tablet

673
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:22,620
Promotion and Campaign across the network.

674
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,980
The campaign ended on April 15th.

675
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,300
He called in, and he gave some stats.

676
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,300
Just listen to this.

677
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:35,340
Now, remember, yes, he's someone who we talk to, and he does his own show with a comic strip

678
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:41,220
blogger called YoAjenda, a little plug there, which is kind of an answer show to know

679
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,220
agenda.

680
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,220
But he's also a client.

681
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,220
And it's really lovely when you receive something like this from a client.

682
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,220
Hello, Adam.

683
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,820
It's the Candyman here.

684
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,980
You know that the last couple of months when people have been signing off their audio

685
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:00,380
come and comments, they have been hoping that you would win, hope you win and all that stuff.

686
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:08,060
So I now receive the final results of the Nokia N810 Potshow Promotion campaign.

687
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:12,180
And let's have a look whether you actually did win, shall we?

688
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:18,540
Of course, for all I want to thank everybody who went out and bought an N810 using one

689
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,180
of the Potshow Promotion codes.

690
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,420
I think that's a great thing, and I really hope they enjoy using the N810 and that it

691
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:31,420
adds something to their day-to-day internet, use it, or media experience.

692
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,420
There you go.

693
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:37,940
So let's look at the top three of the big selling shows during the N810 campaign.

694
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:45,060
On number three, our favorite tech goddess Kelly Lewis with Geek Rift TV.

695
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,940
In second place, and sorry, Adam, but that means you didn't win.

696
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:54,220
So in second place, Adam Curry with the Daily Source Code.

697
00:35:54,220 --> 00:36:02,060
And on number one, my new hero, he's my BFF, new BFF of the Candyman, the sales monster

698
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,660
of the Potshow Network, Marcus Couch from the scenes scene.

699
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,660
Go, Marcus.

700
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:11,820
I mean, he completely destroyed the competition with his sales numbers, it was a hold on a second

701
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,820
look.

702
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,820
There's no competition, dude.

703
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,260
We all sit together in groups and we talk about the best way to do this, it's no competition.

704
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,260
It's co-optician.

705
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,940
We love working together, and I couldn't be happier for Marcus.

706
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:27,100
It was really a very, very good achievement, so I advise everybody to check out this show

707
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,780
at the scenes scenes.com.

708
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:36,580
In terms of countries where we ran the promotions, at the top three was not unexpectedly

709
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:43,620
perhaps, it was number one USA, number two Canada, and number three, the UK.

710
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:50,380
And Belchia, no punta, no chic, zero, unfortunately, but well, it happens.

711
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:56,020
So thanks again, everybody, for joining in, and Adam, I really do hope that next time.

712
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:01,340
You win, because you still have great hair, and we all love you very, very daily.

713
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,340
Bye-bye.

714
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,340
Thank you, man.

715
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,340
Candyman, everybody.

716
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,340
Thank you so much.

717
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:12,220
Thank you, and the fine folks at Nokia for making that promotion available to the

718
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:18,260
mevio, I remember to the mevio audience, making that available, and I think it's certainly

719
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,780
a lot of people will enjoy it.

720
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:25,620
I enjoy my tablet every single day, particularly using gizmo, I love using it on the tablet,

721
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,220
really good implementation.

722
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,700
Okay, let's see, why can do a couple of things here?

723
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,980
I taught you, I'm just going to run a little bit long today, because I really want to

724
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:40,020
get through all the stuff that have lined up, oh, by the way, talking about the surveillance

725
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,020
state.

726
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:49,020
You've got to check out this website, bluetoothtracking.org.

727
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:54,260
It's initiated from the Netherlands, I believe, but it's spreading out to other cities,

728
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,660
and I haven't looked through everything, but you can probably sign up and create your own

729
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,660
bluetooth tracker.

730
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:06,660
But they're literally tracking bluetooth signals, and it's really interesting, because

731
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,180
first of all, the names that people name their phones and subsequently that shows up

732
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,980
as your bluetooth name, those are pretty trippy, but also, you know, they're seeing where

733
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:21,180
people were, and I'm not quite sure if there's a great application for this, but something

734
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,180
went off of my brain.

735
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,180
I'm like, this is interesting.

736
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,620
We've got to keep our eye on that, so make sure you keep checking that.

737
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:30,100
And here's a savant who doesn't have a jingle, but should have one is tray or monetary

738
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,100
scientist checking in.

739
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Hi, Anna.

740
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:38,100
This is tray, the monetary scientist of the Charlie with Run to Go.com, I've been traveling

741
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:44,500
and it wasn't Washington at Data's Conference, TA.org, where to talk about the central

742
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,540
link in the situation of the gold market.

743
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:54,660
Anyways, I'd like to respond to nylon's arguments about, and VSC-747, where it says to

744
00:38:54,660 --> 00:39:00,260
get off the pad, that we've had 15 years of growth and everybody's better off, but always

745
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:05,060
have corrections, they go up and down and come back and forth, whatever, and then that we

746
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:13,260
don't have a gold standard, that says when first is argument that we've had 15 years

747
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,260
of growth.

748
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:20,660
Well, in 1994, Alan Greenspan said that central banks generated a lease and gold to the

749
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,660
price rise.

750
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:27,060
Central banks have been manipulating in the gold market since 1994, these 15 years

751
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:34,620
have had the prosperity has been tick-tissious capital, and we aren't really better off

752
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:39,620
because we've been consuming our capital instead of actually producing anything.

753
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:46,260
And go back and measure your net worth or your salaries in terms of gold, and we'll see

754
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,100
this stuff better off who really are.

755
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,780
I just want to say two things, one, what a point you make there tray.

756
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:56,020
We've been consuming our capital, that is a fantastic point, I really love that.

757
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:01,740
And the other thing I just noticed, you and John C. Dvorak both say, measure, where I say

758
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:07,700
measure, and I'm sure measure is the proper pronunciation, I just thought that's interesting.

759
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,860
The two people I respect and finance, or at least some of their visions and finance,

760
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:16,260
both say, measure, hmm, things that make you go, hmm.

761
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:22,420
And as far as they're always being corrections, well, because it said causes it, if we had

762
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,580
essentially planned egg commission that determined how many eggs everybody got at work

763
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:32,180
price, whatever really screwed up egg market, so likewise, the Fed determines the quantity

764
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:37,060
of money and the cost of money, and because it's central to plan and the market doesn't

765
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:42,340
decide it, there are these huge misallications of capital, cause of business cycle, it's

766
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,340
all the fedsfall.

767
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:49,540
And as far as not having a gold standard, well, it's true, in 1971 we did go off the gold standard,

768
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:53,140
but that doesn't mean that the financial world didn't go off the gold standard, it just

769
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:58,820
means that the dollar and gold dealings from each other, and, you know, I kind of agree with Isaac

770
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:04,100
Newton, who had been at the gold standard, because I believe that the earth, the U.S. dollar

771
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,860
revolves around the sun, which is gold.

772
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:15,140
Anyway, love your hair, keep up the good work, and keep fine for freedom, because that's

773
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:22,820
great. Oh, and by the way, gold is what keeps us free. So, run the gold buddy, back to you later.

774
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:32,020
Hi, Tray. Thank you so much. Gold keeps us free, huh? I have some gold. I, uh, I was advice to

775
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:40,580
buy some gold. It's an evolved. I can go look at it if I want. Oh, yeah. So what I didn't get

776
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:47,460
around to, uh, on the last no agenda with, uh, with John is, uh, he's talking about what Gordon Brown

777
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:54,660
has now done. Um, he's, uh, that's crazy. Man, what's happening. We're getting screwed. At least

778
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:59,940
people who pay taxes in the U.K. Like me, I want to point out, getting screwed. Our, our tax

779
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,940
pounds are now going to be used as a guarantee in a swap, which is, uh, it's a, it doesn't

780
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,340
name use in derivatives. So I presume it's almost like a derivative. Maybe the trade is being

781
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:19,300
done like a derivative, a swap of, um, bad, mortgage-based securities with questionable backing,

782
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:26,900
being swapped for government bonds. So the banks can borrow and lend money, mainly borrow money,

783
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:32,980
based upon, uh, this, uh, secure bond. I mean, wow, are we propin' up the system or what? By the way,

784
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,740
considering it's the system we live in, you know, maybe that is the only right choice,

785
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:44,180
maybe it's the only thing that can be done. But one thing's for sure. Certainly, I fault the

786
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:49,220
mainstream media with explaining to people what this means. They get the facts, you know, you,

787
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,220
you look at the, at the, at the, at the 10 o'clock news, which is, I guess what everyone these days

788
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:59,380
catches, who watches news at 630 anymore. You catch the 10 o'clock news. And, you know, it's like,

789
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,460
oh, here's what the government's doing and the doing this with, uh, they're taking the, you know,

790
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:08,020
they're swapping out bonds for these excuses. And then there's no analysis. Nothing that the

791
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:13,140
common man can understand because of course, what's really happening is our tax money is being put at risk.

792
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:19,460
You know, this reasons why it's being done. None of that's explained, you know, it's really a poor

793
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:27,380
poor shitty job. And of course, that goes back to the government who, um, are not helping us.

794
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:32,420
You know, they're not, uh, they're not explaining what they're doing. Could it, you know, please,

795
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:41,540
please in this, uh, in this race for the Democratic nominee, uh, Hillary Obama, you know,

796
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:46,260
start, start talking to us like, like, shit that we give that we care about.

797
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:52,660
You know, oh, yeah. Now, both of you will, we'll nuke Iran. You've made that very clear. What are

798
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:57,300
going to do here? How does it work? Explain it to us? You know what, you can patronize me a little

799
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:02,500
bit. I don't mind. I think the first candidate, whether they're in the Democratic race or whether

800
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,180
they're in the general election, the first candidate actually talked about some of these issues and

801
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:10,740
say, hey, look, here's how it works and here's what we're doing. And here's the big game. And,

802
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:16,100
and this is the game that we're in, we're at the center of it. Oh, and by the way, the dollar, you know,

803
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:22,820
160 to the euros, two to be 170, even 180 is being predicted. And, uh, and it wouldn't be great if

804
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:27,780
Barack Obama said, you know, Adam Curry predicted a $2 a year on the daily source code. And,

805
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:33,220
and here's why I think he's right. You know, just do it. Just explain it to people. It's really

806
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:38,500
important. And by the way, I'm tired of struggling trying to figure it out myself. Hey, man, this is

807
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:43,700
I don't know. So you can buy this. I don't know. I know. I know is a friend. I think he still works

808
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:51,060
for out. Thanks for playing my, um, my message the other day. Oh, by the way, I'm, um, I, uh, I don't

809
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:56,900
live in Cupertino. In fact, I moved last year. I know live up in one country. Ah, some of those stock

810
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:02,100
options vested. Okay. Got you. I don't know. Well, welcome to the club. Uh, a couple of hours north

811
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:06,580
of the San Francisco. So if you're up for tasting some wine, I know you're not big on the

812
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,740
Reno, but, you know, I know you're going to appreciate it. So yeah, be careful. Do you just

813
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:16,580
mind see John? See you in me up there. Anyway, um, you know, I'm with you, we're going to hold

814
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:21,620
it up to see something. It's so obvious that there's a ton of hypocrisy. There's so obvious

815
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:26,180
that there's a lot of house cleaning to do in the United States and France and Great Britain.

816
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:31,620
I mean, especially in the United States, I mean, when Panama Bay, how can you be critical of,

817
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:43,060
you know, anything unthinkable in my opinion that some people who have voted for Bush twice,

818
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:50,100
who have supported the Iraq War, uh, now would be criticizing the human rights record in China.

819
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:57,300
That's so hypocritical. Thank you. Anyway, um, however there's one thing that that shocked me about what

820
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:05,860
you said, man, I would like what? Um, and in your last BSC, say, um, you know, people get the government

821
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:11,620
that deserve. Yeah, it's true, but it's true in a democracy, man, but, uh, you know, we can vote

822
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:17,460
in France and the United States and Great Britain. Yeah, okay, hold on a second. Hold on a second.

823
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:25,780
So yes, people get the government data, deserve. So what's happening in the United States? What's

824
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:32,100
happening in, uh, in Europe, uh, you know, France or the UK or whichever country you want,

825
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:38,020
it's all because of the government they choose. Now, um, sometimes you have to go beyond just voting,

826
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:43,380
okay, I never said people get the government they vote for. I said people get the government

827
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:49,140
they deserve. By the way, not an original A to the C quote, um, I picked it up somewhere.

828
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:53,620
Well, I said it, but a lot of people agree with that statement. In France,

829
00:46:54,580 --> 00:47:00,500
by the way, I'm trying to say France more, more often now, um, because it sounds so weird when everyone in the

830
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:06,180
the UK is talking about France and I say France. So I'm bear with me. In France,

831
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:12,740
yes, they have officials, they elected into office, but how do the French people make sure they get the

832
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:18,660
government they deserve? Well, they say, hey, government, you know, what you that decision you just made,

833
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:23,940
we don't like that. So you change that if you don't, we're going to strike. And if that doesn't

834
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,740
change your mind, we're going to burn your shit down. And you know what, the government listens to

835
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:35,700
that. Sometimes you have to do that. So respect, respect to the frogs of which you were one of,

836
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:40,660
no, highlight my pronunciation of your name, by the way. Okay, this is that house of the Lord

837
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:47,380
I don't know, but anyway, we can vote. We can vote, um, people trying to cancel,

838
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:57,300
people in Cuba can't. Okay, man, look, so same thing. America was founded the United States

839
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:05,540
or the new land and the new country. By people who could vote, right, they couldn't vote,

840
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:10,420
there was a king, a monarchy, they didn't like what the king was doing, they wanted a different

841
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:17,860
form of government, democracy, a friend's invention, by the way. And so they went and they said,

842
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,780
screw it. We're going to go start our own country, form our own government. They got the government

843
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:27,700
they deserved at the time. Um, which had nothing to do with voting. It had to do with the pure

844
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:32,980
anarchy. So if the Chinese want to do from government, um, I think there's a lot more Chinese

845
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:39,620
people than there are, uh, government officials in China. They can absolutely make a change, you know,

846
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:45,060
right now, they have the government they deserve. And I'm not one for inciting violence,

847
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:51,780
but you got to resort to that history is is papered all the way this far back as we can count

848
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:58,340
with violence to get governments to do what the people truly want. So no, they can't vote

849
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:04,100
democratically, then they have to rise up and they have to change that if they want to, they will,

850
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:12,340
every people's, every people's on earth has proven this. So, uh, that just doesn't float my

851
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:17,060
boat, my friend. They're not given that choice and they don't have access to all that information.

852
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:22,900
They don't, they're internet is either none existent, a completely censored intel. So you don't

853
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:28,580
need an internet, you need an axe, you to rock. That's all you need, rock. Anyway, not Iraq,

854
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:34,180
but a rock. Uh, just suits the top, man. Uh, you take care. I'm going to have a glass of

855
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:41,220
vino. And, uh, listen to, uh, the, uh, coming episode of a DNC, pick your man. Okay, I know.

856
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:47,380
So you understand what I'm saying, right? And by the way, the right to bear arms,

857
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:53,860
you know, that's not just for evil from outside our borders and our shores. It's internally as

858
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:58,980
well. And maybe even just look at it metaphorically speaking. But if we don't like the government

859
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:04,820
that we have, and that voting thing isn't working, by the way, I have to agree with my conversation

860
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:11,460
partner, John C. Devore Act, that it's all rigged. The candidates are rigged. Everything is rigged.

861
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:16,740
I, you know, even the voting machines are rigged. And there's been some pretty conclusive

862
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:23,060
evidence of that. We too may just have to rise up one day. And I'll tell you, I am very,

863
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:28,180
you know, look, I've lived 43 years. I'm a, I'm happy I made it this far. I'm, I'm prepared to rise up.

864
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:33,780
No problem. I'll, I'll make it better for my daughter. Oh, these kids growing up completely

865
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:39,860
apathetic to what's going on in the world. And by the way, um, I recorded my most recent entry into the

866
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:48,260
United States. Um, I took my, this was so funny. Uh, this was kind of on a, not a dare or a bed, but it was

867
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:53,460
like the next step in this. It's not been 10 or 11 times that I've been, this is 11th time. I think

868
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,300
whenever I entered the United States, I have to go to the first screening. Go through a secondary

869
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,900
screening, go through a tertiary screening, have my bags open. And it happens over and over again.

870
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:07,060
I get promise that I'm taking off the list, but I'm not taking off the list. And that's, so this

871
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:11,380
time I decided to record the whole process. Three stops and all coming into the country,

872
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:17,460
then going into secondary, then after I got my bag actually trying to get out of the airport,

873
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:24,340
there's another stop there. You know, check, questioned every single step of the way. And this time,

874
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:32,100
I recorded everything on my, uh, I river, uh, IFP 799, which is a pretty legendary device. It's what

875
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:38,420
I recorded, uh, I've been using that for, uh, four years now, almost. And, uh, man, the thing is still,

876
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:44,740
is still fantastic. Um, so no external microphone, just the internal mic. And I was just holding it

877
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:48,980
in my hand, okay? I didn't put it in my pocket. I was holding it in my hand like a cell phone.

878
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:54,580
And I literally, on the counter when I was talking to these people when they were interrogating me,

879
00:51:54,900 --> 00:52:00,340
I was just holding it. And I was even pointing it. I was directing the, I was pointing the

880
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:05,060
direction of the microphone towards them. And no one said anything. I mean, I was prepared, right?

881
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:09,060
If someone said, hey, what's that? I was, oh, it's my MP3 player, um, which it is. I wouldn't have

882
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:14,580
been lying. It just happened to be on record at the, at the time. So I have about two hours of recording.

883
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:20,340
And honestly, um, I just haven't had the time myself to cut that down into because I really want

884
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:26,180
to get those three segments. I want to process the audio. Um, it's very legible, but still, you know,

885
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:30,740
there's a lot of ancillary noise. So I just want to get it really good. John actually called me

886
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:34,020
and he said, hey, man, you know, we should talk about this because I think you're going to get into trouble,

887
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:38,340
uh, you know, this really could be bad. And I'm like, you fucking pussy. I'm going to play that.

888
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:42,180
So I will play it on the daily source code. Not going to do it today because I do, you know,

889
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:48,260
if I'm going to do it, I want to do it right. Um, I can actually, uh, just to prove to you that I have

890
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:55,460
it, not that you don't believe me, right? Um, hold on. I think I can drop this in here. Let me see if

891
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:05,060
this works. Hold on. Now, let me see if I can find a spot where I'm actually talking to one of

892
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:15,140
the officers. Oh, man, wait, I can't be that far in. Here it is.

893
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:21,140
Wait, I got to turn off the, uh, I'm not going to be there.

894
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,500
Uh, I'm just being there. What are you going to have now?

895
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,980
I need somebody to get this mess. Yeah.

896
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,500
I'm bringing any kind of plants or needs or food or vegetables. No, so

897
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:40,260
any kind of currency over $10,000 USD or you know. So you guys can probably see you can

898
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:44,900
hear, right? So you bring any fruits or plants into the country and you currency over $10,000. I

899
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:49,540
know, and I'll just play this a little bit. You see, it's not, it's not being processed, right? So

900
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:53,220
that's why I really want to hook it up right. But just listen to the first bit here. You can hear it.

901
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:57,540
I actually, well, listen, we're going to have to talk to a team leader. So I'm saying I got to talk to a

902
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:07,060
team leader. So now I'm giving her like attitude. Just bring her my record baby happens every time.

903
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:11,780
Yeah, it might, it just might be a tough one.

904
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:15,940
Yeah, it was a tough one. Has it? Yeah, every time.

905
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:20,420
Maybe they could help you. Yeah, they've been trying. But that's been pretty

906
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:26,500
unsuccessful. Yeah, last 10 times in a row. So she was actually quite helpful. No one was

907
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:32,180
mean. Again, but it's just dumb. And when I get this all cleaned up and when you hear the whole thing,

908
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:38,340
you will actually be pretty shocked because just based once again on the questioning,

909
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:44,020
they have absolutely no clue as to what they're looking for. And it's a waste of time. It's a

910
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:49,140
waste of money. And I don't actually believe we're any, we're better off because of this

911
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:53,940
shenanigans that they're literally going through. So that will happen probably after a

912
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:58,980
good back to Blighty. So stay tuned for it. Again, just want to process it so we can have maximum

913
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,140
enjoyment because there are some very funny bits in there as well, which I'm not going to tell you,

914
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:09,940
but well worth a listen. I know there was a song that was left on the drop drop that I owed us.

915
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:16,180
Slash that was the day of this. Yeah, we're there. Drop.io. Slash daily source code.

916
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:24,180
It's another protest song from our era. If you're in Europe, listen up to Fort Europe.

917
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:29,140
I'm Charlie seven five ohs. I was the point of time not long ago when people were still living

918
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:34,180
in the northern zone. They could still breathe and everybody wasn't there. Somebody recorded a song.

919
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:38,980
This is what it says. Half of the first and the second world was you think a few Europeans couldn't

920
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:43,540
take a no more. But we built up and caught on a Berlin wall. Only the building went and proved

921
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:48,100
the right. I chromed it for your own. This one was a bit tricky. Now visible to it and you can

922
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:52,100
die. And if you was lucky, you could slip through the cracks and impresses it. You're like

923
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:56,500
thunder. You're on this way. Some people knocking only to become second class citizens.

924
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,780
You're not listed in the system. Not existing in the city. You go in my grave.

925
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:04,100
But where lift the fittest and this place is called, me blush it and never went to put you

926
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:09,060
rope. My soul called you. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. We are behind the cold.

On you.

1019
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,060
Hey here.

1020
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,060
Yeah.

1021
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,060
Right here, and for you.

1022
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,060
Right here, and for you.

1023
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,060
Right here, and for you.

1024
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,060
Right there, and for you.

1025
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,060
Oh.

1026
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:57,660
I had to extract some recycled dust.

1027
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:02,460
taking care of business. I'm digging it. It's about time. We're all fed up, you know,

1028
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,540
and by the way, don't mind saying what's really on your mind. We'll play it. We'll get

1029
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:11,020
your message out there. Well, we'll make sure people here. You don't have to rely on mainstream

1030
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:14,540
media. You don't have to compromise in the language and what you're saying and who you're

1031
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:18,540
pissing off because we're there for you to support the artists who really have something to

1032
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:22,140
say. Yes. I have to go according to my media. Oh.

1033
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:36,300
This is Marsha Geller. She is, she runs a set of conferences called the IMedia conference. I did

1034
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:42,780
a keynote there once and they got like highest marks of all key notes ever. Not to stroke

1035
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:51,340
myself, which by the way will probably stop me from getting prostate cancer. Five timer for sure.

1036
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:59,180
And Marsha's cute. And she wants me to be on a panel, I think, for an upcoming IMedia.

1037
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:04,140
And honestly, I've been kind of scurrying around it because it might mean a special trip.

1038
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:09,980
It's in that Texas, which is not really somewhere that I find myself that often, although I do

1039
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:16,380
like Texas a lot. And I guess now she's calling into the daily source code voicemail line to

1040
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:21,340
get my attention. Let's see what she has to say. I'm not talking to Greg Meand, and I haven't

1041
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:24,860
heard that. No, sales, we's a Greg yet. Whether or not you're going to be able to reprise your

1042
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:32,540
appearance at the Texas agency permit. Go here. That is of course my job. I got to go out there

1043
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:38,300
and blow all these agencies so that they'll spend money on our network and make everybody and make

1044
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:43,500
the cash flow baby. That's all right. I accept that responsibility. Just coming up in a few weeks,

1045
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,700
I'd love to hear about the minister as possible. We're going to print with a book and I would love

1046
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:54,380
to have you join us. If you can give me a... Okay, so I think Russell Simmons is on the panel.

1047
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:58,860
And someone else, I'm not sure who else is on. It was a couple of names that didn't recognize.

1048
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:07,180
You know, I was like, I think, you know, go ahead and Google Marsha Geller. I think it's G-E-L-L-A-R.

1049
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:15,580
Let me just check for you. She's also on Facebook. Let's have some fun. Okay, guys. I got an idea here.

1050
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:24,140
Let me just see, M-A-R would be M-A-R-S-C-H. Like Marsha, yeah. Geller, I think that's it. Let me see if

1051
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:33,260
Marsha Geller. I don't know if that's the right spelling.

1052
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:40,700
Uh, because I get a lot of Sarah Michelle Geller. Well, it may be Geller with E-R.

1053
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:50,780
Oh, man. Yeah. With E-R, there you go. Marsha G-E-L-L-E-R. Now I'm going to look at images.

1054
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:58,460
You know what? Do some research. Go look around for... I'm not quite sure how to spell the name.

1055
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:04,060
Um, Marsha, if you're listening, send me a naked picture and I'll be on your panel.

1056
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:11,980
Isn't it? Come on. Hey, chuckleheads. That's fair. One naked picture of Marsha and I'll go on her panel.

1057
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:18,140
So get ready to jot down her details because what I want you to do is I want you guys to call her an emailer

1058
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:23,100
and say, you know, hey, I'm a part of the Daily Source Code community. I'm an official chucklehead or a

1059
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:30,540
Mr. Bond or a long time listener. First time caller. I'm a five timer. I'm a folder. I'm a scruncher.

1060
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:37,740
I'm taking the red bill. We all agree that if you want to add them on the panel, which of course will mean

1061
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:42,620
I'll probably miss another show because I'm too busy. Then you need to send them a naked picture.

1062
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:48,140
Add them at potshow.com. Add them at niveo.com or add them at curry.com.

1063
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:53,100
You call if you're down on a ground and in the country or somewhere near a phone would love to hear from you.

1064
01:02:53,100 --> 01:03:01,500
The number is 2-0-3-9-8-1-7-2-5-6. What do you mean email? It's Marsha M8 FHA at imediaconnection.com.

1065
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,780
Example, do you hear from me since I did? Yeah, do you win? Okay.

1066
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,860
All right. Leave it. Can't mind you sending it in.

1067
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:15,260
Yeah, I'm Highlander doing under. Okay. I'm from Sydney, Australia. Sunday early evening with some stuff. I just

1068
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:19,580
have to go off my chest. That's what I'm here for. I'm listening.

1069
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:23,180
So I've been listening to the DSC since I discovered it about three months ago.

1070
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:30,380
And as I've got, I'll be in Oz. I feel Julie qualified to talk about economics, finance, and money.

1071
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:35,100
Okay. As well as China and Tibet. If you think of economists such as John Law,

1072
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:39,420
Adam Smith, who's the author of a wealth of nations. Wait, let me guess. All Scots?

1073
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:44,220
Or even the first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, they were all Scottish.

1074
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:49,340
How was copper wire invented? I know the two Scots. I'm inviting over a penny. You got the

1075
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:55,740
So you've been talking about two separate subjects in China and the economy in the UK, US and Europe,

1076
01:03:55,740 --> 01:04:02,060
including this current credit crunch over the last few DSCs and a bit about it on no agenda as well.

1077
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:07,420
By the way, it's not just a credit crunch. I think we should get over that misnomer. That's like a code

1078
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:11,980
being used in mainstream media. I hear it all the time and Britain. You know, saying,

1079
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:18,620
well, you know, these are American problems that are hurting us, too. Bullshit. Bullshit.

1080
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:25,100
Is the international finance system? I don't know. Can't anybody see the money fix is what I'd call it?

1081
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:32,780
He, all the stuff is released. Yes. So the Chinese yuan is a currency that is not

1082
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:38,380
debt based on like Federal Reserve issued notes. The Bank of China is government controlled and

1083
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:43,260
issues one as a bill of credit. The snow interest is in card for its creation.

1084
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:48,540
Basically, the Chinese are doing what Lincoln did back in 1862. Wait a minute. Are you telling me?

1085
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:56,540
This is very interesting. So the Chinese, I guess, do what people like Ron Paul thinks we should be doing.

1086
01:04:56,540 --> 01:05:02,300
Well, it certainly doesn't seem to be hurting their economy. Okay, interesting. Good knowledge.

1087
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:06,700
When the U.S. Treasury issued greenbacks instead of private created, Lee contender.

1088
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:14,380
This is a naval China with his economic and miracle to form the biggest foreign exchange reserves in the world.

1089
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:21,260
A worth over $1.3 trillion. You heard that correctly. $1.3 trillion. What they're doing with some of

1090
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:26,940
this money is bailing out U.S. companies suffering from the subprime crisis. For example,

1091
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:34,940
Morgan Stanley, 5 billion in cash, but a 9.9% stake in a company back in December 2007.

1092
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:41,980
So China is the one place where the establishment moneymen have no stronghold and we effectively

1093
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:45,420
gave them the blueprint for their success whilst cutting everyone through it.

1094
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:52,380
Oh, very interesting. Okay. So we showed them how to do it with the greenbacks, which is not the

1095
01:05:52,460 --> 01:06:00,940
dollar we know as today, which was issued not by the Federal Reserve, but by the people.

1096
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:09,660
And China took that. Good idea. Thanks, guys. And then we went and stabbed ourselves and

1097
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:15,500
in our own back. Oh, man, you need a sub on status as well. Our Scottish sub on.

1098
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:20,700
And I do know that Tibetans are exempt from all taxation and the Chinese government provides

1099
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:27,100
90% of Tibet and government expenditure. So in an Olympic year, internal protest and hence

1100
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:33,660
suppression of Tibet is not about politics or freedom. It is about money. If we're worried about

1101
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:40,220
freedom, then we should worry about our own freedoms first. In China, they may not be politically free,

1102
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:46,700
but in the US and the UK, we're saddled up turn nets and debt. So I ask you, yes, we are slave to the

1103
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:52,220
man who is freeer. Indeed, to go on a further, what's the difference between democracy and China

1104
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:59,180
and the US? In both cases, the power rests in the hand of a few people with all the corruption

1105
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:05,340
and nepotism that comes with, at least this bullshit situation in China is semi-honest compared

1106
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:11,420
to having a non-majority, questionably elect present. You can't run a business, never mind a country.

1107
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:17,340
But it's dad and his friends are all just into the money man who on the turn of assimilating another

1108
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:23,180
country to the empire of unpayable, high-interest foreign loans from major US-funded

1109
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:32,220
re-building contracts make him present of the US-AV. The US and UK are really run by non-elected

1110
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:38,860
shadowy money man. Well, China is run by non-freedom to choose one party elected officials,

1111
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:45,580
which one sounds more democratic? The government is a shite state of affairs. Meanwhile,

1112
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:51,180
I had to leave the UK because a big brother killing my personal liberty, high-interest rates,

1113
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:56,860
meaning no chance of getting a mortgage, crappy immigration, financial, political and military

1114
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:02,940
subservience to the US. I'm telling you, man, Australia is a 24th province of China. What do you

1115
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:10,220
think are PM's big Mandarin? It's all about the money. So instead of protesting by not buying

1116
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:16,700
Chinese made goods, that's fucking the off-China and start fixing their own shit first. The economic

1117
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:22,700
credit crisis business cycle that screwing all countries that love so-called constitutionally

1118
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:29,820
guaranteed freedoms will be the last one initiated by shadowy powers that be, unless we can fight

1119
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:35,580
for own changes, our own freedoms, otherwise the balance of power and world economic control

1120
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:41,980
will move east over the wall. Great home, oh no hair, not not wink wink, hope you win

1121
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:49,340
yet. By the way, can I be the official Scottish Savannah? Hell yes, hell yes, hereby hold on

1122
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:56,700
Neil yes and okay, you are hereby knighted the official Scottish Savannah Highlander down under my

1123
01:08:56,780 --> 01:09:03,020
friend. Thank you. Good clarity there, that really helped. Yeah, absolutely. I agree, I don't know if

1124
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:08,780
you're right about everything, but it sounds right on and boy do I agree, we have to fix our own

1125
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:16,780
shit first. Really we do. You know, I was sitting with the Republican today, Ray Lane, one of our

1126
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:24,300
investors in Mivio. And, you know, he's going to vote for the party with the party chooses, right?

1127
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:28,220
He's going to vote for McCain, but I said, you know, dude, is that really the best you guys

1128
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:34,620
come up with? And he said, well, you know, I don't determine that anymore, because he used to be

1129
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:42,780
very connected into the party. And like, you know, we all determine this, you know, we really,

1130
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:50,060
we really, really, really got to do some soul searching, okay? And, boy, for me, you know, just it

1131
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:58,460
becomes so clear how easily we've been manipulated into a life of luxury. And, and I'm not talking

1132
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:05,260
about Louis Vuitton bags and Rolex watches, I'm talking about a roof over your head. You can go back

1133
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:11,260
50 years and there was, there were people in a lot worse situations in this country in the United

1134
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:17,740
States as well, all over. In the United Kingdom, wow, man, the blitz destroyed massive amounts of

1135
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:24,780
dwellings and livelihood and people. We've been through a lot of hard times, but it's just not

1136
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:30,300
you know, it we're not feeling the physical effect yet and we're being duped. We're being given

1137
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:35,260
all this luxury shit that is keeping us really occupied and, you know, we're pissed off when we

1138
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:42,940
can't sync up our iPod to iTunes. And meanwhile, we're being robbed. We really do have to get our own

1139
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:52,060
house in order. And you know what, we all have to do it together. Yeah, I had a PSC at a board in here

1140
01:10:53,500 --> 01:11:01,340
question of why we listen to the pod show. I'm in the same demographic as you, so I guess that's

1141
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:10,380
one of the reasons the second is all we all are connected. We're also all responsible. And I think

1142
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:15,740
you keep bringing that collide. And I think we need more people to bring that to life. Is that,

1143
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:27,500
well, yeah, it's all one big community. But we're also one big responsibility and we're responsible

1144
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:35,820
for everything to happen and everything that will happen. Just to tell it is from the music to the

1145
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:44,540
conversation. Always, always, always interesting, always interested in to hear something new

1146
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:51,980
and while sometimes it's just a rehash of the old thing and it's always a new opinion.

1147
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:57,820
And plus you like guys like me calling it, but you know, this is like this.

1148
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:06,860
Right. Like they say gray hair. Not so much anymore. I still think I have better hair.

1149
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:18,380
I'll be a normal, all that stuff. I'm people talking. Hell yeah. We are all connected. We are all

1150
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:27,260
in this together. You know, it was so surreal, surreal that I was in a cab the other day in London.

1151
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:31,660
Sorry, a new gilford from the train station to home to the manner.

1152
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:39,100
Talk about luxury. And I'm talking to the driver. I say, we from, he says, I'm from Iran.

1153
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:44,380
I said, oh, that's the country we want. We're going to bomb. And he's like,

1154
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:50,060
ah, he's man, man, that's so messed up over there. He says, you know, we're all, we're all young.

1155
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:53,980
And we've got the internet and the not enough people speaking, but they're really, you know,

1156
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:59,420
trying to get on board with that. But our government is suppressing us and they're crap.

1157
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:04,220
And we've got to change that and same thing came to mind. It said, man, you know, you get a government

1158
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:09,340
you deserve. We got the government we deserve. Should we really let a bunch of assholes drop

1159
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:14,220
bombs on us? Because they can't figure out what, it's like screw that.

1160
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:23,580
It was a guy, a human being. And I'm connected to him. And you know, we're doing commerce together.

1161
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:29,500
He's performing a service on paying. It's like, that's the way the world should work. And I know we can get there.

1162
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:36,700
My good friend Ray from from Holland sent in a song that was actually intended for a

1163
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:41,740
football Friday. But I want to play it today. It's kind of appropriate with people being connected

1164
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:47,740
and and being able to do beautiful things together. This is a track of the Reverend Al Green,

1165
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:53,820
who, of course, is quite a performer in his own right. And he was in the same studio as Chicago

1166
01:13:53,820 --> 01:14:01,980
in the 70s. And they were messing around and they decided to do an Al Green song. And he joined

1167
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:07,020
in on vocals. And this is actually a studio recording, which includes the pre-banchor before they

1168
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:11,260
start to record. And then the banter after I'll let the whole thing play out so you can hear how

1169
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:15,500
excited they were. This is people come and certainly in the 70s, Al Green and Chicago,

1170
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:21,900
two separate worlds. But all people, in this case, with a common interest, music. And when you

1171
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:27,100
really get together, you can make beautiful music together. But I came in, I thought I heard you

1172
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:37,020
felt rehearsing my tune. If it's cool, let's get together and do it. One, two, one, two, three, four.

1173
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:43,020
Sounds so good today.

1174
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:27,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1175
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:57,100
yeah yeah yeah yeah

1176
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:27,100
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1177
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:57,100
yeah yeah yeah yeah

1178
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:27,100
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I love me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah k vacation yeah yeah yeah there yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1179
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:57,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1180
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:24,260
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not, not, so cold, just fall down inside. Everything is crying now.

1181
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:28,540
How awesome is that, huh?

1182
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:32,620
I can't wait to go to the booth.

1183
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:35,060
I'll green and Chicago.

1184
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:37,340
And yeah, I too am tired of being alone.

1185
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,620
I think we're all tired of being alone.

1186
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:45,900
Not just alone but as individuals, but as just one people against another nation, I'm tired

1187
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:46,900
of being alone.

1188
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,460
Let's do this all together.

1189
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:52,740
We have the technology, we have the communication, we've got guys running our countries who

1190
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:56,340
are old-fashioned, I'm tired of being alone.

1191
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:59,140
Hey, live your life with passion, okay?

1192
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,860
And I'll talk to you as soon as I can.

1193
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:04,540
I hope it's going to be Friday and you know, you've got to enjoy your freedom.

1194
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:08,140
Another fine, medium presentation, share it with your friend.
