1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sheriff Charlie, 782.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:16,000
A very unusual noise, buzzing sort of noise, but many of many of buzzing buzzing say it the same time.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
All at the same time.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And suddenly it just stopped.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It stopped as quickly as it had begun.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You're waking me up.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm going to reach the first one to the most immediate hitman.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Four years of conversation that we've been to having has brought me to this point.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Many of you may feel the same.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Some may be afraid to speak out and fear of ridicule.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Fear not chuckle heads.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Together we're going to face the future.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The light that is our destiny.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Welcome to the next level.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Welcome to the Awakening.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Awakening.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now I say it's been a six month excursion,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but the process has actually something's been taking place my entire life.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Imagine a world where you wake up one morning,

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
only to realize that everything you believe in,

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
function entirely differently from the way you're perceiving it all of your life.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
A world in fact with the truth is off of the direct opposite of your reality.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fun story is about power, three kinds of power.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The power of minds, the power of rule.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And the power as in what makes our lights glow and keeps our vehicles moving.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Individually, collectively, these three forms of power all insist.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The energy in your life.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The light of illusion is that energy innovation was stifled.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The blue of this blue flag called the power of the generator

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
to create a world of energy and motion.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They spot oil.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
See the illusion and of course were amplified,

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
but we know this is a trick because of the context of being aware

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that we're watching.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Imagine show that of course you'll instantly be in love

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
like a god or fear like what you wake in it.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We're gonna wrap this program to bring you this new splatter.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm very mean.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
In particular, television is a trick.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I was a multimedia hitman.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I was merely meant to keep me a slave entertained into the next perished break.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Reading a reality in our minds.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There's a servant, I think.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I was meant to keep me a slave entertained into the next perished break.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Reading a reality in our minds.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There's a servant, I think.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
There's a servant, I think.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
There's a servant, I think.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Energy, I think.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think it's working.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
A media program.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I can create content that will make your brain react

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
in a free-determined manner.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If you really can't figure out how it works,

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
then you understand that it becomes ineffective.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Once you're aware of the code,

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
it can easily be borrowed from executing it to your personal.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Super obscure brain.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's how the youth and ex of E.J.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
with a podcast can do that.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Imagine where people would money a plan

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
or the decades it built up

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
an impressive infrastructure

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
of government, social and monetary systems

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
that they control entirely

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
all of the continued exploitation of us.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This professional system, however, has one fatal flaw.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It must continue to grow in order for it to survive.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It needs us.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The slaves

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
to be embedded to it in order to prosper

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
once upon a time.

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Those as cars and other true physical

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
stuff has been repossessed

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
they'll be no more meaning to the content of money.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Remember that none of this machinery

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
would ever have been created

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
at free energy been available to everyone.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I think we are about to discover

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
ourselves.

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Thanks to the evolution of our species.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm certain.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Our DNA has been defined

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
the pre-programmed to evolve

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and due to centuries of suppression.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The internet was, of course,

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
the elite's big Coca-Cola

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and I simply cannot solve it

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
or what designed our beautiful body machinery

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
wouldn't have added the required bits

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
to our brains to make us capable

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
of even its system of bread.

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It can't happen

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
to turn it up.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Either way, most of you are still very much asleep

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
in the reality created by the masters

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
that own us.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Many of you are awakening

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
seeing the truth that lies with it

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
it's only live to our limit.

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The elite's machine is creaking

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
under the strain of itself

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and fear.

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's all about the timing.

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The machine comes crawling down.

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And now for us need to be awake

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and prepared to take action.

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's actually my role to assist in your weight

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and it to communicate.

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's much more than I can.

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Now, I don't see it all again.

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll write all the praise, please.

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hold ones.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The zombies are earthquakes and land mass relocation.

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Nor do I fear black helicopters

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
in a misnive way, the snow for the night.

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But I certainly cannot get a rule any of it out.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Four years of conversation.

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We're going to have a nice party to disqual.

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We're going to the next level.

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We're going to be in the air.

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You're awakening.

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yo Ray, my brother.

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Thank you so much for that abbreviated 781 away.

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Getting chucklehead to low from the curry condo

126
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
on San Francisco. This is the daily source code.

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strap to my ass.

128
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Do the next generation radio content in my ears.

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm casting this out of the curry.

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm going to rest my eyes.

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Because I'm growing weary of

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's probably even trying to make

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So rather than imply

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't know what you just realized

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
All the things that you're trying to say.

137
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I've turned up a well

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But I think it ain't to see that

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Instead it's crumble

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Into a pattern we fell

141
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm floating raw in never itself.

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Why don't you

143
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What I'm saying?

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Even if the words are probably going to hurt

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'd rather have to choose to stop

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If it isn't here

147
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Don't you know

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What I'm saying

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What it is

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You're thinking

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Go I'm thinking

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's not what I want to hear

153
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And check my pride

154
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Because I'm a starting thing

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I will find something

156
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Good for things

157
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What it's like

158
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sinking in retrospect

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm getting mad

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I miss understood

161
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I make up your mind

162
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You're ready to decision

163
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm so excited

164
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I can't be touched

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll show you a way

166
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And so kind

167
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But keeping your mouth

168
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Feel short

169
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Rather than just walking

170
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Of the words

171
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Don't you know

172
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What I'm saying?

173
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Even if the words are probably going to hurt

174
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Rather than choose to stop

175
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If it isn't here

176
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm not going to hear

177
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What I'm saying

178
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What it is you're thinking

179
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Go I'm thinking

180
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's not what I want to hear

181
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And I'm trying to get

182
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm trying to get

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Because I'm your mind

184
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I just might find

185
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
All those things you left don't say

186
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And I'm trying to get out of my way

187
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And I'm trying to get out of my way

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And I'm trying to get out of my way

189
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Later on, after I'm gone, but you wish that you ever listen to me

190
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Ever listen to me

191
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Once on you, come right out and say it

192
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Even if the words are going to hurt, we're better off this one

193
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
While it's on you, come right out and say, come right out and say

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But I know you're thinking anyway

195
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Once on you, come right out and say

196
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Even if the words are going to hurt

197
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'd rather be truth to you

198
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Think it's not the essence of the world

199
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You're the one who runs away

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What is your thinking?

201
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What is your thinking?

202
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What is your thinking?

203
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What is your thinking?

204
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What is your thinking?

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm thinking it's not what I wanna hear

206
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:45,480
Ryan K. Come on right out and say it of course source from the drop the daily source code drop drop.au slash daily source code. Hey everybody how you doing it's

207
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:53,080
Episode seven. What's it? 72 coming to you from the curry condo and so a San Francisco Northern California

208
00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:02,120
Been here for a couple of days apologize. We haven't had a chance to hook up, but it was another interesting journey that I went through leaving Sunday morning from

209
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,640
the

210
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,640
From the manner off on

211
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,840
Virgin it actually for the first time and we really had a bad experience with the

212
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,280
With Virgin not that the trip was bad. Okay, there was a two hour delay, but you know, it should happen

213
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:23,260
So I'm used to that and actually gave me a chance to chill out a little bit longer in the clubhouse and have a nice leisurely black black fist breakfast

214
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,300
But upon arrival in

215
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,700
in San Francisco my bag apparently did not make the flight

216
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,560
Now there's some couple of things that happened before I find out about that of course

217
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,680
I had my regular customs border patrol entry into the United States my mother land home

218
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:50,200
Where I was born. I have a passport. I've always had an American passport. I've never had anything else and for the past 11 times now in counting

219
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,280
I get secondary questioning this time. However. I got some actually secondary and tertiary

220
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
questioning

221
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
I

222
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,200
I learned a lot this time. So here's the sequence

223
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,680
And of course, I'm going to have to repeat this on no agenda for those of you that listen to to both the the daily source code

224
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,760
Or someone pointed out the diligent source code. I like that one

225
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
No agenda. I'll have to retell this

226
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
this

227
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,160
The John C. Duborac as well. My my jab and buddy

228
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,480
So they read the RFID chip on my

229
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,440
No my passport and I can see in the

230
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Port of Port of Patrol customs border patrol agents eyes. You know, I get to go. She got one of those

231
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,680
Starts tapping away at the keyboard and I make my usual mark like she let just walk straight on down the secondary

232
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,480
I know where it is. It's happened to me ten times before and you know, she gave me one of these looks and but she was nice

233
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,480
I could tell she had a good pretty good vibe

234
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
said, well, let me just make a call

235
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,480
So a colleague of her came calling of hers came over

236
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,680
They looked at the screen a little bit now by by now. There's a lot of information on my account

237
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,680
Okay, because I've had to give all this information to them

238
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:09,480
So they know my address in the UK. They know my the condo address here in San Francisco

239
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,280
You know the address of the office. They've got my phone numbers

240
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,980
They know that I have a wife and daughter

241
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:24,580
They know a lot because I've had to answer all these questions and of course I have to answer all those questions because there's no

242
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,780
You know, no basically no rights before you are admitted into the country

243
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:34,980
Which is why they could also if they wanted to look at my laptop scan and take it away and whether you like it or not

244
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,980
It is kind of a gray area, but you do not you are not protected by the

245
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,980
Constitution before you enter the United States

246
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:49,980
And they were actually quite nice now, you know what they said and they put an M on my landing card

247
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,980
Now you can just go through and after you get your bag you can you'll talk to the agents over there

248
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,980
Which is what I would call the territory or the third question, but I could skip the secondary this time

249
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,980
That was nice because that's that back room

250
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,980
Which makes you feel like a real criminal in your own country

251
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,980
So and and of course I still had no idea what the M was for

252
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,980
Then I'm waiting for my bag and my name is announced

253
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,980
I'm going to pay his cup to the desk

254
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,980
I'm like oh man back to secondary

255
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,980
And that's when they told me about my bag of course I was somewhat annoyed by this

256
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,980
But I went to the to the accident of course

257
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,980
They saw the M on my landing card put it into the little blue envelope when over to the

258
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,980
Customs border patrol agent who was also I have to say nice, but you know they know me by now

259
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,980
You know they call me but my first name

260
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:44,980
I hadn't met this agent before, but you know he goes in and checks it and he verifies a couple things which of course

261
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,980
I just said you know and I said yep, that's right. That's the address

262
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,980
And I get the chat and with my said what's the M for?

263
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,980
That's for like money, mayhem, mojo

264
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,980
He said no, it's a match. Oh, that makes sense

265
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,980
I said this is the Adam Curry in Nebraska, and he gives me a look like I know all about it

266
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,980
You know I know but you know come on and he has a different date of birth

267
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,980
He lives in Nebraska. Yeah, you know I'm not him. It's him by the way

268
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,980
Why don't you just arrest the guy please?

269
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,980
Let's get rid of this. He says well look

270
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:22,980
I can't tell now the agency that is observing him does not want to arrest him and they can't

271
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
They're observing him

272
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,980
Okay

273
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,980
You are warned Adam Curry in Nebraska and

274
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,980
I said well can't you just take my name off the list?

275
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,980
That's kind of the problem because if I take your name off the list then we won't be watching for him either

276
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,980
So there's the conundrum

277
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,980
As it turns out and many did the John Smiths out there and know this but there's a couple of Adam Curry

278
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,980
You know there's an Adam Curry place basketball

279
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,980
There's a young Adam Curry who passed away recently

280
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,980
Because you know this shows up in my ego filters right?

281
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,980
No, so I think it was a 17 year old kid and he died recently

282
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,980
I think leukemia

283
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,980
That's a real bummer to see your name on no bituary

284
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,980
So that's another part of the system that of course is an inherent flaw which you

285
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,980
Yeah, you really yeah of course you could match birth date records

286
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,980
But you know you're still they're still going to want to question you

287
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,980
So that kind of makes sense and I sent me on my way so

288
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,980
Learn something and now I'm just going to lay it right out. Hi. I'm not the Adam Curry from Nebraska

289
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,980
Just please send me on through. I'll tell the other agent that in a good day

290
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,980
So

291
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,980
Okay

292
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,980
But of course, I didn't have my suitcase. This was not good

293
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,980
And it took me a full let's see

294
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,980
So the next flight was going to arrive Monday afternoon

295
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,980
And my bag actually didn't come into my possession until around 830 Monday evening

296
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,980
And of course contained in my bag was all my shit

297
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,980
You know my microphone, my equipment

298
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,980
So that's part of the reason that we haven't spoken

299
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,980
But also I've just been kind of beat on the on the time zone

300
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,980
And great to be back in the office though it's mevio man

301
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,980
It's what a great vibe. We're going to make it

302
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,980
If the world doesn't melt down around us if if we don't go into a complete economic

303
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,980
And mayhem

304
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,980
This is a good team, you know, we're working in some ass

305
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,980
I'm really proud of what everyone's been doing

306
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,980
Very, very proud

307
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,980
And yeah, it's just been good and so obviously working hard

308
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,980
We've got another level of things that we're coming out with

309
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,980
So plenty of work to do and that's what I'm here for primarily

310
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,980
Of course this is a

311
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,980
This is not really my mevio responsibility this show is between you and I

312
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,980
Before I go any further I want to wish Dr. Ron Paul's wife

313
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,980
All the best and health and good vibes to her

314
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,980
She's in hospital you may have heard about this

315
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,980
Ron Paul of course is holding the rally for the Republic on September 1st

316
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,980
And second in Minneapolis I'll be emceeing the event on September 1st

317
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,980
I can't wait for this. I'm so energized now that I witnessed my own awakening

318
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,980
From the terror of the energy elite under whose power we've been living

319
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,980
I've certainly been living for almost 44 years

320
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,980
Excited about meeting a lot of other people who are awake on one spot

321
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,980
That's going to be fantastic

322
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,980
But this is of course is a massive bummer

323
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,980
For Dr. Ron Paul is wife of course and their family

324
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,980
So no sooner had I released episode number 781

325
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,980
Which thank you so much for all the feedback

326
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,980
It started off kind of slow but then it just came barreling in you know people

327
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,980
Actually I'll play some of these some of these comments and I haven't gone through the voice

328
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,980
Mill yet. I just haven't had the the time

329
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,980
Because you know I have to listen to all of it each one has a maximum of three minutes

330
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,980
But you know that I mean that could that's sometimes as hours of work

331
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,980
And I just don't want to miss anything. I want to get all the good ones

332
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:57,980
But you know just fantastic comments and emails and links and

333
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,980
And I just opened up a whole new world to me

334
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,980
But of course no sooner had we talked about a lot of these things

335
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,980
Then the energy elite strike once again and the media particularly in the United States

336
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,980
But also the BBC what I've been looking at have really I mean

337
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,980
Oh what when you when you know what's going on and you see how it's being being reported

338
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,980
Because many of you will think that Russia these evil dudes have tried to commit genocide

339
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,980
On an ethnic group of people who had separated themselves from their country

340
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,980
Nothing could be further from the truth

341
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,980
Now of course I'm talking about Georgia and the fighting in South of Syria

342
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,980
And the Russian retaliation because that's exactly what happened

343
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,980
You have to understand some of the facts to start off with this is all about oil

344
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,980
It is indeed the black gold and I could have seen this coming this is really pissing me off

345
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:02,980
If you look at the map and please from time to time go ahead and roll out Google Earth and go look at Georgia

346
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,980
See where it is see how it lies in relation to Turkey to the black sea

347
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,980
How you know where the cast be in seas in regards to what the caucuses

348
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,980
Look at South of Syria and read some of the history you know

349
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,980
Even Wikipedia will be good enough just to read up on some of this stuff

350
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,980
Come on please that's really important that you do this

351
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,980
But just looking at the map it can really really open up your eyes

352
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:34,980
So without going into all of the history of Georgia and how it came to be and why it separated from Russia

353
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,980
It's quite important to understand that the president of Georgia

354
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,980
Soxvali

355
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,980
Mikhail Soxvali

356
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:52,980
Was educated and of course cultivated and probably chipped in the United States

357
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:59,980
And for the past couple of years this country whose minister of foreign defense is an Israeli

358
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,980
I believe at all they don't have absolute proof but from what I've read he's ex Mossad

359
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,980
In fact there's several Israelis in the in the Georgian government

360
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:17,980
They've been building up weapons they've been doing war games back basically practicing for war

361
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,980
There's been American mercenaries who've been sent over there

362
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,980
Those are actually called security consultants that's black water

363
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,980
Okay, that's that's what that is mercenaries

364
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:36,980
And you know they were essentially going to fight a war on behalf of the United States

365
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:42,980
The European Union will just put them in there certainly NATO

366
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,980
Against Russia

367
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:52,980
And it's all about oil and here's where I could have seen it coming because British petroleum who has a pipeline oil gas pipeline

368
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,980
Along the Caucasus, which is right there in South of Syria

369
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,980
Where the with all this has taken place

370
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,980
Remember the Russians kicked the CEO out of the country

371
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,980
About three or four weeks ago and there's you know something these are problem whatever

372
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,980
That should have been the clue that something was a foot of course not to mention the fact that Russia has

373
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:19,980
There was a Putin or was it Medvedev who said you know I'm kind of considering doing some business with Cuba once again

374
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:25,980
Now that the United States wants to put rockets in places near to our border like Poland

375
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,980
And that's what that would have been that would have been the tip off

376
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,980
So here's what actually happened of course you can find accurate reports around the web

377
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:43,980
But in general what you've heard probably is Russia has started to commit genocide for apparently no reason

378
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,980
And by the way, I'm not going to try and tell you that the Russians are good guys, you know

379
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,980
It basically absolute power you've heard this before corrupts absolutely

380
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,980
So no one is completely clean

381
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:05,980
But the essence of it is that the United States doesn't want Russia to become powerful with oil

382
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:19,980
And you know and it blows me away, but we literally are so courageous in our audacity to go and and capture their oil

383
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,980
Trying to steal their pipeline and here's how we did it

384
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:30,980
We sent troops in the form of mercenaries and weaponry and God knows what else to Georgia

385
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,980
You know we've been working with the president there Georgia for a long time these railies did the same

386
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,980
And in the stealth of the night

387
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,980
On the eve of the Olympics I mean how cowardly can you be

388
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,980
These guys went in and attacked civilians

389
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,980
5,000 people by the accounts I read are dead just blown to bits has nothing left

390
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,980
But pieces of hands and fingers and feet

391
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,980
And then of course the Russians retaliated

392
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,980
First strike was the Georgians make no mistake chuckleheads

393
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:10,980
First strike was the Georgians has even some great articles on the source code drop at drop.io slash daily source code

394
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,980
We can read all about it. Please read up on the history

395
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,980
So the Russians of course saw all this coming that's why they had built up some armament on the other side of the border

396
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,980
That's why they kicked out the CEO of British petroleum because they saw all this coming down

397
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:30,980
They saw what was happening and this has been completely orchestrated by George Bush Dick Cheney

398
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,980
Please let me put in there the fine Dutch politician, Yaptaho Scheffer of NATO

399
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,980
Who's the Secretary General

400
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,980
And they basically started a war by proxy

401
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,980
And I think there's a couple other things to this

402
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,980
I think that this is really a tipping point a massive tipping point

403
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,980
First of all we could we could be on the brink of a serious

404
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,980
Conflict with Russia I mean this could be real war

405
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,980
I mean and this could include like you know nukes why not

406
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,980
Because the Russians have the oil now

407
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,980
They are the ones that are really

408
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,980
Running a lot of the oil game particularly for the European Union

409
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,980
So you see how it all fits together and I believe

410
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:23,980
I believe that this the whole trying to ratify the Lisbon treaty to get the European army together is a part of this

411
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,980
It's starting to feel like it because you know who's who's going to fight the war with Russia

412
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,980
If America is over in America

413
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,980
Well it's of course it's the EU

414
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,980
And this is going to be maybe another wall or you know block head

415
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,980
It's just oh it's starting to unfold right before I very eyes and yet it may be a long way away

416
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,980
But it's coming closer to you every single day

417
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,980
And it's not even that far you know if you're in the UK you know how far is it really

418
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,980
And it's coming closer

419
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,980
Along with this

420
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,980
I say remember Lindsay Williams was talking about that oil

421
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,980
That was going to be discovered up in the north pole

422
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,980
Well, so I think this is going to be a part of it

423
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:13,980
So I guess there's this is a huge oil reserve up in the north pole which is going to turn out to be

424
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,980
Unclear whether it's Russian territory or not

425
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,980
And there's going to be some fighting for that for sure

426
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,980
He also said that there was going to be a huge oil reserve

427
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,980
This is Lindsay Williams

428
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,980
The pastor who has all this information

429
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,980
If you have a Google Lindsay Williams to get the backstory on that

430
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,980
Most of you are probably heard about it through a source code

431
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,980
He also said that there would be a huge oil strike in Indonesia

432
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,980
And I'm only starting to realize now you've heard of the of T-Boer

433
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,980
East T-Boer and the conflict

434
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,980
Go look at the map and all of a sudden you're going to understand that all of this shit is about oil

435
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,980
We're killing people

436
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,980
Blowing them up with hand grenades

437
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,980
For oil it truly is the only currency that matters

438
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,980
So the Russians actually did I think something that you know

439
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,980
Let's just say that this whole piece of cord hangs together and the and the truce

440
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,980
At least for now with Georgia

441
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,980
The fighting stops or you know continues to start

442
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,980
I think it's still going on and no one's really quite sure

443
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,980
The news is you can't trust it

444
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,980
You expect particularly when you've got reports saying Russia is the aggressor

445
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,980
So and I'm just trying to find time to do all this

446
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,980
Russia I think did the right thing

447
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,980
And actually a very powerful statement by saying hey you know what okay

448
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,980
We're just going to withdraw stop no more

449
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,980
And we'll shut off that oil too

450
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,980
You watch

451
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,980
Now the next part of the plan that I think is going to it's going to take place

452
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,980
I think that oil and I'm totally changing my stance here

453
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,980
Oil is going to drop down to 60 or 50 bucks

454
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,980
And and what probably will happen

455
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,980
Is that

456
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,980
The United States is just going to become insignificant on the world scale

457
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,980
It's going to be Russia. It's going to be China. The Middle East will probably be

458
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,980
Bankrupt by an extremely low oil price

459
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,980
Remember this has nothing to do with supply and demand

460
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,980
I don't know how they do it

461
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,980
But you cannot argue that someone's fucking with the price of oil

462
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,980
I mean you just don't go to 145 and 14647 dollars a barrel

463
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,980
And then a couple weeks later down to 1312

464
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,980
You don't do that unless someone really controls it

465
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,980
Someone is controlling this and just doing whatever they want to manipulate our heads

466
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,980
So I think the Arabs are going to go out of business

467
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,980
The Middle East is going to be just going to be shut down

468
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,980
It's going to be Russia. It's going to be China

469
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,980
And unless we do something about it unless we change what we're doing

470
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,980
Internally in our own company in our own country

471
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,980
Yeah company it is kind of a company when you have a commander and chief

472
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,980
In the United States and by the way

473
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,980
Let's not rule out the United Kingdom

474
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,980
Also a part of this

475
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,980
And of course I'm not talking about the people

476
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,980
I'm only talking about the leaders

477
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,980
And who's doing all of this? It is the same people as always

478
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,980
It's the Roth child, it's the Rockefellers, it's Warburg

479
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,980
These are the names that you got to look out for

480
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,980
And it hit me again and this totally makes sense for this

481
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,980
Dollar 50 dollar barrel of oil

482
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,980
Maybe 60, I'm just guessing

483
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,980
But it's going to be that low

484
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,980
I saw a report and I'm going to have to look it up

485
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,980
Because I didn't have time to do the prep on this

486
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,980
There was an investor

487
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,980
I think any was an Australian investor

488
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:47,980
Some guy who put like 30 or 40 million dollars into an airline

489
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,980
And he thought it was a time now to invest in airlines

490
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,980
Sounds like why is this guy putting money into airline

491
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,980
Oil is out, the cost of flying is so outrageously expensive

492
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,980
And then I remember recalling that the advisor on the deal

493
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,980
Was the Roth child bank

494
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,980
So of course, so they know they know that the oil is going to drop

495
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,980
Because they're controlling it

496
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,980
Am I not? Maybe

497
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,980
In fact, maybe I'm just freaking psyched

498
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,980
Who else is the skin to fling excited go?

499
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,980
And then I remember recalling

500
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,980
Can we make everything that's gone

501
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,980
But she's time for no big time

502
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,980
And then it makes me want to win one

503
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,980
The back and the change when we were young

504
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,980
When everything was like you're lonely and gone

505
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,980
Ready to go up in the middle of the night

506
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,980
And yet you know we're gonna win again

507
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

508
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

509
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,980
Baby I'm the one, baby I'm the one

510
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,980
Baby I'm the one, no we are

511
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,980
It's the first time you're here

512
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,980
Baby I'm the one, baby I'm the one

513
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

514
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,980
Yeah, yeah

515
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

516
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,980
I'm the one, no, no, no

517
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,980
I never met any of the little girl

518
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,980
She has something to feel at both

519
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,980
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah

520
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,980
You'll imagine the girl

521
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,980
And the back and the change when we were young

522
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,980
When everything was like you're lonely and gone

523
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,880
Ready to go, a man in the middle

524
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,180
Yeah, yeah, no, I can't

525
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,980
Well, no, I can't

526
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,780
Baby, I'm the one

527
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,580
Baby, I'm the one

528
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,580
Who is it?

529
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,380
It's the first time you're here

530
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,380
Baby, I'm the one

531
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,180
Baby, I'm the one

532
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,180
Yeah, I'm the man in the middle

533
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,780
I can't play, I'm the one

534
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,580
I'm the one

535
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,780
Yeah, I can't play

536
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,380
I'm the one

537
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,180
Yeah, I'm the one

538
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,180
I'm the winner

539
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,780
I'm the one

540
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,780
You've been to this world

541
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,540
But everything's like a normal

542
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,780
It comes out

543
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,980
What an wild, big camera

544
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,180
It isn't enough

545
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:58,180
We're not here, baby, I'm the one

546
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,180
Baby, I'm the one

547
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:05,180
We're not here, we're not here, we're not the one

548
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,180
Baby, I'm the one

549
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:14,180
I appreciate all the work you guys been doing, uploading tracks to the source code drop the drop.ado slash daddy sort of

550
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:32,180
ceote pudding um I need three tags in there in the comments. unfortunately not for this one

551
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:37,380
code putting ID3 tags in there in the comments. Unfortunately, not for this one, but I'd like

552
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,620
the song a lot, say I knew I'd go off on the deep end there with the youngest Georgia thing.

553
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,580
So I had to play that psycho is the title. I have no idea who did it. Please go back and

554
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:51,220
put a comment. It's a great idea. That dropped stuff. I'm loving that more and more. If you got

555
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:55,860
a voicemail comment as well, go over to drop.io slash daily source code. There's a number there

556
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,900
and you have to use a pain code. I know it's a pain in the ass, but then everything's in one place.

557
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:05,380
It's really fantastic. It makes production so much easier because remember, it is kind of like a

558
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:13,380
one man ban, you know. Let's see. This one's been in the email for a week now and I want to

559
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:19,220
make sure I get to it because it is my buddy who I love talking to whenever he can stop by CSB.

560
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:39,060
Come on in, CSB. Hello, Adam. Hey baby. Hi, Kerry. Here is CSB or EU correspondence. Yes, what's

561
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:46,180
happening? I wanted to mention that European Union cares about its citizens and it is why

562
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:53,940
self-extinguishing cigarettes will be compulsory in three years. You know, I heard about this.

563
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:59,620
And the reason why the self-extinguishing cigarettes will be compulsory is so that you don't

564
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:06,260
burn down your house while you're smoking in bed. This is a long alliance. All of this stuff

565
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,740
is happening. It's not just in the EU. You know, I think I've mentioned the codex elementarious.

566
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:16,980
You should Google that. It's basically, I think it literally means codex, CODEX,

567
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:23,700
elementarious is food law. And this is, people have been talking about this because pretty

568
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,180
soon, not only will governments around the world starting with Europe and this is already law

569
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:35,940
and many of the member states, but it's soon to be harmonized, harmonized. Another word for law

570
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:45,780
everywhere. And it's determining what kind of nutrients you can have. How much vitamin C you can

571
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:53,700
take and how much vitamin C and other types of organic products and minerals you can actually

572
00:33:53,780 --> 00:34:00,660
have determining what you can put in your face, which is just fundamentally wrong.

573
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,100
No one should be able to determine what I want to eat. That's up to me.

574
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:11,540
But it's actually happening. And so along the lines, there's CSB just like it was on the news recently

575
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:21,300
in the States and no longer allowing fast food joints to be in poor areas because it makes poor

576
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,220
people sick. It makes rich people sick too, by the way. I just like the point that out. But

577
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:34,340
regardless, how about education, how about giving us some good food? To food that is affordable

578
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:41,620
instead of telling us what to do. Yeah, okay. Yeah. So it's automatically extinguishing cigarettes.

579
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:49,940
Very important. You who for the EU and EU cares not only about the people, but also about the

580
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:57,380
cause. So the new panorurapian frequency range will be assigned for smart vehicle communications

581
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:02,340
system. I've heard about this. This is so the cars talk to each other. So cars will be talking

582
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:09,060
with each other to reduce traffic and excellence. So really use a force of good and peace in the

583
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:14,420
way. You don't think that that's so we can track your car. Do you? It's only so the cars can talk

584
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:20,900
to each other. What is that all about? Interesting. Interesting way to solve the traffic issues.

585
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:28,740
But what about you say Adam? Why don't you tell us who do you support for next

586
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:37,140
EUSA president? Is it Obama or McCain? Only these two choices, which one? Well, you said us.

587
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,340
Well, CSB, you know, first of all, there are more choices. You don't have to vote for either one

588
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:48,980
of those. And neither of them are the official candidate for their party. So I can't give you an answer.

589
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,180
I don't kind of still kind of write Ron Paulin. I mean, I'm sure there's all kinds of stuff.

590
00:35:54,180 --> 00:36:00,500
I can do. I don't have to vote for Obama or from McCain. So I hearing now that someone said that

591
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,740
it looks like Hillary, Hillary might indeed. Hillary Clinton might indeed become the vice president

592
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:12,820
and presidential nominee. It's crazy. It doesn't matter. They're both two sides of the same coin.

593
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:21,300
In fact, I read somewhere I really like this quote that the new world order, which by the way,

594
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:29,460
you might have heard the president of Georgia on maybe on CNN. I don't have a sound clip of it.

595
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:34,740
You might have heard, uh, Soxvili call for a, we need world order. He said, we need world,

596
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:40,020
it didn't say new, but they, but just add that. We need new, we need world order.

597
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,260
And I think Bush said it too. We need some world order. Well, they've often talking about

598
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,220
new world order.

599
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:55,540
Um, shit. Now I don't remember when I was talking about crap. I lost it. Never mind. This is so much

600
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:03,380
more to do. Um, here we go. A couple of, uh, a couple of news articles. This is nuts. I don't

601
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,900
understand, this is really funny. Out of the UK, BBC reports that Prince Charles is now coming out

602
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:14,340
against genetically, uh, that's where that's where I was on that rant. They're good. I knew I

603
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:20,500
knew it all fit together. But genetically modified food. And, uh, he's calling, uh, he's warning

604
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,300
for a disaster. Companies developing genetically modified crops, risk creating the biggest environmental

605
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,180
disaster of all time, Prince Charles is warned, which is fantastic. But I'm, I'm looking for the

606
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,740
employee here. I'm looking for, where's the hook? Because as far as I understand, Prince Philip,

607
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:41,780
the current, uh, Queen's husband, you know, he's been, he's been, uh, called out and identified

608
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:47,540
as, uh, one of the architects behind the plan for depopulation for killing us all. He said it.

609
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:53,300
There, you know, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's quoted in, uh, I think, um, certainly on the BBC,

610
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:57,860
but also I believe on the Guardian. He said, you know, uh, overpopulation, we got to do

611
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:03,460
some about that. And I think that he's probably behind or involved a lot of these genetically

612
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,900
modified foods, which are killing us, which is not food anymore, that all the food is sucked out.

613
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:14,580
I, I don't know what they're doing, but it's no good. So, uh, keeping my eye on that story for you.

614
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:20,100
But good on your Charles, if you're, if you're real about it, more European news, this is, uh,

615
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:28,980
this is pretty funny. It's like a bad omen. The, um, the ceiling of the European Parliament in, uh,

616
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,980
Straussburg, you know, they have, they, because they couldn't work it out amongst themselves. They

617
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:38,420
have to meet in Brussels and then 12 times a year in Straussburg. I think it's 12 times, um,

618
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,980
the ceiling cave did. Now, luckily, no one was heard because they're all in vacation

619
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,860
all the world is collapsing around us, but there's a little picture. I'll put all these links

620
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,700
in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com. And I can't even see this video. I haven't seen the video,

621
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:56,980
but there's video of it, too. Um, and it collapsed down onto the seats where normally, uh,

622
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,780
administered of Parliament, uh, would have been sitting. So maybe the timing was just wrong

623
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:11,140
of the ceiling falling down or, uh, or it's just an omen. Um, I was talking about the Lisbon Treaty

624
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:18,020
earlier. There's a, I got to turn it on this new website that I found called euroactive.com.

625
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:24,500
Only don't complete the active with an e-sodes echo uniform Romeo, Alpha Charlie Tango, India Victor,

626
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:31,220
euroactive.com. And there's a piece here by, let me see if there's a byline. It doesn't say who wrote it.

627
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,140
Oh, it's an interview. No illusions on eU Treaty ratification.

628
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:50,180
Uh, see if, uh, this is the chief editor of, um, the French Quarterly Politek ettology. I think

629
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:56,500
as I pronounce it eU later's plan to return to Brussels in October. October. That's got to get

630
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:04,580
some good vacation. To debate the union's future after islands no vote, but Dominique Moisey of the

631
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:09,620
French Institute of International Relations warns the eU's French presidency is, of course,

632
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:16,180
that sarcozy. With its attempts to pressure Dublin into a revote and to blackmail the check

633
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,260
and Polish presidents into ratification by threatening the blocks further enlargement.

634
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,100
I'll just, I just got to continue reading this because the best way to explain what he's trying to

635
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:28,020
say here. The iris know to the Lisbon Treaty and the referendum last June represents a warning

636
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:33,780
signal for Europe said, uh, Moisey, who found it the IFRI. That's the Politek ettology air.

637
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:39,540
He insists that islands rejection of the text is not an isolated case. See, this is another thing

638
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:45,380
that that we've been misreading and misinformed about in the media. He calls it actually the third

639
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:51,860
negative referendum after the no, uh, from France and the Netherlands on the Constitution in 2005.

640
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:58,260
We've had a profound divorce between Europe citizens and the European Union. So as the

641
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,340
practical hurdles of ratification here comes the analysts underlines in particular that the

642
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:08,420
Euro skeptic check president, uh, Vachlav Klaus won't change his mind. That means he's not

643
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:14,580
going to ratify it. Being determined in his euro skepticism, Poland also will prove difficult.

644
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:22,100
So, um, you can read this whole interview, uh, the links at, uh, daily source code.com. Just so

645
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:27,220
you know, it's, it's not, uh, it's not going to be that easy. And they are definitely trying to force

646
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:31,540
this night. And at this point now, I've got to believe it's all about putting together a European

647
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:38,660
army to, I guess, fight the Russians. Are we fucking nuts? I've been to Russia.

648
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:46,740
You know, uh, uh, uh, I've traded stuff with people on red square. You know,

649
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:53,220
and I'm sure that Iran is now in peril as well. You know, of course, Russia's relations with

650
00:41:53,220 --> 00:42:01,300
Iran. That will be seen as, as wrong by the US and, and the Israelis and, uh, or Israel, I should

651
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:12,100
say, and, uh, the NATO. It's just people, man. I don't hate anybody. And anyone out there hates

652
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:18,740
us hate anyone. It's enough to go kill him. I mean, our army of waking up now to see that it's not

653
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:25,060
the population that every word just as much slaves of our government as they are of theirs and

654
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:30,340
an up on top, sit, uh, the energy elite, because it's all about oil. It's all about oil. It's not

655
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:38,500
about oil. Then it's about drugs. Approved with that BBC news. This came out to, uh, that may

656
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:43,460
make it got this off of the drop. Now, this is from us from today. Britain's policy of being tough

657
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:48,580
on drugs is pointless as a former civil servant who once ran the cabinet's anti-drugs unit.

658
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:56,260
Yeah, no kidding. So, of course, it doesn't, doesn't do anything. But I was thinking about this,

659
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,540
where are all these drugs coming from? You know, if it's so hard for me to get into the country,

660
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:06,100
you know, whenever even I fly the delta share of my own plane, you know, I've got customs agents

661
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,660
and immigration's waiting for me. Not just for me, for anyone who's who's flying around privately,

662
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:16,020
you know, you can't just sail about, uh, right onto into the UK, loaded with drugs.

663
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:21,780
And God knows it seems like there's enough available. So these are not small shipments, either.

664
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:27,860
Who is the only outfit organization that could actually get drugs into any country?

665
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,060
And I'm not talking about marijuana because, you know, that's a plant and it grows and it's called

666
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:39,860
weed for a reason. You can do a lot more with hemp than smoke it. I think that's part of the

667
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:46,420
reason why it's illegal for other things other than smoking. But anyway, heroin, cocaine, opium,

668
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:51,220
that's what I'm talking about. What outfit can actually get stuff moved stuff around the world

669
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:58,820
from places like Afghanistan all the way to the United States or Britain? Do you think maybe it's

670
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:07,060
the government? Do you think maybe that there's, uh, as money being made there? Think about that one.

671
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:14,260
So as I was saying, of course, it's the energy elite who sit up at top and make money off of

672
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:19,460
both sides when there's war. Oh, I'll shit. Now I remember what I was talking about, uh,

673
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:24,260
I'm sorry to be jumping around today. It's that the time quantum difference of me shifting through

674
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:28,420
from nine hours of eight hours of time difference. I was going to say about the Republican and

675
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:35,300
the Democratic Party. That was my reply to the comic strip blogger. The quote that I had heard

676
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:42,500
is, if you look at the new world order, so the energy elite up at the top, then the Democratic

677
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:48,340
party in the States and the Republican party are like one leg each of the huge new world order

678
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,660
because they're both on opposite sides, moving one, the right leg forward,

679
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:58,100
then you vote in the right, the, you know, the, the, the Democrats and then the left leg moves forward,

680
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:02,740
but it's still advancing the huge giant known as, to me, as the energy elite. That's just what

681
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,980
I want to call it. So if it's not about oil, it's about drugs. There you go.

682
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,700
See, there's anything else. I'll say this was on BBC Radio's Radio 4.

683
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:19,780
Um, and it's just basically saying, I see if there's a good quote here.

684
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:24,100
Basically saying the way we're doing it is not working.

685
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:30,820
Mr. Critsley went on to argue that wishing drug use away is folly and that there was no doubt

686
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,660
there would be a fallen crime as a result of legislation that he's saying he wants to just

687
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:40,180
make illegal tax it. The argument always put forward against this, uh, is that there would be

688
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:44,900
a commensurate increase in drug use as a result of legislation he says. This, it seems to me,

689
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:50,260
it's a bogus point. Tobacco is illegal drug whose use is declining and precisely because it is legal.

690
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,900
It uses a form far more amenable to government control education programs and taxation than

691
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:02,180
they would, if it would, if it was illegal. There you go. That's coming out of the UK, but, uh,

692
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:07,140
I don't think, well, maybe the government could and they could go legit, but, you know,

693
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,900
the Brits are up there in Afghanistan. I think they're running the whole drug show.

694
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:16,980
What else are they doing? Rebuilding? What's it about? Are we looking for anybody?

695
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,500
No, we're defending our position or we're just fighting drug lords?

696
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,260
There's certainly not enough information about it coming through.

697
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:30,580
Okay, let me, uh, chill out for a second. Actually, would you like to play a game?

698
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:43,140
It's just young bullets. Hey Adam, there's this number 133.

699
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:48,100
And it's the first one recorded with a Mac pro. Oh, here we go. It sounds good. Number one.

700
00:46:53,460 --> 00:47:00,340
I think I'm, I may be supposed to be for this, uh, young, um, oh, no, number two.

701
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:11,060
Uh, uh, yeah. Is it EMF? KLS? Unbelievable? I think it's KLS. EMF? KLS? Unbelievable.

702
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:25,220
And number three. Damn. You know what? I don't know, yeah, and I'm going to have to give up on you.

703
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,980
And that's it, and all of these strikes are from.

704
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,980
And this is answer number one. DJ, yes, DJ. Oh, summer time. Yeah.

705
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,380
Oh, yeah.

706
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,020
It's summer time. What's and number one?

707
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,180
That's number two. EMF ELa.

708
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,260
That's right.

709
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,940
You're unbelievable.

710
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:35,220
You're so believable.

711
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,220
Answer number two.

712
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,220
You're unbelievable.

713
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,220
EMF.

714
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,220
And this is answer number three.

715
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,220
What is this?

716
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,220
No, you show.

717
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,220
This is simply red.

718
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,220
Something got me started.

719
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,220
I would never guess.

720
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:57,220
You know that I would love you.

721
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:02,220
Yes, I would.

722
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:10,220
Yes, I would.

723
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,220
Start it.

724
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,220
Answer number three.

725
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,220
And hit us number 133.

726
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,220
Simply red.

727
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:20,220
And something got me started.

728
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,220
So, Adam, how did you do this week?

729
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,220
Well, really only two out of the possible six there, young.

730
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,220
Maybe a little tired, but I wouldn't have known simply right anyway.

731
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,220
Alrighty, the answers to this hit us.

732
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,220
And also the links to iTunes.

733
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,220
You can buy the tricks featured on a test online.

734
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:39,220
Or to be found at hittest.mefio.com.

735
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,220
Well, that's it for hit us number 133.

736
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,220
The first one recorded with a Mac Pro.

737
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,220
Sounds great.

738
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,220
With the Ableton Live and Pro tools.

739
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,220
Alright.

740
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,220
So, it takes a bit of getting used to it.

741
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,220
Yes, it does.

742
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,220
Well, I think.

743
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,220
So Adam, thank you for playing.

744
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,220
Thank you, man.

745
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,220
One else.

746
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,220
Thank you for listening.

747
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,220
Next week I'll be back for the next hit this.

748
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,220
So until then, take care.

749
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,220
Bye-bye.

750
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,220
And try to remember.

751
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,220
Think with your heart.

752
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,220
Bye-bye.

753
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:06,220
Be back to test at gmail.com.

754
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,220
In home.

755
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,220
Yon Pullen.com.

756
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,220
J-N-B-O-L-E-T-G-O.

757
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,220
Yon, thank you so much, man.

758
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,220
Always a pleasure.

759
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,220
I know him a little bit behind.

760
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,220
He's already sent me a 134.

761
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:21,220
So maybe I'll be able to squeeze that in on Friday for the footballer festivities.

762
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,220
If I don't fall down.

763
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,220
Let's just get back to oil for one second.

764
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,220
Oh, I was going to say, Yon, by the way, before I forget.

765
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,220
First of all, sounds great.

766
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,220
It sounds really crisp and clear and clean.

767
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,220
I'm not quite sure what it is.

768
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,220
Different processing.

769
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,220
I'm sure.

770
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:42,220
But now I definitely, I have to get around to show you how I've set up Ableton Live

771
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:46,220
with the aggregate devices and the core audio drivers on the MacBook Pro.

772
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:50,220
How I'm using the Fader Fox MIDI device.

773
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,220
How I'm using soundbite for jingles.

774
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:57,220
How I'm using what's the other program here that I have hold on.

775
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,220
This is a great program.

776
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,220
MIDI pipe.

777
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,220
So you can actually write.

778
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,220
Well, here's the way I did it.

779
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,220
I have a little Apple script.

780
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:07,220
I wrote some Apple scripts.

781
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:10,220
And when you do something through MIDI with the Faders,

782
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,220
then you can trigger stuff.

783
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,220
So when I open up the mic, my background,

784
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:16,220
my desktop goes red.

785
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,220
So I know that the mic is open.

786
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:20,220
Right, kind of like a virtual on-air light.

787
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,220
The cross-fader on the Fader Fox actually use.

788
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:27,220
If it's all the way to the right, then Ableton Live pops the foreground.

789
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:31,220
If I turn it all the way to the left, then it overlays soundbite,

790
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,220
which is kind of like a virtual cart machine.

791
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:37,220
And my Omnila Outliner Pro, which has the run-down for the show.

792
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:43,220
And it activates the soundbite, the cart rack.

793
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,220
So that, you know, I can just basically with my left hand,

794
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,220
I can control everything.

795
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:52,220
So instead of switching applications with Apple Key tab,

796
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,220
I can just move this Fader back and forth.

797
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,220
And it brings up all the apps I want in whatever states.

798
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:59,220
You can do a lot of cool stuff with Ableton.

799
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,220
And I'm also using Jack Pilate, of course.

800
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:05,220
That's how much shit I had to do to get this thing work

801
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:09,220
I wanted it to. Jack Pilate is like an audio virtual patch panel,

802
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,220
which is open source.

803
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:14,220
And I think comes from the Unix world, the Linux world.

804
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:17,220
Back to the price of oil for just a second.

805
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:22,220
Once again, you know, although we'll never see the exact discount

806
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:27,220
in our gasoline at the pumps, I think, just based on US prices.

807
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,220
We may go to 350 and we'll be really happy.

808
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:34,220
But this price is going down, and it's not speculation.

809
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,220
Well, actually, sure.

810
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,220
I'm sure that the guys like,

811
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,220
was it JP Morgan?

812
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:44,220
Who was it that was saying,

813
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,220
Oh, dollar is going to be maybe $300.

814
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,220
They're probably long on this,

815
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,220
and they're probably waiting ready for it to drop

816
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,220
down to 50 to make some money.

817
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,220
Because someone knows the energy elite,

818
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,220
they really take care of all of it.

819
00:52:56,220 --> 00:53:03,220
Anxon mobile reported their best quarterly profit ever for a corporation.

820
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:13,220
With a total of $11.60 billion in the second quarter.

821
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:16,220
That's three months.

822
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:21,220
That's like $90,000 a second.

823
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,220
No, I'm in it, I'm sorry.

824
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:29,220
$90,000 a minute during the quarter.

825
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:33,220
And then, of course, the Anglo-Dutch company shell oil,

826
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:36,220
ah, they didn't do too bad either.

827
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:42,220
We're going to profit $11.56 million.

828
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,220
This is a lot of money.

829
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,220
This is a lot of money.

830
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:51,220
I will, you know you're being fucked somewhere.

831
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:55,220
The price is set.

832
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,220
So I'm going to hoax bear.

833
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,220
Thank you very much, man.

834
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,220
I think it's there was a podcast,

835
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,220
Studio.nl, fantastic.

836
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:01,220
Love that.

837
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:04,220
Here's some kind of cheery that I tried out today

838
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:07,220
in a couple of people I know.

839
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,220
And wow, does this really work?

840
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,220
This is a cool website.

841
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,220
The art of manliness.

842
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:14,220
And of course, all the links in the show notes

843
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,220
at dailysourcecode.com.

844
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:20,220
Be it modern night as in a night in shining armor.

845
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,220
Protecting your lady in the 21st century.

846
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,220
And it's really a fantastic article

847
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:31,220
on really about how the media is twisting women's minds

848
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:35,220
into really feeling unhappy about their bodies.

849
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:40,220
And let me just see those a great quote in this article

850
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,220
and it's based upon a study,

851
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:45,220
which shows that while women believe a thin figure

852
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:49,220
is the female ideal men actually prefer a more curvy lady.

853
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,220
Even more interesting.

854
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,220
The story made the front page of dig.

855
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:56,220
And of course, dig users are known for the terribly disparaging

856
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,220
cost of comments.

857
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,220
This is according to the article.

858
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,220
This is not Adam.

859
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:02,220
The vast majority agree with the results.

860
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,220
So what does the story show?

861
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,220
First men like women with curves.

862
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,220
Second women don't believe this.

863
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,220
Third contrary to popular belief men

864
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,220
are not to blame for this disconnect.

865
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,220
The blame lies instead with the media

866
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:17,220
and the caddy expectations of a women's female peers.

867
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,220
Yes, that it's an epidemic.

868
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,220
And I've seen this.

869
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,220
No one guys are sitting down.

870
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,220
First of all, the guy walks by.

871
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,220
And you know, we're not going to say,

872
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,220
wow, you know, he looks like a douche.

873
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,220
Boy, he's got dumb shoes.

874
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,220
We don't say that.

875
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:32,220
We don't say anything.

876
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:36,220
When a, when a, when a woman walks by,

877
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,220
if she's really cute,

878
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,220
we'll probably say, hey, now.

879
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:43,220
You know, and of course, if you're rude,

880
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,220
you'll make some kind of cat call.

881
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,220
I don't do that.

882
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,220
But when women are sitting down together,

883
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,220
man, they've got nothing but,

884
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,220
and this is, I'm generalizing, obviously.

885
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,220
But they've got nothing but criticism.

886
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,220
Look at her.

887
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,220
She's fat.

888
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,220
No, she's too thin.

889
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,220
No, she's wearing this.

890
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,220
That's last year.

891
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,220
You're sick.

892
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,220
And I'm not saying like,

893
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:06,220
I mean, it's sad because this is an epidemic.

894
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:09,220
This is media destroying your brains ladies.

895
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,220
You're beautiful.

896
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,220
I've said this many times before.

897
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,220
All women are beautiful,

898
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,220
just by definition of being women.

899
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,220
And it's true.

900
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,220
And luckily, even though Patricia and Christina both

901
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,220
participate in the catiness,

902
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:26,220
and of course, it comes by what's being portrayed in the media.

903
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,220
The, you know, Patricia isn't unhappy.

904
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,220
And she was telling Christina the other day.

905
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,220
Because Christina, you know, you can see,

906
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,220
you can see the sickness start to creep up.

907
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:38,220
And my daughter is stunningly beautiful.

908
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,220
My hips are too big.

909
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:41,220
What?

910
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,220
What?

911
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:44,220
Yeah, they look big.

912
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,220
She's actually so beautiful.

913
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:48,220
My daughter.

914
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,220
She's a child of the sun.

915
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:53,220
And Patricia said,

916
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,220
hey, you know, just so you know,

917
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,220
guys actually like women with, you know,

918
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,220
that are voluptuous and curvy.

919
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,220
Don't buy this, you know,

920
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,220
size zero crap or even size four.

921
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,220
You know, and it's true.

922
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,220
Chocolate heads, guys,

923
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,220
let your ladies know they look good.

924
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,220
You love them.

925
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,220
They look sexy.

926
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:17,220
And keep them away from Cosmo and Vogue bullshit.

927
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:20,220
Good article read that in the show notes,

928
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,220
a daily source code dot com.

929
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,220
Got some good stuff on the way for you.

930
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,220
Check this out.

931
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,220
Jesus.

932
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,220
With Mac.

933
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,220
Hi, Adam and Matt from Games Weasel.

934
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,220
On this week's show,

935
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,220
we've got a review of Soul Calibre 4 on the PlayStation 3.

936
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,220
Also guitar hero, on tour,

937
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:43,220
we find out what Microsoft's new Xbox 360

938
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:44,220
avatar is going to be like.

939
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,220
And you can win copies of Space Chimps for the Wii.

940
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,220
That's all it gamesweasel.com.

941
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,220
Let's show.

942
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,220
The livin's unspaced.

943
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:15,220
The livin's unspaced.

944
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:17,220
What's it doing now?

945
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,220
Let's put it through your belly.

946
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,220
Who fell away?

947
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,220
Is it called that in Space Bay?

948
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,220
You can borrow my junk for a few luck.

949
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,220
But with the code of Deep Space,

950
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,220
make your nipples get pumped.

951
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,220
Do you use your protein nipples as a telescope

952
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,220
and contact the transmit?

953
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,220
Or the button?

954
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,220
A bit too too.

955
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:38,220
Do you freak it out?

956
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,220
Do you have one really funky sequence

957
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,220
with space to play?

958
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,220
Or do you have several to change?

959
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,220
Yes.

960
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:48,220
The investment grass out in Space Valley?

961
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,220
Or do this move as jetter?

962
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,220
Ooh.

963
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:53,220
We're seevin' John's mission.

964
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,220
Come play with us, Nippeant and I.

965
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,220
The rhythm of ten and four.

966
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,220
I said, be the only man.

967
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,220
It felt very weird.

968
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:13,220
This is the moment to play with.

969
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:17,220
They hear me out there, man.

970
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,220
They just feel it like to play with.

971
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,220
I'll reach it all clear, man.

972
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,220
Who you are, man?

973
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,220
You're signal-free.

974
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,220
Come play with us, green.

975
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:31,220
Come play with us, green.

976
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,220
Come play with us, green.

977
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,220
Come play with us, green.

978
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:38,220
Come play with us, green.

979
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:41,220
All the things we've done

980
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,220
Jump in my skin

981
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,220
I'm a tensioner girl

982
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,220
I'm a tensioner girl

983
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,220
I'm jamming, I'm a woman

984
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,220
I'm jogging on

985
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:58,220
So, the night thing is ready to come

986
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:02,220
No, no, no

987
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,220
Okay, perfect

988
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:05,220
What's that sound?

989
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:09,220
I don't know if I'll have to turn back

990
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:12,220
Who's the craziest thing?

991
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,220
Yeah, I'm thinking it's out

992
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,220
For my honesty

993
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:19,220
Can you say the stratosphere

994
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,220
But we're getting

995
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:24,220
We're too low, quiet, all

996
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:28,220
I'm from no second

997
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:32,220
Now we're in space

1109
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:22,080
This song is fired by a dance performed in Rio Flops on the Underground KC in which

1110
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:27,280
dancers used the series of complex hand moves to entertain their favourite world stars

1111
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,480
as well as the couple models on the magazine vote.

1112
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:36,160
Madonna, the number one song from 1990s in the globe.

1113
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:42,640
So, Adam, all the chocolate, why to know what it is feel like to broadcast on New York's

1114
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:48,480
No one really understands you 100s and more important questions for you to become a dance.

1115
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,600
The hour has gone through the soundtrack to your life.

1116
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,080
Hello, Adam's road trip through his life.

1117
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:58,160
Oh, drop the I-O, slash, ray of jarlic for now.

1118
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,600
Oh, come on, Mickey Ball.

1119
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,840
And if you like it, I'll be back next week with a soundtrack to your life from 2002.

1120
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,280
Oh, come on, come on.

1121
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,080
Hell yeah.

1122
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:12,000
Oh my god, Ray, man, don't ever do that again.

1123
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,520
Don't make me do that.

1124
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,480
Of course, at the time it was fantastic.

1125
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,280
Are you kidding me?

1126
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,640
I mean, I can just listen to that I can hear how much fun I was having.

1127
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,040
But, you know, total tool of the system.

1128
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,320
And for a minute, that was like, oh, man, we'll have to listen to Madonna's vote.

1129
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,480
But I could listen to it with new ears and it was actually here on the headphones.

1130
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,520
I really liked that production.

1131
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,720
It was a great pop record.

1132
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,600
So, even though it wouldn't be a choice, I wouldn't put it on the collection.

1133
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,200
Um, you know, I dug it.

1134
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,000
Thank you very much.

1135
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,080
Uh, 2002.

1136
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,040
Actually, when you start off talking about Christina, you know, when she was born,

1137
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:52,800
um, we had light FM WLTW on in the delivery room.

1138
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,440
And she was born during the Beatles in my life.

1139
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,480
I thought you were going to play that.

1140
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,840
But this was, it was a twist.

1141
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,640
It's a, this whole show has been kind of a roller coaster there, right?

1142
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,200
Oh, let's hit the phones again.

1143
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:09,040
Oh, actually, this is the, um, this is from the drop.

1144
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,560
Oh, I had them, paranormal in here.

1145
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:17,840
Given what we know about the new world order, we have three options.

1146
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,160
Fight, flight, or be assimilated.

1147
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:28,800
So let's see, I don't fancy being assimilated and collaborating

1148
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,720
in the building of my own prison.

1149
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:39,360
I've been fighting, but I found that most people don't want to know, or label you as a nutcase.

1150
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,960
So why would I want to risk my well-being for these slaves?

1151
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:51,120
So not to sound defeatist, but the flight option sounds viable.

1152
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,680
My dilemma is, where should I go?

1153
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:02,160
You can rule out the US, Canada, EU, Australia, New Zealand,

1154
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:04,880
as they're all in lockstep to fascism.

1155
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,560
So where can I go?

1156
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:14,160
To be off the surveillance grid, still have a decent job and a good living standard

1157
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:19,360
and be confident that it won't be assimilated by the bored new world order.

1158
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,440
That's a tough call. Any ideas, Adam?

1159
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,360
Yeah. Oh, and remember,

1160
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:29,600
they work almost at a good point.

1161
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,960
We kind of answered your own question there, my friend, because there is no place to go,

1162
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,560
because they're all working on us worldwide, so you can just forget it.

1163
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,720
So the only true option is fight, and it doesn't have to be a bloody fight.

1164
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:47,920
All it has to be is an awakening, wake up other people, and don't do it for yourself.

1165
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:51,360
I'm not doing this for me. I'm doing it for a Christina.

1166
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:57,040
I'm doing it for your kids. We're going to deal with all this crap.

1167
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:02,560
We have to deal with that. We can make this world a better place, but I do mean it.

1168
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,240
We can, and I'm doing it for Christina. That's what I'm doing it for.

1169
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,400
I can see all the shit she's having to deal with.

1170
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:15,200
God knows if she's dealing with chemicals from chemicals and shit and stuff in the water.

1171
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:20,480
I don't know. You read about it, but it's certainly tough. It's really tough for our youth.

1172
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:24,240
And that's why I'm fighting for her, and I recommend you do the same.

1173
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:31,200
I just wanted to mark something down in the calendar. September 10, 2008, which is the 10th day

1174
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:35,520
of the 9th month of the 8th year, is when they're going to fire up the large

1175
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:42,000
Hadron Collider in Geneva. This is the Super Collider, which cost over $8 billion to create is taken

1176
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:48,320
14 years over 30 countries have contributed and not a single article to be found by a politician who

1177
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,080
can actually explain what the good of this experimentation is going to be.

1178
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,680
It seems like there's a lot of young kids actually who are participating in this project.

1179
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:59,280
It seems like they're all 20 year olds who are all these super physicists scientists.

1180
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,880
And they're going to fire this thing up, and there's a lot of debate about what it's going to

1181
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,200
be, and what it's going to do, and could it create a black hole, and are they trying to find

1182
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,760
the mystery behind the Big Bang Theory? Do we really want to know?

1183
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:17,520
So I just wanted to mention, they did test fire that over the weekend, and we've had

1184
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:22,400
really shitty weather and Britain, and we've had flood warnings, and it's just been bad bad weather.

1185
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:28,640
I'm just saying, you know, it's probably a complete coincidence. Is that typical August weather?

1186
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:33,520
Will we've been having in the UK? I don't know. But they're going to fire it up on September 10th.

1187
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,960
I hope they don't slip at a date and say, oh, there's a delay. Let's do it on September 11th.

1188
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:44,640
That'll freak me out even more. But if I don't go really, really in a minute and a half, maybe

1189
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:52,080
just explain really what this thing is for. And I've heard it all, stargate, black hole creation

1190
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:58,800
machine, but I haven't really, you know, alternative energy. I've heard that when I like that.

1191
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,400
I think it's basically huge magnets, right? So that could be it.

1192
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:09,600
I will find out. But there's certainly some kind of agenda that I don't think most politicians

1193
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:15,040
or if any can explain or understand yet they did approve financing for it, so we'll keep our eye on it.

1194
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:26,160
Read that. Okay, ready? Hi, this is Julia Kribbide. This is Blake Morgan.

1195
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:28,400
Hi, this is Guy David. Hey, this is Julia Kribbide. This is Blake Morgan.

1196
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,800
This is Lee Colter from San Diego via the land on Dane. This is Angie.

1197
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,360
And this is Ryan. Oh, love spirals. Oh, no. This is Christopher Bell.

1198
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,400
And this is Warren. And where from the band, how many?

1199
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:45,200
Hi, this is Randy Jackson from Zebra. Hey, Brent. This is Don La Fontaine. Hey, everybody,

1200
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:48,400
this is Ricky Hills from Keep Pretty. Here, let's a breath rat. Hey, everybody,

1201
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,400
Slaw here. Hey, what's up, everybody? Compton, plain white tea. Hi, this is Jeff Smith.

1202
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:56,400
This is Jaden Olson, that was planned by Miles. But when I was a Kevin Brook,

1203
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:01,760
if I were riding you looked at a pod for radio to enjoy these and other great artists join me,

1204
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,600
Brent Bradley over podshowradio.com.

1205
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:41,600
So much pain. We don't know how to be, but angry.

1206
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:47,200
Feeling facted like we are gangrene. Please don't let anybody try to change me.

1207
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:54,800
Me, just me in the middle of a sea full of faces. Full of faces. Some laughs, some salivate.

1208
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,400
What's in your valley where recycling bins are bullet cases?

1209
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:03,200
It's not equal. It's not fair. We're different people. But we're not scared.

1210
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:07,600
We ain't never scared. It's a paving new path. Make a new street build a new way.

1211
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,320
They can't use thee by the dawns or the night.

1212
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,920
Three slaves on a song's words weren't right. Now when new days,

1213
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,880
common of you stays done. Now while the many are handsome,

1214
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:21,600
your soul is alive, but they want it for ransom. The face promise to anthem,

1215
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:26,080
we step to the heart be some our grand feather, bring swords and rocks together.

1216
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:30,600
We rise together, we rise together, we rise together, we rise together, we rise together,

1217
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:36,560
we rise together, we rise together we rise together, we rise together.

1218
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:42,320
We rise together, we rise together, we rise together. We rise together.

1219
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:46,760
We ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the

1220
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:51,880
Lost, open, found me, ground, did buy y'all so round day

1221
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,720
Did the wall scrape, you know, verse cities

1222
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,720
Or you were not verse the T's

1223
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,360
React on a mannequin, we both were squeaks

1224
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,960
And make 9-11 each emergency, earth to sea

1225
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,360
And put your red, like the turn to lead

1226
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,680
Oh, please let the hurt see

1227
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:10,080
Don't let it happen, people, it's the populace

1228
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,360
We will not to cross

1229
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,000
Don't spare your tights there for my philosophy

1230
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,720
And does not be as sweet, twist the cops and they say

1231
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,680
T's no it's a work, it's a man-comment life

1232
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:23,680
And we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride

1233
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:27,520
And we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride

1234
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,520
And get the pre-line

1235
01:20:41,360 --> 01:21:11,360
We ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we

1236
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:37,540
riding the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the end of the wheel ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride the pedal, we ride,

1237
01:21:37,540 --> 01:22:07,300
I've been seen these guys around, they've got a Newton song out of it, I've seen a song in a video called Handle

1238
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:09,740
bars.

1239
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:15,820
Their name is Flow Bots, without the W. Mynexpects, Foxtrot Lima, Oscar Bravo, Oscar Tango, Sierra,

1240
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:19,300
and that was rise. I thought completely appropriate to wind up this daily source code

1241
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:23,780
with and of course it was left on the drop at drop.au slash daily source code. With that

1242
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:29,580
my friends, I say goodbye to you. Hopefully Friday we'll see what we can do. This is obviously

1243
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:33,980
a show in a half. So the next time I have some time to sit down, I really want to get to your

1244
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:38,380
phone call. So either leave them on the drop, there's a phone number there with a pin code.

1245
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:41,820
You can use, of course you can always call into the regular voice mail lines, but I'll just

1246
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:45,380
take a little bit of time for me to get to it, because I do want to listen to all of your

1247
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:51,580
comments. So until we speak, please live your life with passion. It's worth it. Live it

1248
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:58,140
for your kids. And while it lasts, enjoy your freedom. Another fine, medium presentation. Stick

1249
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,140
it in your ear.
