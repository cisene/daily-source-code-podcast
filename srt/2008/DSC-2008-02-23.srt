00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta-Share Charly 728's The Wet Edition.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
With $16 billion worth of airplane straps by us.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
On casting, it's Adam Curry.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I love me, I'm kind, I'm a baby.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I love me, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I love me, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kinda, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I'm kind, I

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

11
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

12
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

13
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Welcome to the Daily Source Code, it's episode number 728

14
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
a special Saturday edition because I just didn't have the energy

15
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
to bring you on on Friday for a food bar,

16
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
but everything you'd expect in a food bar is included in this

17
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
edition and then some.

18
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No live chat room, no live calls.

19
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I've been sitting here inside the condo for the past 24 hours,

20
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and it has been the most atrocious weather I've ever seen.

21
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We've got 35 mile an hour winds gusting to 55.

22
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Of course, you know, I'm up here on the 24th floor over looking

23
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
the bay and I'm literally seeing debris flying up

24
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
up to the height of the 24th floor, you know, like paper bags,

25
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
plastic bags, homeless people.

26
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's just, it's crazy.

27
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And I'm here all alone and I'm feeling a little bit

28
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
melancholy and I thought to myself, why don't I share a couple of

29
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
songs in the soundtrack to my life that kind of fit in with the mood

30
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
that I'm thinking of right now because, you know, I'm about five,

31
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
six thousand miles from home, and they said it's not supposed to rain

32
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
in southern or northern California.

33
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We've got on board a westbound seven, 47,

34
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and they've been there for decided what to do,

35
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
all that total opportunity,

36
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
TV breaks and we'll be right home.

37
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Sure and true.

38
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Seems it never rains in southern California.

39
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Seems I've all heard that kind of talk to both.

40
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It never rains in California.

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

42
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

43
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

44
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

45
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

47
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

48
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It never rains in California.

49
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

50
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

51
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

52
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

53
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

54
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

55
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

56
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

57
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

58
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

59
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

60
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

61
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

62
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

63
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

64
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

65
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

66
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

67
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

68
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We've got to know that kind of talk to both.

69
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, I think you've got to be at least 35 to appreciate most of the songs I've got lined up for the breakups in the game.

70
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is definitely one from the 70s, Albert Hammond, it never rains in Southern California or Northern California for that matter.

71
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Especially sad because today is the Chinese New Year.

72
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's what Lisa's being celebrated here in San Francisco and Chinatown actually went out for a walk just before it started to pour down.

73
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And they were setting up bleachers and all kinds of, all kinds of stuff on Kerney Street for the route and I feel bad, man.

74
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Paper, dragons and fireworks just don't mix with this kind of weather. It's stormy outside.

75
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't know why, there's no sun up in the sky.

76
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's told me whether, since my man and I, together, keeps raining all the time.

77
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Like this day, you and this year everywhere, stormy weather.

78
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Since my man and I, together, keep raining all the time.

79
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Not that keeps raining all the time.

80
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
When he went away, the moon was given and met me.

81
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
He and these days away, old, ruggin' tears on my head.

82
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
All I do is create a lot of buzz.

83
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Gonna let me walk in the sun once more.

84
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And all I had a life is gone, stormy weather.

85
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Since my man and I, together, keep raining all the time.

86
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He's raining all the time.

87
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And all I had a life is gone, stormy weather.

88
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Since my man and I, together, keep raining all the time.

89
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:19,000
He's raining all the time.

90
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The wonderful sound of Ella Fitzgerald, not King Cole.

91
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Stormy weather on Danny Source Code, episode number 728, from a very, very wet San Francisco.

92
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I've been getting a lot of comments about the new set up, particularly about being able to talk to people live on the show.

93
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And of course, there's pros and cons to everything.

94
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And it's really, for those of you who haven't been listening, I mean 728 episodes, it's impossible you heard everything.

95
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And you may not have been listening from episode one or before we even started counting or before it was even called the Daily Source Code.

96
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But it's an experimental show, you know, we try stuff out.

97
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And obviously, I have the capability now to talk to people live.

98
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's very cool.

99
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And now, of course, we've got to have something to actually say.

100
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So there's pros and cons everyone's picked up on it, but some people love it.

101
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Some people think it's, ah, some people don't love it so much.

102
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
One thing for sure, though, this business of naked pictures.

103
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah.

104
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh, great.

105
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You know, I get no naked pictures.

106
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Just when I spend for them all the time, you sound like a desperate person.

107
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's why you don't fucking get in.

108
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't go in with your money.

109
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Thank you.

110
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Hey, James.

111
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you very much.

112
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
One more like that.

113
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Hey, Adam, let's David and Jackson go calling again.

114
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
They just wanted to give you a little insight.

115
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And I know you're growing up.

116
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I know you probably know this, but when a woman tells you that she's going to

117
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
work on getting some naked trees of it, that means you're getting exactly nothing.

118
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Just a little helpful hand from a guy who has spent the better part of his life asking

119
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
you know, online chicks for naked pictures of himself.

120
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's a pretty fruitless effort.

121
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So right here.

122
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Love you.

123
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Anyway.

124
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Right, man.

125
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah, you're right.

126
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I should stop doing that.

127
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You know, my wife hates it when I do it.

128
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, she doesn't hate it.

129
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
She thinks I sound like a, oh, kind of what to do.

130
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Oh, kind of what James said, like an old perv.

131
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So, of course, we missed the food bar Friday.

132
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I really, I was just too tired.

133
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I was, uh, knackered.

134
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Shall we say.

135
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But I did, uh, no agenda with the Johnson of Orac Friday evening.

136
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
About six, 15 is when we started to record that.

137
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And it was a lot of fun.

138
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You know, we actually ran long like an hour and 10, an hour and 15 minutes.

139
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And I was just wiped out nothing left to say.

140
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And I, I didn't have the energy to go and pull everything together.

141
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And also this time zone.

142
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's a very, very difficult time zone to do.

143
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
To, uh, to taste people to do things.

144
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Because, you know, what is what time is it now?

145
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's Saturday night five minutes past eight.

146
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Look at me.

147
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
How sad is my life, huh?

148
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What, what else could you be doing on a Saturday night at eight o'clock?

149
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I just had my ravioli from Chef Boyardy sat down.

150
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Pull out a whole bunch of tracks from the soundtrack to my life.

151
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And of course, I scan the Gmail.

152
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Because we cannot finish a week without young palettes hit test.

153
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Oncoming casting with Adam Curry.

154
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I Adam, who are you ready to be stunked out?

155
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Because he is the new test.

156
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Bring it on, baby.

157
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's young palettes.

158
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Hey, Adam.

159
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This is hit test number 110.

160
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And we're going to start right away with intro number one.

161
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Take it.

162
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, it's all young.

163
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh, you read my mind, man.

164
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh, that's one from my soundtrack, my life.

165
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That, of course, is Rupert Holmes and him.

166
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No doubt about it.

167
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Number two.

168
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Kind of sounds like like the SOS band or something.

169
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
No, I give up on that one.

170
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And number three.

171
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I know it's easy one.

172
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That would be a bunch of people to keep the faith.

173
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And I'd recognize that intro anywhere.

174
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And times up.

175
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And these are the answers.

176
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, yeah.

177
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Answer number one is from 1980.

178
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I got a signal.

179
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The window.

180
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
There's a pack of cigarettes.

181
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Him, him, him.

182
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What's she gonna do about him?

183
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
She's gonna have to do without him.

184
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's me without me.

185
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Me.

186
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Me.

187
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
No.

188
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's the answer.

189
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Answer number one, him from 1980 by Rupert Holmes.

190
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What's this?

191
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And this is answer number two.

192
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Oh.

193
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Who's human hunting?

194
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
86.

195
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's his host.

196
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Zooming there.

197
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I read that.

198
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
怎麼 him?

199
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh.

200
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Zooming.

201
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Jordan Hammer.

202
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Zooming.

203
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Zooming.

204
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Zooming.

205
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Zooming.

206
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Zooming.

207
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Zooming.

208
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Zooming.

209
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Zooming.

210
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Zooming.

211
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Zooming.

212
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Zooming who has answered number two are Rupert Franklin?

213
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And this is answer number three.

214
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh yeah, from 1992, this is Banjofi.

215
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Uh-huh.

216
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Hold on, hold on.

217
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Let's go get your children.

218
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That they're tied to your feet.

219
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

220
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Hold on, hold on.

221
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Hold on, hold on.

222
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Hold on, hold on.

223
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Hold on, hold on.

224
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Hold on, hold on.

225
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Hold on.

226
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Hold on.

227
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Hold on.

228
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Another great example for the wall of sounds.

229
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Banjofi and keep the faith.

230
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's answer number three.

231
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
We need this number 110.

232
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, so Adam, how did you do that?

233
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Two out of three.

234
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah, I'm Mr. Rita.

235
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Sorry.

236
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The answer is to this hit test and also the iTunes links

237
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
so that you can buy these tracks online

238
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
or to be found at hittest.botsho.com.

239
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Thank you for playing Adam.

240
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Next week, I'll be back for hit test number 111.

241
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So until then,

242
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
have a very nice week.

243
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And take care.

244
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Be back.

245
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Hittest.botsho.com.

246
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Impolent.com.

247
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
J-N-P-O-L-E-T-T-A-C-O-C-O.

248
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And the cheese just keeps on coming.

249
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Another perfect California song.

250
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This is a wishful thinking.

251
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Top-down, driving around music.

252
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Sunshine, and I'm just imagine

253
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
in America's Ventura Freeway.

254
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Where's it, highway?

255
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You're gonna be so good.

256
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Walking down the road.

257
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
There'll be no I long you're gonna stay here, don't.

258
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's on people's say.

259
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
This found a little good in the snow.

260
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You don't care. I know.

261
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You're gonna be a good one.

262
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You're gonna be a good one.

263
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You're gonna be a good one.

264
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You're gonna be a good one.

265
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You're gonna be a good one.

266
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Mince your highway.

267
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
In the sunshine.

268
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Where the days are longer.

269
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The nights are stronger than moonshine.

270
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You're gonna go.

271
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I know.

272
00:18:48,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

273
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:48,000
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

274
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Thanks lots and just the same

275
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That you're highway in a sunshine

276
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Where the days are longer than nights are stronger than sunshine

277
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You're gonna go, I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

278
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Because of free wind, it's blowing through your hair

279
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And the days surround your day life there

280
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Season's crying, no despair

281
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm a gamer in the air in the air

282
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Now, of course, I must remind you that today's daily source code is brought to you under the educational auspices of the organization

283
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
For the preservation, the soundtrack of our lives, but I know it's up-sol

284
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You can find out more about up-sol

285
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Ask her papa's share of Oscar Lima.pacho.com

286
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
In other words, everything I'm playing is illegal

287
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You can't tell anyone you ever heard the show or I'll just have to kill you

288
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm sorry about it

289
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Hey, this is Paul Smith

290
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
From Kingsville, Florida

291
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Here's a little sound for the day's on a 500

292
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm on the backstrapes

293
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And as you can tell, the cars are going by

294
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
This is the 50th running of the Daytona 500 in Daytona, Florida

295
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's not you. Get a kick out of here in the cars go around

296
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So again, this is Paul Smith

297
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Check it in from Florida

298
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
41 Mary

299
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Two kids

300
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Love the show Adam, right here?

301
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Love yet? No homo

302
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
How's the singer?

303
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
She stands up

304
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
When she plays

305
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The piano

306
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And I close

307
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
How's the singer?

308
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
She sings songs

309
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
For the lost in the lonely

310
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Her job is entertaining folks

311
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
See your songs and town jokes in my club

312
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Piles a singer

313
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And they say that she wants

314
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Was a winner

315
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
In a contest

316
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
How's the singer

317
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And they say that she wants

318
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Can't track her

319
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
They played her wings

320
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
On the local radio

321
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
They never made it

322
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
She wanted to be magic rainbow

323
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But now she sits there at the famous date table

324
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Dreaming of the things she never got to do

325
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
All those dreams that never came true

326
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
How's the singer?

327
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
She stands up

328
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
When she plays

329
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The piano

330
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And I close

331
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
How's the singer?

332
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
She sings songs for the lost

333
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And the lonely

334
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Her job is entertaining folks

335
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:26,000
See your songs and town jokes in my club

336
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Piles a singer

337
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
She stands up

338
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
When she plays

339
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The piano

340
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And the lonely

341
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Her job is entertaining folks

342
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
See your songs and town jokes in my club

343
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
She stands up

344
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
When she plays

345
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Her job is entertaining folks

346
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
See your bow

347
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Telling to do

348
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah, I'll be there

349
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And I close

350
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's been decades since I've heard that song

351
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Came across that of my first gen iPod

352
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Which of course is still here at the Curry condo

353
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Works

354
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Spurles a singer on daily source code episode 728

355
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It is the organization for the preservation of the soundtrack of our lives

356
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Edition

357
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Curly educational

358
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And I can remember exactly where I was when I heard the song

359
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
How about you?

360
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I got no money

361
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I ain't that close for my daughter

362
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm around

363
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yes, got no money

364
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But they're always seeing the legend

365
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Nothing to spoil

366
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Cause I'll never see you anymore

367
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And I need you nothing

368
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That's all I'm living for

369
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yeah, yeah

370
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000

371
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But I love you

372
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000

00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I won't let you do

392
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I won't let you do

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I won't let you do

394
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm so shy Yeah, but with you, I just go out

400
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Woo, woo, woo

401
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I just want to pressure your pain

402
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm laughing for one and a half years

403
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I want to hear your cry

404
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I want to hear the pain

405
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You come from me

406
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I want to hear your cry

407
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I want to hear your cry

408
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Oh no, I can't stop

409
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I want to hear your cry

410
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I want to hear your cry

411
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Oh no, I can't stop

412
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I want to hear your cry

413
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
This usually makes us perfectly through the controversy

414
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
From the days before it was fashionable to like friends

415
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I want to be your lover

416
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You know, I've slept around

417
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I've slept around one stack of vinyl albums my entire life

418
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Or at least since my 20s

419
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And it's all prints

420
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Never played them to completely virgin

421
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I got to tell you

422
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
That's probably the guy I

423
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Waffner can't be the guy that I respect the most

424
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
The music business

425
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But

426
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Gosh, do I love the stuff he does

427
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So for those of you not quite familiar with the concept of

428
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
The soundtrack of our lives

429
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
The idea is when you hear these songs

430
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And you think about them

431
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You're like, oh man

432
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I know exactly where I was when I first heard that

433
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And it doesn't have to be the first time you heard it

434
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Because when I hear this song

435
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I always think of

436
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
The time I was in Minneapolis

437
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
The Twin Cities

438
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Manyapolis St. Paul

439
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Of all things

440
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Of course, the Mall of America is there

441
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And I was shooting a commercial for

442
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Sam Goody's record stores

443
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
So they still exist by the way

444
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And so they had it, you know, we're doing the shoot in

445
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
In the Mall of America

446
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And I was staying there for a couple days

447
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And the second night of the shoot

448
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I remember I was in my hotel room

449
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And I was just watching the Tonight Show

450
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Maybe it was a Letterman

451
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And the phone rings

452
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And it's midnight

453
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I pick up the phone

454
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And voice in the other and says

455
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah, um, it's Adam

456
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yeah

457
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Listen, prints wants to invite you to a party

458
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Paisley Park Studios

459
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Are you interested in going

460
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And I said

461
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Are you kidding me? Yes

462
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Says good because the car's out in front

463
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So I throw on jacket

464
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Going downstairs

465
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It's about a 25 minute drive

466
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
From the hotel I was staying in

467
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And you roll up on the highway

468
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Passed the Paisley Park Studios

469
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And it's completely illuminated in purple

470
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It was just phenomenal sight

471
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
You know, rolls up

472
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Walk in the front door

473
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's all pristine white except of course for this

474
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Uh, for this purple glow

475
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Over the end and you got this

476
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It was just so spooky, you know

477
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Really dark and just this purple building

478
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Which was illuminated

479
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Go through a metal detector first

480
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Which was kind of funky

481
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Excuse me and I walk in

482
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
To this room this huge room

483
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Which consisted of it was just a big white space

484
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Along one side was just about the

485
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The longest

486
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Buffet snacks and dinner

487
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'd ever seen

488
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
As a DJ

489
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
In the middle with

490
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You know it's into that typical DJ set up

491
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Actually none of the middle but over to the other wall

492
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
With with speaker stacks

493
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And he was playing this this print stuff

494
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
These tracks that I never heard before my life

495
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It was like this

496
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
It was just unreleased stuff, you know

497
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And I was wow I can't believe it

498
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And the most beautiful boys and girls in this place

499
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
All kind of dancing

500
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And

501
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You know so I hung out and actually

502
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
One of the extras who

503
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Who was on the shoot

504
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
What was her name again?

505
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Um, willow I think her name was

506
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I guess right willow because I remember

507
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
My sister's name

508
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And um, I don't know if she was an extra on the shoot

509
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I'd met her either

510
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Earlier or the day before

511
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And you know so we're talking a little bit

512
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And like wow this is pretty cool

513
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And prints is standing over in the corner

514
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Next one of the speaker stacks

515
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And so I say to Willow

516
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Who I think he actually went out with her for a while

517
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I don't know if it was during that period or before

518
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
After whatever

519
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And I said oh I got to go over and say hi to him

520
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Because damn yeah this is very cool that he invited me

521
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And there were a couple people standing around

522
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
She said oh no no no you shouldn't do that man

523
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Is it well why not?

524
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Oh you know because you're really tall and you're white

525
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I said I kind of bullshit is that

526
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
If he's got a problem with that then I'm leaving

527
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm leaving

528
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So I walk over to him

529
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
First thing I noticed he's not all that small

530
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
He really isn't

531
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Maybe he was wearing some heels but didn't you?

532
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
He's not like a midget

533
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Not a big guy

534
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So that was the first thing I noticed

535
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I say hey you know I want to thank you very much for inviting me

536
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And he knew everything

537
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
He said oh yeah you know

538
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I'd seen that Halloween episode you did on MTV

539
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And yeah I didn't knew about my daughter

540
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And we talked for I don't know

541
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
15 20 minutes and it was just you know

542
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I was but I'm not a fan boy

543
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
But I was completely blown away by that

544
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And and then he kind of disappeared after a while

545
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And then probably

546
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'd say around 2015 to 30

547
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
The whole bunch of guys and black suits came into the

548
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Into the into this white room that we're all in

549
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And they started flashing flashlights on the ground

550
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Just like click click click on and off

551
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And everyone just you got it

552
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It was the signal

553
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It was like the bat signal

554
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Everyone got their coats

555
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Put them on and left

556
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It was definitely

557
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Definitely one of the

558
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
The coolest show business moments I've ever witnessed

559
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And obviously

560
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
A cut right at the beginning

561
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
To the soundtrack of my life

562
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You can try this cowbell out

563
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Let's don't give up night

564
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
To the hardest work

565
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And lawyer

566
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
He's trying to tie

567
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yeah

568
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
He's trying to tie

569
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Oh yeah

570
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Oh

571
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
How's it going Adam it's jersey time

572
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
The official musical just of the chat chat

573
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Hey dude, I know my week off of Valentine's Day

574
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But I wanted to bring you something really nice

575
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
For a football Friday

576
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You see on the positive music network

577
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Is a song by David Martin

578
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And the interesting story about David Martin is

579
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That he met his wife when he was 15 years old

580
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And he recently put out an album of

581
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Ten songs all dedicated to his wife

582
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's an absolutely beautiful album

583
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And he actually calls it the ultimate love letter

584
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I think this is a really really special song

585
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And I think it really really is going to break out

586
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
As a mainstream kind of hit

587
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Check this out

588
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's called Something Your Eyes

589
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
The notes this guy hits

590
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
He's jersey time

591
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'll check you next week

592
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
There was something in your eyes

593
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And now I see

594
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It was your life for me

595
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
There was something in your eyes

596
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And what I saw

597
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Still holds me in your eyes

598
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Spend your life with me

599
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Until the end of time

600
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yeah

601
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
We will make more memories

602
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000

And we will share the stories of the way we want

637
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And I see it was your life for me

638
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:12,000
There was something in your eyes

639
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Come on, it's all to hold me in love

640
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
There's still something in your eyes

641
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Come on, it's all to hold me

642
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
There's something in your eyes

643
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Come on, it's all to hold me

644
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Oh, Todd, man

645
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You did it again

646
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
David Martin, something in your eyes

647
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
From the pod save music network, fantastic

648
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I think I'm going to add that one to my personal soundtrack to my life collection

649
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Cool, man

650
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
That was good, that was really, really good

651
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So I'm going to do some extra work on today's show

652
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And I'm going to find links to every single song I played

653
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And with those in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

654
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So that you can go and purchase them

655
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Because I know what always happens when I play some of these tunes

656
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Just people say, oh, man, I love that song

657
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
How can I get a hold of it?

658
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So I'll put in probably Amazon links

659
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So I'll see if I can find MP3s because Amazon sells them

660
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
DRM free

661
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And if I have to, I'll resort to the iTunes music store

662
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So it looks like the weather's going to be pretty bad

663
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Tomorrow as well

664
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
But Monday, when the week starts off again

665
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You know what happens, right?

666
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You know what happens after the big rain storm

667
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
When the sun comes out

668
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
From behind the clouds

669
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It's when you see the rainbow, my friends

670
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And that is something you want to connect with

671
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And here's a frog to tell you about it

672
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Why not?

673
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
There's so many songs about rainbows

674
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And what's on the other side?

675
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Rainbows are visions

676
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
But only illusions

677
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And rainbows have nothing to hide

678
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So we've been told that some choose to be like

679
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I know they're wrong way to stay

680
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Someday we'll find the rainbow connection

681
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
The lovers, the dreamers

682
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And me

683
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Who said that every wish would be heard

684
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And answer when we should find the morning star

685
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Somebody, follow them

686
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And someone believed it

687
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Look what it's done

688
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So far

689
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
What's so amazing

690
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
That dreams are star-facing

691
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And what do we think we might see?

692
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Someday we'll find the rainbow connection

693
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
The lovers, the dreamers, let me

694
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
All of us under it's known

695
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:46,000
We know that it's probably magic

696
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Can you then have a free

697
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
And then we'll find the rainbow

698
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And I've heard them calling my name

699
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Is this a sweet song

700
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But only illusions there

701
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
The voice might be one and the same

702
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I've heard it too many times

703
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Do it, ignore it

704
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It's something that I'm supposed to be

705
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Someday we'll find the rainbow connection

706
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
The lovers, the dreamers, let me

707
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Doesn't get much cheeseier than that

708
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And I love it

709
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And I'm not ashamed of it

710
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Come with the frog

711
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And the rainbow connection

712
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
