1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Now you know that Adam loves the ladies.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:15,280
He's buying his ladies cars, cinema, exotic trips wherever they want to go around the world.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,480
So all you chuckle heads of the female variety just remember, Adam has a lot of love to

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,480
share.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:35,760
When the DSC 748-20 has for naked pictures, just remember a nice little wink, a cute little smile,

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:44,720
some sexy talk, an old Adam is very, very sweet, and he's pretty safe too.

7
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:52,000
He's getting to be an old man, share the love on the DSC 748.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,560
This is the daily source code, the daily source code.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,160
If you're up to run away, and all your friends always say I'm real, I didn't see him running,

10
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:38,880
and I gotta go, you're real, and still, what I don't hold on to you, you fail to stop,

11
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:54,960
and I get old for him, you messed up, and I get old again, I get old again,

12
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,800
you, you, you, you, you.

13
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,840
Once I'm all with you, and I'll tell you, on the boy I'm big and I'll be unattended.

14
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,240
This damn, it's your Announcer underway.

15
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:23,360
And if you feel up outside, what I grow with your better to you, that's true, I

21
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,260
Can't make it all for you

22
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,260
You've been on the same

23
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,260
Can't make it all for you

24
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,260
You've been on the same

25
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,260
I think you love it all for you

26
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,260
I think you love it all for you

27
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,260
I think you love it all for you

28
00:03:53,260 --> 00:04:00,260
Sometimes when atoms all alone

29
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,260
You need to love right there on the microphone

30
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,260
So here she is, yes, the lady Patricia

31
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,260
The stage you had some better than one

32
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,260
And with this angel from above

33
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,260
There's nothing that they both can do

34
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,260
But make your wildest dreams come true

35
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,260
To grab your earphones

36
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,260
And jam them in my head

37
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,260
And let the fabulous show begin

38
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,260
It's Adam and Patricia

39
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,260
Yes, Adam and Patricia

40
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,260
Adam and Lady Patricia

41
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,260
Yeah, Bonnet

42
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,260
Ladies and gentlemen, episode number 748

43
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,260
Coming to you from the curry manner

44
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,260
And indeed we are once again very proud

45
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
To welcome amongst her

46
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,260
The one and only lady Patricia

47
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,260
Well, thank you for having me

48
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,260
My darling

49
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,260
Hello

50
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,260
So happy you're here

51
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,260
Can you move the microphone a little bit closer?

52
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,260
Okay

53
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,260
I'm sorry about all the noises

54
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,260
Delays and all kinds of crap going on

55
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,260
Yeah

56
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,260
But I would fire you if you were my technician

57
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,260
I don't know what's going on

58
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,260
It's like it's some kind of noise thing

59
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,260
What do I hear?

60
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,260
Oh, I said the door

61
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,260
That's probably quite

62
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,260
I'll kick the show off with the Sarah Borg

63
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,260
Borgis I think it is in the broken single

64
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,260
I love that

65
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,260
In that cool

66
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,260
Oh

67
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,260
Yeah, that just got uploaded to the podcast

68
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,260
Music Network

69
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,260
See February 13 this cool though

70
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,260
Fantastic

71
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,260
I would love that song

72
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,260
And then I see

73
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,260
Can I use it?

74
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,260
For what?

75
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,260
I don't know

76
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,260
You want to sing it?

77
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,260
Well, I need some songs

78
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,260
Oh yes

79
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,260
Are you in the market for some songs, dear?

80
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,260
Well, I need some songs

81
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,260
Tell me

82
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,260
Tell me what's going on

83
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,260
Well, I think we have a performance in December

84
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,260
So goodbye to the mayor of Rotterdam

85
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,260
Uh-huh

86
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,260
And he requested the star sisters

87
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,260
Really?

88
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,260
Among other wonderful guests from Rotterdam

89
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,260
Yeah

90
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,260
Because you of course are officially a Rotterdamer

91
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,260
Oh yeah

92
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,260
And so

93
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,260
Oh, hell yeah

94
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,260
Yeah

95
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,260
May I just say how incredibly

96
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,260
Lucky we are to have you back on the show

97
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,260
Now that you are such an incredible television star

98
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,260
A ratings for NASA

99
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,260
Well, we knew that

100
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,260
Didn't we?

101
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,260
What the year ratings for NASA

102
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,260
Yeah, I knew that

103
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,260
Oh, don't want to do it

104
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
What are we going to do with him?

105
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,260
What are we going to do with him?

106
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,260
Well, I think you should take him off the couch

107
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,260
May we?

108
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,260
That's what he means

109
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,260
You want to be off the couch, baby?

110
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,260
Okay, good

111
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,260
He doesn't communicate so well

112
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,260
How old is he now?

113
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,260
15?

114
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,260
Yep

115
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,260
Oh

116
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
Yeah, that's all

117
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,260
Sit down

118
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,260
Sit down

119
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
Don't go downstairs

120
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,260
You will follow the stairs

121
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,260
So how's the show going?

122
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,260
The show is going well

123
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,260
Yeah

124
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,260
I think we have the highest rating

125
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,260
Not just to let everyone know that

126
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,260
Yeah, you're a judge on Britain's Britain

127
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,260
I wish

128
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,260
Yeah

129
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,260
On Holland's Got Talent

130
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,260
Yeah, which is something else

131
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,260
It is the same show

132
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,260
Only it's in Dutch with Dutch talent

133
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,260
Yes

134
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,260
The quote marks

135
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,260
Yeah

136
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,260
Well, you know we're getting there

137
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,260
I have to say

138
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,260
And I've only seen two episodes and pieces of the third

139
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260
And I have the third one here

140
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,260
The DVD

141
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,260
This is a pretty good talent

142
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,260
That's a real talent

143
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,260
Yeah

144
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,260
Yeah, because we've been through about hundreds and hundreds

145
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,260
We've seen hundreds and hundreds of people

146
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,260
Doing something

147
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,260
I can only imagine

148
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,260
That they think it's very talented

149
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,260
And

150
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,260
And then

151
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,260
So have way we thought

152
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,260
It's going nowhere

153
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,260
Where are the talented people

154
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,260
Right

155
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,260
That's part of the format

156
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,260
I mean you're supposed to say

157
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,260
It's a certain point

158
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,260
Oh my god

159
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,260
Do we have no talent

160
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,260
Is that part of what you feel in Dutch talent

161
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,260
No really

162
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,260
Yes

163
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
So it's true

164
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,260
It's true

165
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,260
But then again

166
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,260
The people who have no talent at all

167
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,260
Are actually the funniest

168
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,260
Right

169
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,260
Right

170
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,260
The ones who think they have talent

171
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,260
Yeah

172
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,260
And actually have no talent

173
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,260
Yeah

174
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,260
I mean that is funny

175
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,260
And that is wonderful to look at of course

176
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,260
Yeah

177
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,260
What's your favorite been so far?

178
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,260
Are you allowed to say?

179
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,260
No

180
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,260
What do you mean no?

181
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,260
No, no, we're not allowed to say that

182
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,260
But I do have a favorite

183
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,260
Really?

184
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,260
Yes, I think I do

185
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,260
But you're not

186
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,260
Are you going to tell me?

187
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,260
No

188
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,260
Really?

189
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,260
Not

190
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,260
That's not a single one

191
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,260
I know it will be fired

192
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,260
Are you kidding?

193
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,260
That's a different show

194
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,260
You're not on that one

195
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Yes

196
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
You're fired

197
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,260
Yeah

198
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,260
Trisha pie

199
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,260
You're fired

200
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,260
Trisha pie

201
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,260
You're fired

202
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,260
Yeah

203
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,260
It must be a lot of fun

204
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,260
No

205
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,260
It's a lot of fun

206
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,260
Robert stopped it

207
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,260
I invited you into the studio

208
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,260
You can't be jumping around

209
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,260
I don't know what you want

210
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,260
He wants to sit on my lap

211
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
Seems weird

212
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,260
Yeah

213
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,260
You hold him

214
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,260
Okay

215
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,260
Yeah

216
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,260
Go sit here

217
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,260
All right

218
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
You want to be part of the conversation

219
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,260
What did you say?

220
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,260
What did you say?

221
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,260
What was the last question?

222
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,260
I don't know

223
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,260
I don't know

224
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,260
Yeah, will you take your top off

225
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,260
I think was it

226
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,260
Was that the question?

227
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,260
I don't know anyone

228
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,260
Yeah

229
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,260
You were so sexy baby

230
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,260
Look at you

231
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,260
Yeah

232
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,260
Yeah

233
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,260
You got your Chanel pearls

234
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,260
And

235
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,260
Yeah

236
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,260
Right

237
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,260
That's nice

238
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,260
That's very nice

239
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,260
No, we were talking about

240
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,260
About the show

241
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,260
Yeah

242
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,260
So

243
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,260
You're not going to tell me who you think you're talented

244
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,260
No

245
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,260
No, I'm not allowed to

246
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,260
All right

247
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,260
But you think you've seen the winner

248
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,260
Do you think you actually know who was going to win?

249
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,260
No

250
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,260
I haven't seen them all

251
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,260
No, no, no

252
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,260
Because

253
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,260
We end probably with six people or something

254
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,260
And they can do anything

255
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,260
Could be seeing it could be

256
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,260
Do you actually know how many people won up in the finals?

257
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,260
I think just about six

258
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,260
And then the people start at home

259
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,260
Start to vote

260
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,260
They can vote

261
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,260
Okay, that's what I like it

262
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,260
People will decide who's the winner

263
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,260
Right

264
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,260
I like it when people let home vote

265
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,260
Yeah

266
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,260
That makes a lot of sense

267
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,260
What is honest?

268
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,260
Well, I don't know about that

269
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,260
But I like it more than anything

270
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,260
Well, they don't know these people

271
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,260
Yeah

272
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,260
Yeah

273
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,260
How honest can it be?

274
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,260
So would you like to do more of this?

275
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,260
Or would you like to work with children?

276
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,260
Children from other lands?

277
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,260
My platform is

278
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,260
I have to say you're really good

279
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,260
From what I've seen

280
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,260
A lot of these contestants

281
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,260
Are young

282
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,260
Or are completely delusional

283
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,260
And really think they have talent

284
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,260
And even though you're telling them

285
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,260
Honestly what you think

286
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,260
You're nice about it

287
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,260
Which is

288
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,260
Yeah

289
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,260
It's tough

290
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,260
That's tough to do

291
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,260
You don't want them to

292
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,260
Demotivate

293
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,260
Is that

294
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,260
It'd be demotivated

295
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,260
Demotivate

296
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,260
So especially kids

297
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,260
It's very important that they

298
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,260
Keep believing in themselves

299
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,260
When you can tell the parents are pushing them

300
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,260
On stage

301
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,260
Well, that's it

302
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,260
I think that's it

303
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,260
Of course

304
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,260
Every child wants to do something

305
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,260
On radio or television

306
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,260
Or hear the voices

307
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,260
Or see themselves

308
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,260
Oh, yeah

309
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,260
I just don't protect it

310
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,260
I dream about it

311
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,260
I have to protect them

312
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,260
Of course

313
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,260
Every child will love that

314
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,260
But they have no idea

315
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,260
What they

316
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,260
They're going through after that

317
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,260
And once they're there

318
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,260
And somebody says

319
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,260
You suck

320
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,260
You cannot do that

321
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,260
Right

322
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,260
When children come home

323
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,260
With a nice drawing

324
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,260
And you know

325
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,260
You don't even know what it is

326
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,260
And you can recognize

327
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,260
You're not saying

328
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,260
You know that's not a good drawing

329
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,260
That sucks

330
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,260
Now you can't say that

331
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,260
It's horrible

332
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,260
You cannot say that

333
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,260
You always say

334
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,260
Well

335
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,260
Something to build them up

336
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,260
Wow

337
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,260
That's good

338
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,260
Our daughter also never came home

339
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,260
With artwork

340
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,260
Well she was the one who says

341
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,260
Doesn't it suck

342
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,260
Doesn't it suck?

343
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,260
No actually we think it's pretty damn good

344
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,260
Yeah

345
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,260
And we thought it was good

346
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,260
But most of the children

347
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,260
Need that

348
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,260
You know you need to say

349
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,260
You jump so high

350
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,260
Right

351
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,260
And they're not coming up

352
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,260
Of the floor at all

353
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,260
Now over there was one lady

354
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,260
And this is now in the news

355
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,260
Who was really angry at you

356
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,260
For essentially

357
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,260
And not just voting her off

358
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,260
But I think you told her off

359
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,260
And she's going into

360
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,260
Newspapers

361
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,260
And she's calling up radio shows

362
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,260
And saying that you know

363
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,260
She has had a very successful career

364
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,260
And you guys don't know what you're talking about

365
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,260
Right

366
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,260
We never heard of her

367
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,260
Which is awesome

368
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,260
Because so good for the show

369
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,260
That's fantastic

370
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,260
Yeah

371
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,260
So good for the show

372
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,260
And she's taking her own whole

373
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,260
Yeah

374
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,260
You know she's just falling

375
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,260
And falling

376
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,260
And falling

377
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,260
I think it's great

378
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,260
I think it's great

379
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,260
I think it's great

380
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,260
Of course

381
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,260
That's true

382
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,260
You're digging your own whole

383
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,260
They

384
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,260
It's a whole

385
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,260
Go over here and dig a hole for me

386
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,260
Okay, you're digging your own grave

387
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,260
Yeah

388
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,260
You're going down to drain

389
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,260
Were there any more

390
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,260
Any more incidents like that

391
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,260
That that you can recall

392
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,260
But still has an answer

393
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,260
Well there aren't people because we don't know that

394
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,260
We don't see that

395
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,260
You know

396
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,260
Just like instant deck

397
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,260
Well waiting

398
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,260
We have here

399
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,260
Joling

400
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,260
Waiting

401
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,260
And he talks to them

402
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,260
And then

403
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,260
Afterwards

404
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,260
When I look at the show

405
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,260
And I'm watching the show

406
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,260
I can see that people are very angry

407
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,260
When they get off stage

408
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,260
And they're saying all sorts of things

409
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,260
About us

410
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,260
Yeah

411
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
I

412
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,260
I didn't ask them to just do

413
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,260
Do you want to know

414
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,260
Do you want to know

415
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,260
Do you want to do more of this?

416
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,260
Would you like to do more judging

417
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,260
I don't know

418
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,260
That was the question

419
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,260
Would you like to do more television work

420
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,260
Would you like to

421
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,260
I mean

422
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,260
Obviously you're awesome

423
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,260
Obviously

424
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,260
And I think people forgot about that

425
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,260
I always knew it

426
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,260
You're married to me

427
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,260
Yes

428
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,260
That's why

429
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,260
Yes

430
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,260
But

431
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,260
You know that I get

432
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,260
I'm enslaved to you

433
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,260
Inventations

434
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,260
For other shows

435
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
But most of the time

436
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,260
I say no

437
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,260
Because I think

438
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,260
Why

439
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,260
Don't give a shit

440
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,260
But

441
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,260
If it's something

442
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,260
I knew this

443
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
So show

444
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,260
And it was a big success

445
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,260
And a great great Britain

446
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,260
And we loved it

447
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,260
We really enjoyed it

448
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,260
I like this show

449
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,260
Very much

450
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,260
I saw some of it in America

451
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,260
I thought it was pretty funny

452
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,260
But I think it's even better

453
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,260
We were actually a little bit addicted to it

454
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,260
Because we wanted to know what happened

455
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,260
Not just a little bit

456
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
I love these types of shows

457
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,260
Yeah

458
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,260
I love it

459
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,260
But how can they do these shows

460
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,260
So I don't want to be a judge forever

461
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,260
Right

462
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,260
Or see sometimes you are a judge

463
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,260
This is my first time in a show like this

464
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,260
And they might

465
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,260
You know, think

466
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,260
Patricia's a judge

467
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,260
We have to ask her as a judge

468
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,260
And I don't know about that

469
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,260
The way I look at it

470
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,260
With the internet

471
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,260
And the ability for people to put

472
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,260
Anything up online on YouTube

473
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,260
Or on Pod Show

474
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,260
You know, create a video

475
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,260
Create a song

476
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,260
You can put stuff on the Pod set

477
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,260
Music network

478
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,260
Anyone could do anything

479
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,260
Yeah

480
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,260
And somehow

481
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,260
Getting recognition for that is important

482
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,260
I think more and more people want the recognition

483
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,260
Yeah

484
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,260
So while there's always been a market for talent shows

485
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,260
Always

486
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,260
I mean going back to before you and I were born

487
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,260
Which obviously is before wood was invented

488
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,260
I think

489
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,260
I think there'll be enough room for that

490
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,260
I think people will be really interested

491
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,260
You know, the

492
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,260
The genies out of the bottle

493
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,260
You know, we now know that there's more

494
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,260
To media and more to music

495
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,260
And more to entertainment in general

496
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,260
Then what we see on television

497
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,260
Or what we've been seeing on television

498
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,260
That's the audience

499
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,260
And the people at home

500
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,260
Want to choose their own stars

501
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,260
Yeah

502
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,260
That's very good

503
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,260
So choosing their own stars

504
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,260
Instead of the stars being forced down

505
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,260
There's throat

506
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,260
Very good

507
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,260
So there could be a lot of longevity in this format

508
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,260
Yeah

509
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,260
But I think basically all you have to do is

510
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,260
If you see another show that you like

511
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,260
That is because you know these are formats

512
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,260
And then they can translate that and do it

513
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,260
And any country you want

514
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,260
Yeah

515
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,260
So

516
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,260
But you're really good

517
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,260
You're absolutely smashing

518
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,260
Oh, that's because you love me

519
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,260
That's because I'm taking all the money

520
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,260
To buy new airplanes

521
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,260
Yeah

522
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,260
Ah, lemon

523
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,260
Speaking of love before I forget

524
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,260
I want to mention today

525
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,260
Is the

526
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,260
14th wedding anniversary

527
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,260
Lisa and James are celebrating

528
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,260
Oh, are they?

529
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,260
Just listeners

530
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,260
Oh, listen to the show

531
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,260
And what's today?

532
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,260
Yeah, 14 years

533
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,260
Pretty good

534
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,260
Yeah

535
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,260
We've been together now for over 21 years

536
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,260
And last night it was quite a stand

537
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,260
No, in the 13th of May

538
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,260
We will be together

539
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,260
22 years

540
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,260
The 13th of May

541
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,260
The 13th of May

542
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,260
How do you figure that?

543
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,260
Well, because I just found an old gender

544
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,260
And a diary

545
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,260
Yeah

546
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,260
And it has all sort of first things

547
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,260
Like gigs

548
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,260
And I don't know

549
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,260
I don't know

550
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,260
This is an appointment book from the 80s

551
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,260
Yeah, it's 1986

552
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,260
Oh, you maybe you could get to money

553
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,260
For that on the anti-rocho

554
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,260
1986

555
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,260
And I just found it back

556
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,260
Because I always saved it

557
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,260
And you can see I have a TV show that I have to go to

558
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,260
On the 13th of May 1986

559
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,260
And that's where I met you

560
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,260
Actually we met you

561
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,260
We knew each other just from

562
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,260
No, no, no, because no

563
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,260
Being a celebrity

564
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,260
Which show was it?

565
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,260
Which show was it?

566
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,260
That's boom show

567
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,260
No, that's not the first time

568
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,260
That's the first time we kissed

569
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,260
No, that was the first time

570
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,260
No, it was

571
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,260
It was the first time we really connected

572
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,260
Not true

573
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,260
Disagree

574
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,260
It was native language

575
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,260
Yeah, but that was only high

576
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,260
And I gave you a kiss

577
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,260
No, that's no

578
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,260
That's when we sat down in the cafeteria

579
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,260
Yeah, yeah

580
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,260
And we had a great talk about America

581
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,260
Yeah, so that was the real meaning

582
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,260
Yeah, but the past boom show

583
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,260
We actually showed each other

584
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,260
That we liked each other

585
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,260
That was the day

586
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,260
I showed you my rod

587
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,260
No, you did not

588
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,260
I wish you did right away

589
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:37,760
Really?

590
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,260
I could have saved so much time at the exhibition

591
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,260
Yeah, you were such a nerd

592
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,260
Yeah

593
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,260
You were such a nerd

594
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,260
I remember

595
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,260
I waited forever

596
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,260
I waited forever for you to kiss me

597
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,260
And then I said

598
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,260
Can I give you a kiss?

599
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,260
How good?

600
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,260
Yeah, close your eyes

601
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,260
And I'll give you a special spot to kiss

602
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,260
Yeah, no, you were not like that

603
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,260
No, no, no, no

604
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,260
I do remember at the pots boom show

605
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,260
That's when you did

606
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,260
You French kissed me

607
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,260
Yeah

608
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,260
For like a second

609
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,260
What?

610
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,260
You kissed me

611
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,260
And then

612
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,260
And then you had to leave

613
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,260
It was like

614
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,260
Take this and go home

615
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,260
Boy

616
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,260
Think about that

617
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,260
Think about that

618
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,260
Think about that

619
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,260
Maybe that would excite you

620
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,260
Maybe

621
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,260
But I had to do it

622
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,260
Because you were just

623
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,260
You can wait forever

624
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,260
I probably would have still waited

625
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,260
So

626
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,260
But besides going into that again

627
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,260
Yeah

628
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,260
So it's been 22 years

629
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,260
22 years

630
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,260
And of course, you get to know someone pretty good

631
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,260
In 22 years

632
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,260
And you learn a lot

633
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,260
And I'm sure there's all kinds of things

634
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,260
You figured out about me about how I work and how I

635
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,260
What makes me tick and what will be tick

636
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,260
And you're pretty simple actually

637
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,260
It's not a hard manual to figure out

638
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,260
No, I read the manual

639
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,260
It was pretty easy

640
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,260
But

641
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,260
Yesterday last night we actually discovered something

642
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,260
Or confirmed something that I'd always

643
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,260
Kind of suspected for 22 years

644
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,260
And you confirmed it

645
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,260
You actually came out to me

646
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,260
And you confirmed something

647
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,260
Which was really nice

648
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,260
Because it was okay

649
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,260
It was okay

650
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,260
After 22 years

651
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,260
I can still

652
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,260
Absolutely learn something about my partner

653
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,260
That even though I kind of knew what I didn't really know for sure

654
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,260
And it doesn't bother me because it just doesn't bother me

655
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,260
So we went to pick up

656
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,260
Christina's car yesterday

657
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,260
You're already last

658
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,260
And I gave you a list

659
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,260
And I lovely

660
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,260
Lovely

661
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,260
Right, so Patricia has the smart roadster

662
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,260
And I said, well look, let's

663
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,260
You drive me over there in your car

664
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,260
And I'll drive it home

665
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,260
Because it has a manual stick

666
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,260
She has a left hand side

667
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,260
Which neither of us had ever driven before

668
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,260
No

669
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,260
Which that's a whole different story

670
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,260
Yeah

671
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,260
So we're driving

672
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,260
And I'm giving you directions

673
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,260
And I say, okay turn right here

674
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,260
And I'm like

675
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,260
Turn right

676
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,260
Yeah, you said turn right

677
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,260
Yeah

678
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,260
It's happening already

679
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,260
Yeah, it's okay

680
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,260
So I said turn right here

681
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,260
And I see that she's not moving over to the right

682
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,260
To get into the right hand

683
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,260
I moved to the left

684
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,260
Yes

685
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,260
And I said, turn right

686
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,260
And he's like, no, you said left

687
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,260
Right

688
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,260
And I said, no, no, no, stop

689
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,260
Turn right here

690
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,260
Yeah

691
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,260
And I didn't think much about it

692
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,260
But it was really weird

693
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,260
But I've seen this happen a couple times

694
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,260
Yeah

695
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,260
Like just now you said no, right

696
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,260
You said left

697
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,260
I still don't know

698
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,260
So

699
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,260
So last night

700
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,260
We're

701
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,260
Before going to bed

702
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,260
We're talking about it

703
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,260
And what she says

704
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,260
Well

705
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,260
Honestly, I've had this problem all my life

706
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,260
And I said

707
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,260
Well, it totally makes sense

708
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,260
Yeah

709
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,260
If you had it since childhood

710
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,260
The confusion between right and left

711
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,260
Yeah

712
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,260
And because it's one of those things

713
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,260
You learn how you learn

714
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,260
I think once it's one of the first things

715
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,260
You learn as a kid

716
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,260
Left and right

717
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,260
This is your right hand

718
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,260
Is your left hand

719
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,260
Exactly

720
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,260
So

721
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,260
You basically came out and said

722
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,260
You know, you have a problem

723
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Yeah

724
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,260
And how and you've known this all your life

725
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,260
And you kept it secret

726
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,260
Yeah

727
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,260
Are you embarrassed?

728
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,260
No, no, no, no

729
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,260
Because I have my solutions for it

730
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,260
Oh, oh, tell me some of the things

731
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,260
No, no, no, no

732
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,260
I'm thinking harder

733
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,260
And I'm saying it

734
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,260
Saying it out loud

735
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,260
I have to say it myself

736
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,260
In myself

737
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,260
Okay, right

738
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,260
Right

739
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,260
Oh my god

740
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
That's crazy

741
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,260
Yeah, and then I have to think about my right hand

742
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,260
And then I'm going right

743
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,260
The white

744
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
It's your way me

745
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,260
So you have to

746
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,260
Especially when somebody tells me to go right

747
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,260
Not when I think about it

748
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,260
I know exactly that I have to go to the right

749
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,260
Could to the left

750
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,260
But if somebody tells me

751
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,260
Next to me

752
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,260
If I'm going somewhere

753
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,260
That I don't know

754
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,260
I don't know the area

755
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,260
And they say

756
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,260
Well, next and then I'm going to the right

757
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,260
You always go left

758
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,260
I have to think about it

759
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,260
Oh, yeah, okay, right

760
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,260
Oh, yeah, right

761
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,260
And what is your little trick there?

762
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,260
So we have to think about it

763
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,260
How do you rob your mind

764
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,260
The hand that I'm writing with

765
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,260
The hand that you're writing with

766
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,260
So that's how I learned it

767
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,260
And I was three

768
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,260
So I'm very good at it now

769
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,260
But sometimes it's just

770
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,260
Not working

771
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,260
It's crazy

772
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
If I don't

773
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,260
You know, put some energy in it

774
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,260
So I immediately said that sounds like dyslexia

775
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,260
Yeah

776
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,260
And dyslexia

777
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,260
I'm of course I've done some research now

778
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,260
Typically that's associated with people mixing words up

779
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,260
Which by the way

780
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,260
When you're speaking English and Dutch

781
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
Everyone's looking dyslexia

782
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,260
Because the structure of the sentence

783
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,260
Literally is very different

784
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,260
Which makes it very difficult

785
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,260
Yeah

786
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,260
But I

787
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,260
I went online

788
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,260
And there's a wonderful

789
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,260
I think I like this

790
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,260
There's a wonderful website

791
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,260
Called the British dyslexia association

792
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,260
Yeah

793
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,260
It's a D-B-A-D

794
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,260
Slexia.org

795
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,260
You can't

796
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,260
Can't read it

797
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,260
And they have a checklist

798
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,260
It's called the

799
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,260
I think I might be dyslexic

800
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,260
The adult dyslexia checklist

801
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,260
Oh good

802
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,260
And so it's so

803
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,260
Let me see how many questions it is here

804
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,260
It's 20 questions

805
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,260
Yeah

806
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,260
And if you answer

807
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,260
Well, I can tell you

808
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,260
I mean, some of them are more important than other ones

809
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,260
Yeah

810
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,260
Or more important to whether you're dyslexic or not

811
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,260
Yeah

812
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,260
But essentially if you answer more than nine of them

813
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,260
Yeah

814
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,260
With the yes

815
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,260
Then you're dyslexic

816
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,260
Okay

817
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,260
Which by the way

818
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,260
As far as I know

819
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,260
Is no big deal

820
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,260
It's being dyslexic

821
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,260
It's nothing to do with being stupid

822
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,260
No, that's not

823
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,260
You're so stupid

824
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,260
Yeah, no, it hasn't

825
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,260
Well, that's the stigma

826
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,260
That's why dyslexia is a problem

827
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,260
Because, you know, here you are

828
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,260
I bet you

829
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,260
I'll bet you a hundred

830
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,260
Well, dollars isn't worth it anymore

831
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,260
I'll bet you a hundred euros

832
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,260
That you've been

833
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,260
You have been embarrassed by this your entire life

834
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,260
Because you felt people might think you were stupid

835
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,260
I don't know

836
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,260
I don't know

837
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,260
I haven't thought about it

838
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,260
Well, you just said it

839
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,260
Yeah

840
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,260
Oh, when I hear people say it

841
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,260
And I think, well, boy

842
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,260
They must think, yeah

843
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,260
He's stupid or something

844
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,260
Yeah

845
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,260
Well, let's see how stupid

846
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,260
I mean, how dyslexic you are

847
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,260
I just like to keep you on

848
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,260
Okay, so the first question

849
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,260
You just have to enter

850
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,260
Yes or no

851
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,260
Yeah

852
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,260
Let me get a pen here

853
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,260
Okay, totally

854
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,260
And just be honest, okay

855
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
There's no wrong answers

856
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,260
And we will not make fun of you too much

857
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,260
No, I don't care

858
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,260
I know you don't

859
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,260
Okay, first question

860
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,260
Do you find

861
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,260
Difficulty telling left from right

862
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,260
Sometimes

863
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,260
Yeah

864
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,260
That's it, yes

865
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,260
Okay

866
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,260
Is map reading

867
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,260
Or finding your way to a strange place

868
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,260
Confusing

869
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,260
Should I get a map?

870
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,260
Yeah, because I never know

871
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,260
Is upside down

872
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,260
Or, you know, how I have to hold it

873
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,260
Huh, that's a definite

874
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,260
Yes

875
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,260
Just say yes

876
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,260
I love this

877
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,260
Do you dislike reading aloud?

878
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,260
Yes

879
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,260
Yes, I do

880
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,260
Yep, you're ticking the boxes

881
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,260
Oh, this is a good

882
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,260
You're gonna love this

883
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,260
I think you're gonna get a perfect score

884
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,260
You're gonna get 20 questions

885
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,260
Do you take longer than you should to read a page of a book?

886
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,260
Yes

887
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,260
Sometimes you sit in your mind

888
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,260
Man, she's looking at that page

889
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,260
Okay, this is a good one

890
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,260
Okay

891
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,260
Oh, this is a good one

892
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,260
Do you find it difficult

893
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,260
To remember the sense of what you have just read

894
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,260
Yeah

895
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,260
Oh, man, it gets better

896
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,260
Patricia

897
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,260
Oh, cry

898
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,260
Do you dislike reading long books?

899
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,260
Yes

900
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,260
Well, no, here's what, is your writing difficult to read?

901
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,260
No, I don't think so either

902
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,260
No, I don't think so either

903
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,260
No, I think so either

904
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,260
I think that's what I think so

905
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,260
But, handwriting

906
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,260
Do you get confused if you have to speak in public

907
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,260
No

908
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,260
No, not at all

909
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,260
You don't get confused there either

910
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,260
No, not at all

911
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,260
This is a, your whole family has this

912
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,260
Yeah

913
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,260
Do you find it difficult to take messages on the telephone and pass them on correctly?

914
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,260
Yeah

915
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,260
Yeah

916
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,260
Yeah

917
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,260
I was hoping you were gonna be honest about that

918
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,260
Yeah, I'm honest

919
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,260
See what I'm dealing with, ladies

920
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,260
Get them in

921
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,260
See the life I have to live with

922
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,260
You should have people living with this lecture

923
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,260
Yeah, yeah

924
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,260
Yeah, so I don't have dyslexia necessarily

925
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,260
But living with people of dyslexia

926
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,260
Yeah, we can have

927
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,260
For you have Tourette, so it's a wonderful combination

928
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,260
Yeah, we should have a super support group

929
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,260
Yeah

930
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,260
Um, wait

931
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,260
Oh, this is good

932
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,260
When you say a long word

933
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,260
Do you sometimes find it difficult to get all the sounds in the right order?

934
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,260
Yeah

935
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,260
Yeah, absolutely

936
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,260
I turn it around a lot

937
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,260
When using the telephone, question number 13

938
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,260
Do you tend to get the numbers mixed up when you dial?

939
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,260
Yeah

940
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,260
Absolutely

941
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,260
Absolutely

942
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,260
Yes

943
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,260
Yeah

944
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,260
Oh my gosh

945
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,260
Do you find, uh, this is, oh, we can try this one

946
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,260
Do you find it difficult to say the months of the year

947
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,260
Four words in a fluent manner?

948
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,260
Can you do the months?

949
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,260
Yeah

950
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,260
Let's try them

951
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,260
Yeah, in Dutch

952
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,260
You can do it in Dutch one

953
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,260
You can do it in Dutch one

954
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,260
You can do it in Dutch one

955
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,260
Okay, so not that hard

956
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,260
No, not

957
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,260
Do you find it difficult to do somes in your head

958
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,260
Without using your fingers or paper?

959
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,260
I'll just put the checkmark right there

960
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,260
Yeah

961
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,260
Yeah, yeah

962
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,260
But I'm going to give it to you

963
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,260
But you're really good at it

964
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,260
Is it sales?

965
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,260
Yeah

966
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,260
You know exactly that's there

967
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,260
20% off or something

968
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,260
You want

969
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,260
Exactly

970
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,260
Yeah

971
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,260
Yeah

972
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,260
Okay

973
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,260
Do you find, oh, this is interesting

974
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,260
Do you find it difficult to say...

975
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,260
Oh, I'm sorry

976
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,260
I'm not in the wrong one

977
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,260
I missed a question here

978
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,260
Here we go

979
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,260
Do you find it difficult to say the months of the year backwards?

980
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,260
Crap

981
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,260
That's, that's even hard

982
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,260
I've never tried that

983
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:07,260
December, November, October, September, August, July, June, May, April, March, February, January

984
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,260
Good

985
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
You can't do that

986
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,260
Do you want to try it?

987
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,260
No

988
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,260
You can do it in touch

989
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,260
Just try it

990
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,260
No, it's part of the test baby

991
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,260
This is science

992
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,260
You can say it in touch

993
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
Okay

994
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:25,260
December, November, October, August, July, June

995
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,260
Is that good?

996
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,260
No

997
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,260
You forgot September

998
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,260
Oh, September

999
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,260
Right again

1000
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,260
We're not going to laugh at you

1001
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:39,260
December, November, October, September, July, August, August, October

1002
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:45,260
August, July, June, May, April

1003
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,260
Do I do that?

1004
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,260
Yeah, keep going

1005
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,260
February, March, February, January

1006
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,260
Do you ever tried it?

1007
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,260
No

1008
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,260
This was my first time

1009
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,260
It was my first time, too

1010
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,260
Yeah

1011
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,260
I've never did it

1012
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,260
Okay, so you do, you do, you do have some trouble saying

1013
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,260
Yeah, it's a special check mark there

1014
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,260
Do you mix up...

1015
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
Patricia Curry

1016
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,760
Yeah

1017
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:16,200
makes up dates and times and miss a point. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. I hear something else.

1018
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,880
Here's one. When writing checks, do you frequently find yourself making mistakes?

1019
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:30,840
No. Not my checks. I'm actually very good at it. Only just like you, I forget the date.

1020
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,240
Put the date. You don't, but you don't like destroy a check once. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1021
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:53,320
Okay. All right. Do you mix up bus numbers like 95 and 59? I never go with the bus. No idea. Okay. Let's just try the numbers.

1022
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:02,440
The trim, maybe. 59 and 95. That's not fair for a Dutch person because in Dutch literally 59 would be

1023
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:08,120
85. I, yeah. Which is 9. I do that a lot with my. We're age.

1024
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,960
True, true, true, true. Did you find it hard to learn your multiplication tables at school?

1025
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:27,720
I don't think I could at it. See, this is what's interesting because you do have the ability to learn certain

1026
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,520
things and just pound them into your brain. Well, especially the very, very difficult things that

1027
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,880
other pupils didn't get, I got it. And if it was something simple, I did it.

1028
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,640
As far as you weren't concentrating. Okay. Let's see what you have. Like Elgobra and all those,

1029
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,040
you know, ask you that. I couldn't do that. Yeah. I was very good. No, I was very good at it.

1030
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:57,000
Really? Yeah. You had 12. So you are definitely dyslexic. Well, I don't know what that means.

1031
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,320
I mean, so I'll just see if that means anything.

1032
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:09,720
You don't have any music? For what? For saying you aren't. No, I didn't. The link with your

1033
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:17,400
show you are definitely. Okay. The lady Patricia, you are definitely dyslexic. I don't know what

1034
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:23,400
it means. Let me see. Let's see what they say about it. I think I might be dyslexic. Oh, that's

1035
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,520
the checklist. So what is it? What kind of people are we? Here we go. What does dyslexia mean for me?

1036
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:36,040
Everyone is different. And so we're all dyslexic people. The hello. Everybody's view before.

1037
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,360
dyslexia is nothing to be ashamed of. Many people see their dyslexia as an advantage. Oh, really?

1038
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:49,880
What is the advantage? I don't know, but dyslexic people often say it's difficult to explain

1039
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,920
their dyslexia. Here's some of the things they say. My brain is wired differently. Yeah.

1040
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,960
It's like my computer crashing with too much information. Yeah, that's what do I always say?

1041
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,000
Yes, baby. This is so you. I know what I want to say, but I can never find the right words.

1042
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,960
Yeah. I see things from a different perspective. Yeah. I have all the right ideas, but I can't

1043
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,480
get them down on paper. No, that's not true with you. Speaking out in front of other people makes

1044
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,600
me stumble and forget what I was trying to say. You don't have that either. Do you?

1045
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:26,920
I write lyrics like, you know, like that. Like Vincent Van Gogh. Yeah, really. I have no,

1046
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:35,080
no problem with that. Amazing. Isn't it amazing? Well, we are special, I guess so.

1047
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,520
It's almost like there's something else going on in your brain. It's too occupied. Really?

1048
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,800
Yeah, a little bit like that. But can you identify what it's like occupied with? I don't know.

1049
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:54,920
The thoughts are coming in and they're probably more busier and faster than also the things that

1050
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:00,040
I want to write down. If I want to write down, I skip words because my brains are already

1051
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,280
past that. Your brains move beyond your mouth. Yeah, exactly. Connections.

1052
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:12,680
Okay, well, I love you anyway. No. It really doesn't bother me. No, but if you see me on TV, I mean,

1053
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:18,760
my one line is okay. So I'm thinking too fast. If your one line is awesome, absolutely. Yeah,

1054
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,160
but that's that's what's amazing. It's kind of like my Tourette's. I can stop it when I have to

1055
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:29,720
perform do something interesting. But I have bad days. I have bad days. It me too. No,

1056
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,840
shit. Yeah, you too. Yeah. All right. You asked me to play a song and you requested one specifically.

1057
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,760
Remember what it was last night and I said, you've come, it's for the last, so last night, I said,

1058
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,640
you know, I wonder this test with you. I'm not going to do what you want to do it last night and

1059
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,320
bad. I'm like, no, I'm not going to do this. Let's do it on the show and then I ask you if you want

1060
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,320
me to play a certain song. Oh, it goes very nice with this, where we just did. Okay. What is it?

1061
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,400
If you could read my mind. Yeah, I know what it is, but you're supposed to like say it for the audience.

1062
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,040
It's Gordon Lightfoot. It's like football. Exactly.

1063
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:22,600
Goes from a wish and well. In a castle dark or a fortress strong with change of all my feet.

1064
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:35,960
You know that goes just me. And I will never be sad for you as long as I'm a ghost. You can't see.

1065
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:49,240
Yeah. If I could reach all my love, what a tale of thoughts could still just like a

1066
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:59,880
paper back in the home, the kind of the drugs to yourself. When you reach the heart where the heart is

1067
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:16,920
come, the hero would be me. You won't read that book again because the ending just too hard to take.

1068
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:40,600
I don't go away. Like a movie star who gets burned in a three-way sprint.

1069
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:54,200
Enter number two. A movie queen to play the scene. No ringing, no the good things out in me.

1070
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:03,480
But from now on, let's be real. I never thought I could act this way.

1071
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:15,800
I've got to say it, I just don't get it. I don't know where we went wrong, but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back.

1072
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:35,960
If you could read my love, what a tale of my thoughts could still just like a note I'm holding.

1073
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:47,400
I'll ghost from a wish and will, in a castle dark or a fortress strong with change of all my feet.

1074
00:36:48,360 --> 00:37:05,800
The story always ain't home. If you read between the lines, you'll know that I'm just trying to understand the feelings that you love.

1075
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:22,840
I've never thought I could feel this way and I've got to say that I'm just don't get it. I don't know where we went wrong, but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back.

1076
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:29,800
I couldn't have said it better.

1077
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,000
Hell yeah, from the 70s I think that is. It's beautiful.

1078
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,400
If you could read my mind, you were just about to say something while the song was on where I stopped you.

1079
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:43,560
You were talking about when you were a kid. Well, I suddenly started to think when I was before I went to kindergarten,

1080
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:51,560
you know, now the children are going, you know, younger and younger when they're going. I had to wait until I was four, five, five, I guess.

1081
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:59,560
And that's when you start to read. And my mom tried a little bit, but I couldn't. So when I saw the paper,

1082
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:09,160
I would sit on my grandfather's last. When you were five, four, I guess. When I was reading, you know, sitting on a slap and he was reading the paper because he was always with his paper.

1083
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:15,560
And I saw all those little letters and words and I thought, oh my, I'll never learn.

1084
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:22,440
This is so hard. And then later on, my mom would read to me a lot. I love to listen.

1085
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:32,040
And she would read all of the story. And I had all those children books and she all, she read it every night.

1086
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:39,800
We were sitting in the train going to my grandmother and I had my book and I was reading page after page

1087
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:45,240
loud. Somebody said, wow. Wow. Well, she's a good reader, especially for her age.

1088
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,800
And, but it wasn't, of course, because I did it all of the memory. I memorized it. I memorized it.

1089
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,040
Really? I every word I knew. I didn't just knew every word. And that's interesting.

1090
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,120
People were amazed in the train that I could read. But, uh, did you, uh,

1091
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:07,800
shrubber the dog is like not cooperating? No. Where you, could you, um, could you recognize if you can recall

1092
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,360
stuff on the page that you knew that that word, like, kind of looks like this? Yeah, well, I saw

1093
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:17,960
pictures next to it. So I knew that when my mom read this and that. Well, that's, that's an important

1094
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,960
part of storytelling. So you actually learn the art of storytelling at every young age, which is

1095
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,360
important for singing. Yes. Because wow, it's amazing that you, you know, you lyrics. I know it's

1096
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,920
your biggest nightmare. Yeah. The, in fact, you have nightmares where you wake up the middle of the

1097
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,320
night and I don't know. And I don't know. And you don't know the lyrics. No, I don't know which song

1098
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,200
I don't know the words. I'd, and people are waiting looking at me. What is she going to do?

1099
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:49,960
And I think I don't know. Did my it way? No, nothing. I don't recognize it. I don't know what to

1100
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,640
sing. I don't know what to do. It hasn't actually happened ever. No, never. Okay. That's your

1101
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,120
nightmare. Well, you can never. Baby, you can let it go because now that your secret's out,

1102
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:03,240
maybe. Everybody knows, but it's amazing how both of us control our severe inadequacies and

1103
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,440
mental disorders when necessary. I'm standing in front of thousands and thousands of people.

1104
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:16,920
Or millions. So no, millions, millions and seconds and millions. But see, it's no problem at all.

1105
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,760
So it just can be anything. Yes, you care. There's proof. You too can be 39.

1106
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,960
And do anything you want. Yes. So I just wanted to share with you my personal feelings on our daughter

1107
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:36,040
who will be taking her driving test next week. And of course, you know, I couldn't get out of it.

1108
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,840
Well, how did all of a sudden a new car show up for her? It just didn't even have her license.

1109
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,280
I know, but she doesn't pass her test man. I'm going to be driving in that thing. What are you doing?

1110
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,640
If he's he doesn't want to sit on the couch.

1111
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,960
He's jealous. He wants to be in the conversation.

1112
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,240
Yeah, well, I'm almost done with you guys. They don't like it here.

1113
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:08,120
In the studio. Maybe he is the sounds. There's no sound frequency sounds. Yeah, there is a high frequency sound in it.

1114
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:14,440
Yeah, I think so. So I have to say, yes, so yesterday, because it really she needs to practice.

1115
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,320
And the main, I can do the main point of getting the car honestly, getting it now is because we don't have a

1116
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:25,320
stick shift. She has to practice with a stick shift. No one has a car that's even decent or running well enough with a stick

1117
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,320
test. So, you know, it's an out. So anyway, it's why I buckled on that, but no problem.

1118
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:37,560
So now we're going out driving with her. How does it feel for you when you're sitting next to your daughter?

1119
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:44,920
Who came out of your womb and is now driving with those glasses on? She puts her glasses on.

1120
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:52,520
Yeah, scary, scary. Unbelievable. They do everything so slow.

1121
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,880
What do you mean? The last minute.

1122
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,360
The last minute. Yeah, let's turn now. Yeah.

1123
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:05,720
But I have to say, she has a lot. She exudes a lot of confidence and she's not shaken by it. That's good. That's very good.

1124
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:11,880
She's not scared. I mean, my mom was a bit scared. She's going to get her big scare. That'll happen. It always does.

1125
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:18,920
Yeah, we've all had it happen to us. But what's interesting for me, strawberry, stop it. What's interesting for me

1126
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,680
is I just went through this a couple of years ago, not five or six years ago, no, seven years ago,

1127
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,320
when I learned how to fly. And it's weird as an adult because you kind of forget what it was,

1128
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,480
you were learning to drive. And now you have someone telling you what to do, telling you went to,

1129
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,720
well, not brain, but essentially, but you know, more throttle or left or right or up or down or whatever.

1130
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:44,920
And I think I actually, I became much calmer by having had that experience and a great

1131
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,360
William with the wink of manners, it was a great instructor. He had me, you know, he

1132
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:57,640
turned me into real. He gave you confidence, yeah. It's, uh, it's rubber. You're going to be dinner.

1133
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:05,080
She likes it. She likes it all the time. What are you doing? I don't know, I'll play a jingle

1134
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,400
while you do that. Okay. And then come back quickly.

1135
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:15,800
Adam Curry was just a guy with big hair who sold his first company and thought he just

1136
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:25,000
kicked back and taken easy, but he never counted on this. Adam and Patricia, the king and queen of the

1137
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,640
manner, or just the lady and the tramp, only on the daily source code.

1138
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:39,080
Okay. Well done. Well timed. Excellent. Yeah.

1139
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:45,880
Anyway, so what I was saying is, um, I feel that I'm actually much calmer sitting next to her and

1140
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:53,880
knowing that the hell, that's, I'm sorry, is that your publishes, publishes, publishes, publishes,

1141
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,800
your publishes, calling and saying, uh, what does it say? Well, you might as well know where the

1142
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,120
text message reads now. Does everybody want to know? Yes, we all want to know. What does it say?

1143
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:09,640
Yes. It is the production company. Yes. Of Holland's got talent, that owns the Friday night.

1144
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:15,640
Number one is twice-wise for something from what advice? Well, yeah, I helping that extra.

1145
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,680
Also, that's extra. Coaching a little bit. Coaching who? Well, there's a lady who sings

1146
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:27,640
opera and they want to know the song that I suggested. Oh, now is, is that allowed? Is that

1147
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,640
how the rules work? Well, you can, of course. Well, but wait a minute, aren't you, aren't you

1148
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,240
giving preference and favor to one person or another? I don't care. If she doesn't, if she doesn't.

1149
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:42,200
I did see her. She was amazing. Yeah. That she was like, must have been like, you know, your age.

1150
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:50,440
Yeah. Um, had a beautiful, like a, a gala dress on. And she opened her mouth and out came this voice.

1151
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:57,080
And as far as I could tell, she was really spot on, um, on, um, in key. What do you call that?

1152
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:07,720
She was, uh, are you saying that? But she had a nice range. Nice pitch. Nice pitch. Yeah. It was, uh,

1153
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,680
I was lovely. She had a beautiful warmth. So what song do you want her to do? Well, I, I don't

1154
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:18,280
I, I have to ask my sister. She knows. She's a classic song. Which is a key thing. Can you say it?

1155
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,280
Can you tell me? I can call it. Can you just tell me what, just, if you were to hum the song,

1156
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:38,840
do you know what song, if you're singing? You put your headphones on your head a little

1157
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,120
just a little bit more. No, no, because I hate it. Well, then let me turn it down a little bit.

1158
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:49,080
Because it's a game feedback. Okay. Oh, sorry. Uh, yeah. That's you. All right. What are you doing?

1159
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,680
I'll ask you. On. So, uh, we are in the middle of a show. Oh, isn't it? Is it here? Here we are doing

1160
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:01,720
up? It's fantastic. That's life. It's amazing. I'm, I'm so incredibly happy that you're doing that.

1161
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,400
Mm. Not. Huh. So that we know what kind of song that

1162
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:13,560
this is what the fast forward button was made for on your iPod. Okay. You were wondering.

1163
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,080
Sing it again?

1164
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:35,080
Is that Andrea, but Charlie do that one? No, I think women, women. But didn't he do that one?

1165
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:40,120
It's not, but I'm sure Charlie. Andrea, but Charlie. Oh, maybe. I don't know. Have no idea.

1166
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:46,680
I think I think that that was a big idea. I think that was a big idea. I think that was a big hit. Yeah. I think so.

1167
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:52,280
No, no, no, no. It's the other song. No, I think that was his big hit. Remember, I invented the

1168
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,440
internet. I think it's something with Bombini, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. All right.

1169
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,280
Full check it out. Anyway, so, uh, with a little bit of luck, which of course is where

1170
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,320
preparation meets opportunity. Our daughter will be driving next week. Yeah. Yeah. I know.

1171
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:12,680
Okay. But I rather put her in a tank with a helmet. You know, and so I know she's safe.

1172
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,640
Yeah, but I am doing good. And I'm doing right and doing everything, uh, you know, what I should

1173
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:23,240
do. I said, yeah, but other people around you have to watch them, too. It's not only you.

1174
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,600
It's everybody around you. You have to neat eyes everywhere. It's funny when I was

1175
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:35,320
going up in America, which was very different, um, because, um, well, not, not wasn't even in America.

1176
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,880
I did get my first license in the US when we were on like a somewhere vacation for a couple of

1177
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,400
months when I turned 16. Yeah. Um, but it was much less of a big deal. People weren't like

1178
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:50,200
really crazily concerned about my safety. It could just be my family. Yeah. But, you know,

1179
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,760
they were more like, you know, they were all things like you know, don't drink. It wasn't as busy

1180
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:01,800
as it is now. Yeah, but the cars were three times as big. Yeah, it felt you felt so safe in them.

1181
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,880
The big cars. Yeah. You were as like tank. I think it's just perception. No, no, they have no

1182
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:14,360
nose. They have no bots. They have nothing. The bag of fun. No. If they have airbags. Yeah.

1183
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:19,800
Yeah. You have a much, much better chance of sliding and more accidents with young people.

1184
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,520
I don't. There's, well, first of all, there may just be more young people. There's more news.

1185
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,320
There's more news outlets to hear. Maybe we didn't hear from them. So I think that's pretty much

1186
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,920
all right. I mean, the thing, you know, the only thing I told Patricia, Patricia Christina,

1187
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:39,720
you get those two mixed up. So look, what you really got to do is just know where you're going.

1188
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,280
Yeah. Drive the car and look out for all the other fucking idiots. That's really all.

1189
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:49,880
I know screaming kids in your car that I was like, well, the kids don't like that. They are

1190
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,760
much cooler. I remember even when I had first had my license, we never did that shit.

1191
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,280
We're not going to do. No, no, no. No, we were all pretty cool. Even though we were a

1192
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:04,920
rowdy bunch, we were pretty cool about that. Because we, you know, no, I disagree. But what could

1193
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:10,200
happen, I told us, if you don't feel fit to drive for whatever reason, do not have someone else

1194
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:16,120
drive you. No, no, you call me no matter where you are. I will come and get you no questions asked,

1195
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:22,360
no repercussions, just that's the agreement. I, you know, that's it. No, no speech, no, nothing,

1196
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:28,200
just call me and I'll come and, and I promise you, I'll be happy. I'll be proud of you that

1197
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:34,280
you might ask her, what's going on? But that's how the system works. I make that big process and

1198
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,840
then you go in with the knives and daggers. I'm the one that's going to get up at three in the

1199
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:45,320
morning and go get her when she's tank somewhere. What she didn't until now? No, never, never.

1200
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:51,800
I've never seen her any breathing. No, no, no, no. I think she doesn't like the feeling of being

1201
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:57,640
well, neither do we. I mean, she is a total product of us, total product. Yeah, I don't like it either.

1202
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:04,200
I like to be in control. Hell is. Stay in control. Hell, yeah. Yeah. Okay. What are you controlling me to

1203
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:13,880
do now? Uh, I need to go to hell. I examine. Yeah. And I examine. Yeah. To see how my eyes are doing right now,

1204
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:20,200
because I need some new glasses. Because I use my glasses on TV. I'm going to need them pretty soon.

1205
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,760
So I need good ones. Beautiful. I need by-focals actually. Can you believe that?

1206
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,640
Ah, yeah, you do. Yeah. I heard you. Because it's either that or it. Because yeah.

1207
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:36,600
Oh, this is the age. Yeah. You know, you cannot focus. This is my moment. Yeah. This is the moment.

1208
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:42,200
So I'm having my physical done on Saturday. My medical. Yep. Which is for insurance for my

1209
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,760
pilot's license. But it also kind of tell me also longs and every time. Longs, heart, eyes,

1210
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:52,920
testicles. Yeah. Everything. Blow, blow, blow. Yeah. Exactly. That's what the doctor said.

1211
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:59,320
No, it's cough. Oh, cough. It's low. It's low. If the doctor says, blow to me, I'm running away.

1212
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:07,560
It's actually, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's the guy who opened up the whole fucking cardiology

1213
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:16,840
way. Yeah. Right. When you had your, uh, attack. So, uh, yeah. I can't really at it. It wasn't an attack,

1214
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:22,600
but I had my moment. You had your moment, the gas moment. Darling, thank you so much for coming

1215
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:27,080
on the program. It was nice. Is it the light? It's been way too long. It's a great show. So it's a

1216
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:32,280
love to be. You're just talking. Now, that's, now that hurts me. You don't know. It's a great

1217
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:38,360
show because everybody's talking about it. Everywhere I go, even when I get my, my suitcase of the

1218
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:47,000
carousel. Yeah. And, uh, get with, get with, get with. Yeah. You know, guys, uh, hey, um, aren't you

1219
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,560
lady betraying? You betray, yeah. That was a Dutch guy. Yeah. So he recognized me. What he said,

1220
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:58,840
I was just listening to Adam. I love his show. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. He was just listening to you.

1221
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:06,200
Hmm. And other people in Holland. But you don't listen to him. Well, you know, I have other

1222
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:11,240
things to do. What if I'm listening to you the whole day? I already listened to you to other things

1223
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:19,320
for you. You're bored enough of me just here. You're bored enough? No, no, no, no, no. Anyway,

1224
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:25,320
so we're going on a little trip next week. Uh, next Thursday, we're appearing on, uh, I got the, uh,

1225
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:31,240
the producer sent me. Yeah. I saw a Yenset, which is, uh, which is a, uh, it's not a daily talk show.

1226
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,360
Yes. No, that he's daily. I didn't know that. I thought it was three times a week, but it's

1227
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:39,880
five days a week. Oh, wow. Really. Yeah. And it's kind of like he's a cross between Letterman

1228
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:46,280
and Leno. I would say. But then a little bit, I, yeah. I think so. But we've known him for a long

1229
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:52,840
time. And I love you. And younger than, yeah. But he's very funny. And I think he has our humor.

1230
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,400
Yeah. To say the live. We all the last time we did the show. He's on the edge now and there,

1231
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:03,240
but I really like that. So I'm sure they're going to cook. I'll cook all kinds of stupid shit.

1232
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,920
Yeah. Yeah. I'm, uh, uh, Jerry. So that'll be Thursday next week. But you're afraid to go by yourself.

1233
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:14,280
I know. I'm deathly afraid. I know. Because I'm not funny. I'm with you. I'm, uh, then it's fun, you know,

1234
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,080
because then I'm not worried. This is, you know, I can just, you always very relaxed when you're

1235
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,960
sitting next to me on couch on TV and I think, wow, he's so really dead. It's because I'm there.

1236
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,880
Because I know that no matter what happens, you'll, you'll, I'm right behind you. Yeah.

1237
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:34,120
I'm right behind you, baby. You'll take on the shrapnel. The shrapnel. You'll take,

1238
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,280
you'll take the bullet. I know you're good at it. But you also boom, you, you parry back immediately.

1239
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,520
Did you ever tell them that something happened around the house in America?

1240
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,080
We'll tell them. We'll tell them. We'll tell them this time. Yeah. That's fine. I don't care.

1241
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,760
Yeah, okay. On this show, you want to fill on TV? Yeah, no, no.

1242
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:55,160
Well, it's, okay, there's two perspectives on this story, okay? So there was,

1243
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,680
we were in New Jersey and there was some kind of racket outside.

1244
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:03,640
Something very strange. It was very, it was dark. It was, uh, in the middle of the night.

1245
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,840
And something was actually going out in suburban New Jersey where we had a house like,

1246
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:14,520
you could hear somebody walk around the house. Yeah. So I said,

1247
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:20,840
let's have a look. And then wait a minute. I got my shotgun. Got your shotgun. Yeah. We opened

1248
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:29,800
the door. You said to me, you go. I'm right behind you. Wait a minute. And I go with my flashlight.

1249
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:35,880
And you're right behind me. And he let me. Let's go first. Let me just say that's not entirely how

1250
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:42,600
it happened. I was literally right behind you. But I had the shotgun in front of you. No,

1251
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:49,560
Yes, I did. I had the shotgun pointing out in front of you. How old are you? In your dreams.

1252
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:56,680
It's not. I, uh, I was whimpy. And I did notice it later, I thought. What a day. What was that?

1253
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:04,200
I was saying front. Well, so that I could, I could shoot the guy, if he shot me. Yeah. But

1254
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:09,960
I'm in front of you. Yeah, I'm very good. And what was it, a scunk? It was a big scunk. Yeah.

1255
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:15,160
Good. I should have blasted that fucker out of this car. Oh, no. Oh, it's so beautiful.

1256
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:19,160
All right, my darling. But anyway, you have to be a person.

1257
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,960
No, so far we're doing this. We're good. We're good.

1258
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,560
All right, I appreciate you coming on being so open on us. I'm sure you've helped a lot of people who are

1259
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,960
to the test with you. I mean, I'm very successful. Don't be shy. It just goes to show.

1260
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:37,560
It just goes to show. Nothing to do with it. And you're not dumb. You just have problems with left and right.

1261
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,320
Well, I can't be dumb now. But so does everybody. Oh, yeah.

1262
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:48,040
Oh, yeah. All right, darling. Well, thank you, dear. I'm going now. Okay. Hey, huh? Yeah.

1263
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:54,440
Live life with passion. Yes, I will. And enjoy your freedom. Yes. See, you don't even know. I say that every time I'm in the show.

1264
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:59,720
Do you? You do. I know you do. All right, everybody. You've got it for me, probably.

1265
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,360
Live life with passion. Tony Robbins, actually. Oh, what?

1266
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:12,120

1267

Okay. We need you on the show a little more. All right. All right.
