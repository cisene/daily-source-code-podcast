1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,720
And he's saying that a debate is now needed on how far Britain should go and identifying

2
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,240
potential offenders, given that some experts believe it is possible to identify future

3
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,400
offending traits in children as young as five years old. We have to find who are possibly going

4
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,160
to be the biggest threat to society and kill them and incarcerate them. You have bad DNA,

5
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,240
you five-year-old child.

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:56,240
It's not a new work for us. We can live in our item whenever they're gone, maybe.

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,240
So really, so now we can tell the DNA that you're a bad person.

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,240
This is spot for us. We know it. They're going to come from your children.

9
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,240
So this of course is my call once again that I think we need to stand up and protest.

10
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,240
Oh wait a minute, you're not allowed to protest without a license in the UK.

11
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,240
Hmm, I'm sorry. No, no one's interested. I'm certainly ready for it.

12
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,240
Catch you, you bloody shit.

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,800
Friends, you will prove that in all of a sudden we have hundreds of people up here with these

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,240
t-shirts and then we've been five minutes prone. We all dispersed before the cops can do anything.

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,240
You will. You won't have to ask.

16
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,240
You want to rock a roll man? You want to have some fun?

17
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
We can never do it.

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,240
Live your life with passion and whatever you do while it's still less.

19
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,240
Enjoy your freedom.

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,240
Oh, $16 million worth of airplane strap to my ass.

21
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,240
Do the next generation radio content in my ears.

22
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,240
We don't need lost digging trees in.

23
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,240
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,240
Casting is a matter of curry.

25
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,240
You are listening to a man willing to stand up and say, you work for me.

26
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,240
And then sit back down and wait for the TSA to return his pants.

27
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,240
It's Adam Curry in the DSC 736.

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,240
Let me sit back and count away.

29
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,240
See the shit.

30
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
See the shit.

31
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240
Three.

32
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
See the shit.

33
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,240
I love my bitch.

34
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
I love my bitch.

35
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,240
I love my bitch.

36
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,240

I love my bitch.

121
00:04:33,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Oh, my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my

123
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
I'm in the spin I'm seeing

124
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
I'm just shaking

125
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
I'm just my cheek

126
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
I'm just shaking

127
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
I see the sea

128
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
I'm like

129
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
I'm not gonna let it down

130
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
I admittedly I never expected to hear

131
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Martha and the muffins mash up

132
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
But there you have a DJ LaClawn

133
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
And wearing a big red mashed up nose

134
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
With this one mad

135
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Loved this song

136
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
It's called Echo Bitch

137
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
I made a spell for you

138
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Echo Keato Oscar

139
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Bravo Inia Tango

140
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Charlie Hotel

141
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Makes sense, not met

142
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Wow

143
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
That was

144
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Oh man

145
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
That was awesome

146
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
And I was thinking

147
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Well, I'm listening to the song

148
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
How good is it?

149
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
These mashups

150
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
It's so good

151
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
It really belongs in

152
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Opsol

153
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
I have to say

154
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
It's under the educational auspices

155
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
This is

156
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
I think it really has to be considered

157
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Fair use at this point

158
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
To mash up songs

159
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Because

160
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Look at what we're introducing

161
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
People too

162
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
So you heard

163
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Buster Rimes of course

164
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
My daughter would recognize

165
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Buster Rimes

166
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
She know Martha and the muffins

167
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
I don't know for sure

168
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Does she know Echo Beach

169
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Of course the

170
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
The original that this was based on

171
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
Probably not

172
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Although she is in quite an 80s vibe

173
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
These days I heard it

174
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Listening to a lot of 80s tracks

175
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Probably source to seekpod.com

176
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Also in this mashup

177
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Emma Peel of course from the Avengers

178
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
And I thought I heard some

179
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Uma Thurmond in there as well

180
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Man, fantastic

181
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
DJ LaClawn

182
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
You rocking and rolling my brother

183
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Hey everybody

184
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Welcome

185
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
This was code episode number 736

186
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Coming to you from a rainy

187
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Guilford

188
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
We're on the west side of

189
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
G-town in the affluent subversory

190
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Up here in

191
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
In the attic

192
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
At the curry manner

193
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
And

194
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Wow big score yesterday

195
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Yesterday show the story

196
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
That I shared with you guys

197
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
About

198
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
The director of

199
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Forensic Sciences for the

200
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Scotland Yard's name is Gary

201
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Well it's

202
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
It's built

203
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Pop a uniform golf hotel

204
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
So it's either pew

205
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Or

206
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
I think I'll keep it

207
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Pa

208
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
I just got to read this again

209
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
He is the new DNA spokesman

210
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
I'm sorry

211
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Along with

212
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
The new

213
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
My director

214
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
No he is the new DNA spokesman

215
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
For the Association of Chief Police

216
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Officers

217
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Said that a debate was needed on how far

218
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Britain should go and identifying

219
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Potential offenders

220
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Given that some experts

221
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Believe it is a possibility to

222
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Identify future

223
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Offending traits in children

224
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
As young as five years of age

225
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
So this of course

226
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
In my mind

227
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Is nothing different

228
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
From cameras

229
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Looking for suspicious

230
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Behaviour

231
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Or turning each other

232
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Against each other

233
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
To seek you out

234
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
And make sure that

235
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
If you're acting suspicious

236
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
That you're reported

237
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
And for people like me

238
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Who in general

239
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
I'm just not likeable

240
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Guys

241
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
This is very scary business

242
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
So the whole idea of

243
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Thought crimes

244
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Coming in

245
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Not just a thought crime

246
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
But a genetic

247
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Possibility that you will

248
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Actually commit a crime

249
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Is an outrageous thought

250
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Even the lady Patricia went off on this one

251
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
And she's all four

252
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Millions of cameras looking at us

253
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Let me just see if I can find

254
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Another one of these nice nuggets

255
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,200
From this article here

256
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Where was it?

257
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
A recent report here

258
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
From the Think Tank Institute

259
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Public Policy Research

260
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Called for children to be targeted

261
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Between the ages of five and twelve

262
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
With cognitive behavioral therapy

263
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Parenting programs

264
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
An intensive support

265
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Prevention should start young

266
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
It's said

267
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Because prolific offenders

268
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Prolific offenders

269
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Typically began

270
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Offending between the ages of ten and thirteen

271
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
So if we identify them young

272
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,200
We can still shape their minds

273
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
So you can imagine I got some feedback

274
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
On this puppy

275
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Some good ones too

276
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
I'm just waiting here

277
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Just a little thought

278
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I told you anything

279
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
I was just finally got a little pasted

280
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
I mean I should be shutting myself up

281
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
But just a little question

282
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Did I have five girls

283
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
In terms of the professor really

284
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
You know, screaming about four times

285
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
I think each other would tend to

286
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Really need to be locked up

287
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
We need to do a post five year old

288
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Analysis on your Chris laden

289
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
I think you should be eliminated

290
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
From society

291
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,200
You are clearly a horrible five year old

292
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Stabbing each other with pencils

293
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Indeed

294
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Showing behavior, refusal, criminal

295
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
You must be put to death

296
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
That they can't be

297
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Any genetic trait that says

298
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
The five year old

299
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Is going to become a criminal

300
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,200
You know, the next adult Hitler

301
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
There's nothing they can say

302
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
That because surely

303
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
And research shows again and again

304
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
The game is psychology

305
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
And psychiatry

306
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
The thing is

307
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
The thing is

308
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
It's surrounding the nature of you

309
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
I'm not saying you do ethics

310
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
I mean, there is something the same

311
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
In this case

312
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
I don't think Louzo wrote

313
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
His arm art and children

314
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
But that's fucked up

315
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
That's fucked up

316
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
That's really fucked up

317
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Thank you

318
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
My name

319
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Now I Chris

320
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Chris is a university by the way

321
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Smart kid

322
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Yeah, he's podcasting

323
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
His way to university

324
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Apparently

325
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
The money we pay him is actually

326
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Helping him out

327
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
So proud of that

328
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
And I appreciate the feedback

329
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
There Chris

330
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Yeah, but you know, this is very much like

331
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Well, life imitates aren't often right

332
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Who sent this to me Mike Felderboro

333
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
I said he was listening to the show

334
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Yesterday about the DNA testing of five year olds

335
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
And you said it may be think of a couple of movies

336
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
In particular

337
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
A movie I watched a couple of months back

338
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
I guess at some point this is what will happen

339
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
To inferior or bad DNA

340
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
I've seen this movie

341
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
It's called Gatica

342
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Gatica is a very futuristic

343
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
It's kind of tough to get through

344
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Unless you're really stone

345
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Or really into it

346
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,200
But it's exactly this man

347
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Because the next piece

348
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
It's just like you write

349
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Just like Adolf Hitler

350
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Is to brand people who have

351
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Inferior quality or inferior DNA

352
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
He did that of course with the

353
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
The star of David

354
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,200
And later in concentration camps with tattooed numbers

355
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Mike also goes on to say it

356
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Reminds me also the beef of endeta movie

357
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Where the government doesn't work for us anymore

358
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Yeah, of course

359
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,200
We've talked about that movie in great detail

360
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
You're absolutely right Mike

361
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
I'm right there with you

362
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,200
It's life imitating art

363
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
That's what's going to happen next

364
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
I'm telling you this is just so

365
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
This is the cameras

366
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
We're so used to it

367
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
I guess no one's really jumping up and down

368
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Too much to do something about it

369
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Although do I do have a call

370
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Coming up in a moment

371
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
But even James

372
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Who was pretty much

373
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Telling me that I should shut up

374
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
No one's watching us

375
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
I mean James

376
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,200
If you don't believe the cameras are watching us

377
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
And trying to catch us doing bad things

378
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
How do you feel about

379
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
This DNA testing

380
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
And please James

381
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Don't sugar code

382
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Adam, James

383
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Um

384
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
I'm cute

385
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
We all got you

386
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Logo whatever he is

387
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
The DNA

388
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
You can fuck right off

389
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
He's not a make it stay in it

390
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
But not a chance

391
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Um

392
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Sure

393
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
The wood is a bad

394
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Get people are pretty supposed to crane

395
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Um

396
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
This is mostly I don't know you've listened

397
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
And I'll make some red freaking on this

398
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
People are pretty supposed to crane

399
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Because they're all free

400
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
So nobody's going to be in front of me

401
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Before you completely destroyed barrens

402
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Bangwood

403
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Or did you got his DNA

404
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Or did you got some scruffy little oik

405
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Where next people's bikes

406
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
When he's 12

407
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
They can fuck right off

408
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Then I might get to the DNA

409
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Show me a spike

410
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Alright James

411
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Well that's

412
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
That's my point kind of you know

413
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
It's like

414
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
What's the difference between the government

415
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Saying that they can actually tell if you're bad

416
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Because of your DNA

417
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Or what's the difference between that

418
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
And um

419
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Let's see

420
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Them lying about going to Iraq

421
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
They certainly fooled America

422
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Fooled the United Kingdom

423
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Didn't they?

424
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
How about global warming

425
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Are you absolutely sure?

426
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Absolutely 100% sure

427
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
That what they say is happening is actually taking place

428
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Or is there some ulterior motive behind that

429
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Maybe money

430
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
To fund all kinds of green projects

431
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
And by the way

432
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
You don't hear much about that

433
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
These days not the economy is shit

434
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Because the central bankers are tanking everything

435
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Taking money out of your pocket

436
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Saving their own hides at your expense

437
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
How about cameras?

438
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Well you know he looked kind of

439
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
He had a backpack on you know he looks suspicious

440
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
And so we shot the fucker five times

441
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
What's the difference?

442
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
What is the difference I ask you?

443
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,200
These people work for us in the government

444
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
All governments but since I'm here in the UK

445
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Let's talk about the British government

446
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
They work for us

447
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
They need to listen to us

448
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Look at our neighbors

449
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Across the water

450
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Look at the French

451
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
When they don't agree with something

452
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
They let it be known

453
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
You know

454
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
They've taken the violent route

455
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
It does seem to work

456
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
I don't think we need to do that

457
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
I think here in Britain we are

458
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Despite what the French may think

459
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
I think we are more sophisticated

460
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
But perhaps we've taken it a bit too far

461
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Perhaps we're a little bit too proper

462
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
I think we need to make a stand

463
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
This is out

464
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Effing Rages

465
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Who is to say that this DNA stuff

466
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Really works that you can really prove

467
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
That someone is going to be

468
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Well

469
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
I mean

470
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
A criminal

471
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
Sex Offender

472
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
You know

473
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
And then they start putting that in your documentation

474
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
On your IDs

475
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Right

476
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
The National ID card

477
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
That is a huge debate here in the United Kingdom

478
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
All it takes is just

479
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
One little

480
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Checkbox on the paperwork

481
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
And it says

482
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Well, it could be a future criminal

483
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
In fact, I gave this to put this example to Patricia yesterday

484
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
I said

485
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
You watch

486
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
I guarantee you

487
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
In our lifetime

488
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
You will see the following happen

489
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
You will see

490
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Because when we moved here

491
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
I said no credit cards

492
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
No mobile

493
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
You know

494
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
Prepaid only

495
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
I want to live off the grid as much as possible

496
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Well

497
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
So what does she do?

498
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
She goes out she gets a nectar card

499
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Now for those in the UK you know what a nectar card is

500
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
A nectar card essentially

501
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Forces you

502
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Into using it

503
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Because they'll give you all kinds of great discounts

504
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
As long as you continue to use the nectar card

505
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,200
And what happens is it's a loyalty card right

506
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
So upon checkout

507
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
And she uses it almost exclusively

508
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
It's saying spares

509
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Where we do a lot of our big shopping

510
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
And so she'll plunk it down

511
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Just before she pays

512
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
And it affects the amount of the bill

513
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
And it can be

514
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
10, 20

515
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Sometimes it's you know 30 of 40 pounds off of the bill

516
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
It's an amazing amount of money

517
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
You say

518
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
If you don't use it of course

519
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
You don't get those discounts

520
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
And my wife is fruit

521
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Well she loves discounts

522
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
She loves a bargain

523
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,200
But what she's not really

524
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Realizing is it's a trap

525
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,200
It's a system where they continue to look at what you're buying

526
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,200
And they make sure you come back for the best price to buy it

527
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
With that

528
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Now that's all fine

529
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
So the next step of course

530
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Is that they somehow this data

531
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
And I think we have a couple examples

532
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Here in the UK of data getting this place lost

533
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Or just mishandled

534
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Carelessly mishandled

535
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
But it could even be an official thing

536
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
The government could say

537
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
If whatever reason tomorrow

538
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
They wake up and say okay

539
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Nector Card owners

540
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
We need all of your data

541
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
And here's what I guarantee you

542
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
We will see happen

543
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
In our lifetime

544
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,200
They will say you know what

545
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,200
We've noticed that you've been buying too many fatty foods

546
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,200
So we're going to up the premium on your insurance

547
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Because well Mrs. Curry

548
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
We know you have a pre-existing heart condition

549
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,200
And you know the insurance company is not happy

550
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
With you not taking care of yourself

551
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,200
So now all you have to do is just start buying some better foods

552
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
And then we'll maybe lower the rate again

553
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,200
I guarantee you we're going to see that in our lifetime

554
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
My friends you heard it here first

555
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Just like I predicted 100 dollar barrel oil

556
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,200
This is going to happen in our lifetimes

557
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Bob is stepping up

558
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Bob was really the guy who got everything going

559
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,200
What a round episode seven twenty seven twenty one

560
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
I think so a couple weeks ago he's back

561
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,200
And he's got some manners mind

562
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,200
He was also by the way responsible for the opening of today's chart

563
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Hey Adam further to our recent conversation

564
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,200
And also the correspondence you've had in from other listeners

565
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
You're quite right or they're quite right

566
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,200
It is in fact illegal to protest in this country

567
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,200
So what I suggest we do is we have a fashion awareness campaign

568
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Yes

569
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
I think we should have t-shirts

570
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,200
It's really available for people to download and print

571
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,200
In any format they should see fit

572
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,200
And make a contribution to amnesty international

573
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,200
I'm going to set a website up where people can access t-shirt designs

574
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Which our Frankie says you work for us

575
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
And I think they should download them

576
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
And get them printed as many times they like

577
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
And distribute them amongst their friends

578
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,200
For occasional gatherings at well-known places

579
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Such as behind celebrities

580
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Behind politicians during photo sessions

581
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,200
I'd like you to get the message across that way

582
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,200
But as I say only on condition that people make a contribution

583
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,200
To something like amnesty international at a time

584
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Hey hey Bob

585
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Can't we set up a store at like cafe press or something

586
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,200
And then because I saw the designs he made they're really good looking

587
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,200
And although Frankie says it's kind of overplayed

588
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
It is a throwback to the 80s

589
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,200
We're all children of the 80s who are actually interested in this I believe

590
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
So I think it's appropriate

591
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
We could set it up that way

592
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
I think you can even set up how money is distributed

593
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
So have a look into that

594
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
I think it's a great idea

595
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
So we don't actually have to go through the hassle of finding a way to print them

596
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
But just have that printed on demand

597
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
I think cafe press does it

598
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,200
Let's check and see if we have a good supplier for that here in the UK

599
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
I think it's an awesome idea and I love your designs man

600
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
I'm the apprenticeship

601
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
I think that's only fair

602
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Of course they're standing up for our human rights

603
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Which I think is pretty well the only people who are these days

604
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Moving on to your other subject of your accountancy situation and tax

605
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:27,200
I'm unsure that you're aware of the new law that came in on the 17th of December of last year

606
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Yes, anybody in this country who's self-employed in whatever format

607
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Has to be audited once every three years by their accountant

608
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
Now what does that mean?

609
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,200
In real terms the accountant is doing the England revenues job

610
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,200
And they are seeing if you can afford your lifestyle

611
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
So wait a minute

612
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
That's a hidden tax right there

613
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
A hidden tax

614
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Thank you for pointing that out Bob

615
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Yes ladies and gentlemen, all self-employed people listening to this

616
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Once every three years your friend little accountant has always been on your side

617
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Will be asking you to provide your personal statements

618
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Your personal bank balances your personal cards, your points cards

619
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,200
And they will work out whether you can afford to live in that house

620
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Whether you can afford to drive that car

621
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,200
And if you can't they are under law

622
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Required to let the inland revenue know and put you on the naughty list

623
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,200
They course of course can't let you know that you're on the naughty list

624
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,200
But you will be not only that

625
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,200
And this is their good part

626
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,200
They reckon they're going to charge you at the 750 pounds for the privilege

627
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Yes indeed we are going to be paying an additional 750 pounds on top of our normal accounting bill

628
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,200
So that the accountant can look at us in greater detail

629
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,200
And apparently the chartered Institute of Accountants

630
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Recon that the accountancy will make more money out of that charge

631
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Then they will out of the average self-employed or business persons

632
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Accountancy bill

633
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
So I'll leave you with that happy thought

634
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,200
And remember Frank he says you work for us

635
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Hell yeah

636
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Hell yeah

637
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Get us that up dude

638
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Let me know where we can

639
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Where we can find

640
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Either the downloadable art

641
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Or let's see if we can get a whole t-shirt front to back process going

642
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
I'll promote the hell out of it

643
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
I promise you

644
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,200
And then of course you need to find a great domain name for that

645
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
And I suggest you use my code

646
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
DSC3

647
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,200
It'll buy us a year's worth of that domain name

648
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
At godaddy.com

649
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,200
You can find the links for that in the show notes at daily source code

650
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Of course

651
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Oh man Bob fantastic

652
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Yes you work for us indeed

653
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,200
I think we need a little breather here from this topic

654
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
I got another really good one coming up

655
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
And actually I have a real nice gem for you

656
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Once in a while you'll stumble across an old photo album

657
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,200
I mean like really old not like five years old

658
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
But really really old

659
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,200
And what I have for you now I think

660
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Is about 30 years old

661
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,200
I don't know the exact release date

662
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
But I do remember that

663
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,200
I do remember that

664
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
When this song

665
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Not when it was written but when it was recorded

666
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
I don't

667
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,200
No, in fact I'm quite sure I was under the age of 16

668
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Now I come from an interesting family

669
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,200
And my two sisters I'm sure they're listening to this now

670
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
They'll be laughing when I say that

671
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,200
The musical influences in the early days in the curry household

672
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
We're pretty much determined by

673
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Well I've talked to you about the real-to-real tape recorder that we used to have

674
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
And what was on that

675
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,200
But my father also played guitar

676
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Six ring guitar, 12 string guitar and mandolin

677
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Not extremely well I'd have to say

678
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,200
And the songs were all kind of like really throwback hippies, tunes

679
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
But he wrote this one song

680
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Which he would play over and over and over again

681
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
And even when we had friends over to the house

682
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,200
He picked up the guitar and he played the song

683
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Which he wrote himself

684
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
And we'd always laugh about it

685
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
You know it's

686
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,200
And I think recently it Christmas

687
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
We probably even laughed about the song

688
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
We all know it front to back

689
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Completely by heart

690
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,200
So this is as I said it's 30 years old

691
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,200
This song I can't remember exactly how it came to pass

692
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
But the song that my dad wrote

693
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Did get recorded

694
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
And I remember quite distinctly driving

695
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
We were on our way back from somewhere

696
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Like maybe a Sunday and there was a program

697
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,200
I think it was either a jazz or a country in western

698
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Kind of like a hybrid radio program

699
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
When the Netherlands really only had a couple

700
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Public broadcast stations

701
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
And the band performed this live

702
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
On one of these shows

703
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,200
And I remember we were in the car on our way back from somewhere

704
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,200
And my dad had timed it out and he turned on the radio

705
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
And I think that even mentioned that it was written by him

706
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Quite recall but I remember there was like

707
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Wow man they're playing a fracking song on the radio

708
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,200
And it actually sounds pretty good now that you're not seeing it

709
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,200
So Bob is my mom's second husband

710
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,200
He's at my mom passed away year and a half ago

711
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Yeah, how long ago has it been?

712
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Seems like just recent yet ages ago

713
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
That's kind of weird anyway

714
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
He was cleaning out some stuff in the house

715
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,200
And he came across the vinyl album

716
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
That contains this song

717
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,200
And so he and Bob's got some skills man

718
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
He got it

719
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
I think he digitized it

720
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
I don't know if he did or if Willow did my sister

721
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Anyway, we saw Willow sent it out yesterday

722
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
To a family email

723
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
And it just cracked me up

724
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
And even Patricia you know I was playing it upstairs

725
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
And she'd never heard the song

726
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Of course she's heard me referencing or seeing a couple of bars

727
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
And she went oh my god

728
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
That's the song

729
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
So this is a true

730
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,200
A true entry to the soundtrack to my life

731
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
And I'll tell you this about the song

732
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
It was the first

733
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Although it's real a shit kicker music

734
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
The lyrics to this song

735
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
It was the first song that made me realize

736
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,200
That a song could also really have an important message

737
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,200
And this one has a great message

738
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,200
Even today when you if you

739
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Listen to Obama speech the other day

740
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
This message will hit home for you

741
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
It's it's true Americana

742
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
It's true shit kicker music

743
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,200
It's titled Blood Brother written by Jay Curry

744
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Performed by Luke warm water

745
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Check it out y'all

746
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
Nice transfer

747
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Here we go

748
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,200
We're gonna go

749
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
We're gonna go just to Georgia

750
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
But daddy hit him on

751
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
He had to work for you hard all day

752
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
But I never done a song

753
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Like every other country

754
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
And it goes every trace

755
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Made them through the word and even the other piece

756
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
They're placed

757
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Blood Brother

758
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Blood Brother

759
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Now they'll need it some memories

760
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Blood Brother

761
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,200
Blood Brother

762
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
My name is now a part of me

763
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
When my family always went to war

764
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
When it went to David Cole

765
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Found a 70 and a half years ago last fall

766
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
I didn't mind apartheid

767
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
And it carried it in the past

768
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
But it never could be these tears

769
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
So I didn't do this black

770
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Blood Brother

771
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Blood Brother

772
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,200
Now they'll need some memories

773
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Blood Brother

774
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
Blood Brother

775
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
A morning is not part of me

776
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Blood Brother

777
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,200
A morning is not part of me

778
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
Blood Brother

779
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
A morning is not part of me

780
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Blood Brother

781
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
A morning is not part of me

782
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Blood Brother

783
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Blood Brother

784
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
A morning is not part of me

785
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Blood Brother

786
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Blood Brother

787
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
Blood Brother

788
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Blood Brother

789
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,200
Blood Brother

790
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,200
A night is not part of me

791
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Hanging behind

792
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Listen, watch me

793
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,200
A day is not part of me

794
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Bulman is no man

795
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Blood Brother

796
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
A day is not part of me

797
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
Blood Brother

798
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,720
Fальных

799
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
I'll give up carrot

800
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Blood Brother

801
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Another day is not part of me

802
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Blood Brother

803
00:27:36,200 --> 00:28:06,160
Now I'm back here in Georgia and she starts to be here.

804
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:11,040
But I'm so glad I came tonight to save these words to you.

805
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,320
You can't tell by a skin color if a man is better good.

806
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:22,080
So everybody get together now and live in Brotherhood.

807
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,240
The world is the most beautiful world.

808
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,120
The world is the most beautiful world.

809
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,360
The world is the most beautiful world.

810
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,880
The war water, blood brother and how man.

811
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,920
Isn't that awesome?

812
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,720
It's not wonderful that unlike a photo album we can actually share that.

813
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,640
And of course what you're hearing here is a clear example of the values that were instilled

814
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:59,240
me as a young child. And for all of all the things we dislike about our parents, I have to

815
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:06,040
say this one is high on the list of awesome things. Probably unknowingly, honestly my dad was

816
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:11,720
probably going for a blockbuster smash in a country music award. But I think what it really

817
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:22,520
did that are all these years has influenced and absolutely influenced and motivated myself and my

818
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:29,640
sisters in a certain direction in life and a certain look on life. And I think it's a really

819
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,480
beautiful thing and I'm really happy I was able to play that for you. Now let's talk about some

820
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,240
shit, Charlie. Let me say I get a little bit of music here because it's a rather long comment,

821
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:46,520
but it'll be worth it. This is, um, hold on. Remember I got an email from, uh, I told you about this,

822
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:54,920
an email from Libby. I'm just looking for it here in the, uh, in my system working well. Okay, here it is.

823
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:03,160
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I can't seem to find it. That's kind of weird. Anyway, um,

824
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:11,000
hold on. This is bumming me out. I'm sorry to be able to find this. Okay, I can't. Anyway,

825
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,040
this was about alcohol and Britain and Libby responded and she is uh,

826
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:23,560
she's a consultant and she's actually working for the government on coming up with strategies on what we

827
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:28,280
can do about teenage binge drinking and of course I say it goes all the way back to the core.

828
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,080
We have to find out why people are so incredibly unhappy in doing this and that she sent me

829
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:40,520
response as requested. So, uh, let me just, uh, let me just set it up here. I did something incredibly

830
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:48,440
stupid. Well, uh, it will turn that one down a bit. And let's listen to, uh, Libby, hold on. Here's

831
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,080
you come. Hello, Adam. This is Libby Renzetta, calling in to follow up the email that you mentioned,

832
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:59,400
um, on DSC 724, where I wanted to talk about alcohol and, uh, sorry, it's taking me so long to,

833
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,200
to call in, but I can't keep up with all the shows you're doing this week. Um, yes, I wanted to pick

834
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,080
up on some of the things you've been saying about alcohol recently, but also to ask a favor for me.

835
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,280
So, you've been saying that, um, you don't agree that putting the price up of alcohol is,

836
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:19,160
it's the way to tackle some of our problems in this country and that we should tackle the root causes.

837
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,560
Uh, and of course, um, that's right, you know, everyone would agree with that, but I think it's,

838
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:29,080
it's quite difficult to do it because we do have, um, a culture drinking to get drunk in this country.

839
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,000
And we have done for a long time. I think it's not just the UK that I think it's, um,

840
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,240
in common with some of the northern European countries, which is why some funds gets blamed on

841
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,840
the climate. Um, but there's no doubt that we do have particular problems at the moment. Uh, you know,

842
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:49,160
we've seen death by a liver cirrhosis double in the last 10 years, and, um, the mainstream media

843
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:54,520
is, is talking every day. It seems about, um, problems with young people drinking and getting into

844
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,440
trouble. Actually, I think young people get, um, I'm fairly picked on and demonised if you like,

845
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:06,440
because, um, adults are just as bad and I'm sure the young people are taking their cue from the rest of us.

846
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,560
You know, the statistics are just that, um, 30% of adults are drinking more than they should,

847
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,800
and that one in 20 of us is actually dependent on alcohol. So these are huge numbers,

848
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:21,000
and we're not setting a very good example for young people. But in terms of what we should do about it,

849
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,440
to tackle the root causes, if you like, I think, um, you might not like your price prices,

850
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,320
a factor. Um, but for me, the big factor that's missing at the moment is some kind of credible

851
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,440
health message about alcohol, and what we do to ourselves when we do drink too much, because the

852
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:42,600
the recommended sense will limit for adults and drinking. It actually quite low, and I think

853
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,240
a lot of people just don't feel incredible. So, um, I don't know if you're familiar with the

854
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,120
concept of units of alcohol, but, um, but the recommended, uh, limits of women are two to three

855
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,160
a day and for men three to four. You know, so if you take, um, a bottle of wine these days,

856
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,480
we've got nine or ten units in it. If a, if a blox is going to drink half a bottle of wine,

857
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,800
he's already exceeded his daily recommended limits. And I think it's a lot of people that just

858
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:11,480
doesn't seem credible. You know, we need really decent messages about drinking more than

859
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,800
doing to us physically. Um, I'm sure plenty of people out there won't be strangers to

860
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,040
drinking a whole bottle of wine in one go. Uh, we just don't know what damage that does. That's

861
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:28,200
our other than a mild headache the next day. So this brings me on to the favor I want to ask, Adam,

862
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,440
there's so much going on in alcohol policy at the moment. The government have finally tweaked

863
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,280
that there are probably some votes in trying to do something about alcohol. So I think it's where

864
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,960
we've seen the, the price rise. Uh, the chances to put up the duty on on alcohol, having frozen

865
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,840
the duty on spirits for the last 10 years of this labor government. It seems to be a completely

866
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,640
opportunistic way to, to raise some money rather than a genuine attempt to tackle drinking. But

867
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,480
anyway, that's another matter. The government are doing lots of things, good and bad. And there's

868
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,320
also lots of things happening in the field that are, that are very interesting. And I think what we

869
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:05,960
could really do with is a good podcast to bring the field together and inform and energise

870
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,280
an exciting people. And if I had to go it doing this, but I realised that I really need a good

871
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,200
producer to help me. And so I wondered if that's something you could help me with, help me find a

872
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,640
producer to do this show. And if anyone out there's interested, I can be contacted on my blog,

873
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:25,880
WWW, so I'll call policy.net, and it'd be really fantastic to hear from someone. Okay, so that's

874
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,240
it. Adam, thanks very much. Love you, hope you're in, et cetera. Cheers.

875
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,760
Libby, thank you so much. And I did find her email just to complete that. She runs England's

876
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:40,280
leading consultancy organization advising local government on alcohol harm reduction. She goes on to

877
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,360
say, business is booming, but it isn't bringing about the changes I want to see fast enough. So here's

878
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,920
someone who actually cares and wants to make something happen. And apparently it's making a living

879
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,800
at it as well. So it just goes to show. There is a role for high quality podcasts to update the

880
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,280
field about what's happening, what works and to bring new people on board. I could not agree more.

881
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,560
So there you go, Libby. I hope it works out. Please keep me informed us to, uh,

882
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:09,000
that's the progress and we'll keep tabs on that as time goes on. He listened to daily source code

883
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,960
episode number 736. I got to stay in kind of the shit kicker mode. This time for the pod save music

884
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,920
network. I really love the lyrics. Billy Burman is the wine of her lips.

885
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:39,000
She wants to see me one more time. I didn't want her, but I guess I'd have a good life. I

886
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:48,120
did to do the wine of her lips. Wine of her lips. She's got lips, tastes like wine. She's beautiful.

887
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:55,880
It'll survive. I want her to be a husband with wine of her lips. The wine of her lips come on.

888
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,440
What is this over? What the hell? I guess it's all just as well.

889
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:18,600
The members of the major, the force you've had in the wine of her lips. The wine of her lips.

890
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,960
All the violin received again. I wonder what she meant, but there was still a great dance.

891
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:31,800
Maybe some time before the end, I'll taste the wine of her lips. The wine of her lips. She's got lips,

892
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:39,480
tastes like wine. She's beautiful. It'll survive. I want her to be a husband with wine of her lips.

893
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,240
The wine of her lips come on.

894
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,720
Whether there is intent or what I do tommorow that doesn't lie.

895
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,880
Maybe some time before the end, but one more time before the end.

896
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,240
That's all has happened, it'll survive. I've got her to be a husband of her lips.

897
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:01,240
I want her to be a husband with wine of her lips. The shinning is the야 of her lips.

898
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,000
Just before sheUNFLU, it'll be a pain of her lips of sheUNFLU.

899
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,440
Well, this document is still Toto Mahneve's case, I said I'll be free from roots

900
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,880
and because I have no idea who the person was before the end, it'll be okay for a moment.

901
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,880
Why the lips?

902
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,020
The wine of this

903
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,420
Why the lips

904
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,420
Why never

905
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,700
Feeling burdened for the outside music network you'll find a link to

906
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,720
His music in the show notes a DailySource code calm the wine of her lips

907
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,720
Hey, you know, I want to thank everybody for participating and contributing to the show

908
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,520
You have no idea how incredibly important it is every single morning when I'm doing a program, of course

909
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,520
Of course, when I'm doing the show prep, it's really what you guys send me.

910
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
You know, it's the song suggestions.

911
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,520
It's the artists who contribute their music to the positive music network.

912
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,520
It's the master's and the master's doing the mashups.

913
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,520
It's the voicemail comments.

914
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,520
It's the recorded bits.

915
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
It's all of that put together.

916
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,520
It's the emails that's everything.

917
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
So I really appreciate it.

918
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
I'm just driving.

919
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
All right.

920
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520
That's all I'm doing.

921
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,520
You guys are filling this puppy up with fuel, and it is highly appreciated.

922
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
So tomorrow, Fubar Friday, you know the drill.

923
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,520
You got to send me all of the tunes.

924
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,520
I really want to rock it out.

925
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
I'm going to be home all day.

926
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,520
So I think it's a good Friday tomorrow.

927
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,520
So let's make it a great Friday.

928
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:21,520
So of course, I would remind you that the most important thing you can do to be happy is to live your

929
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,520
life with passion.

930
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,520
And while it lasts, enjoy your freedom.

931
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
Another pod show podcast.

932
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
Stick it in your ear.

933
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,520
Thank you.
