1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Make a statement with Sony stereo ear buds, sleek metal housings that reduce vibration

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,280
delivering killer sound from a tiny package, by yours at Sony.com-slashheadphones, Sony

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:22,400
ear buds with style meets sound.

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,640
There's only two men in the world that could pull off the DSC 709, and ironically, both of

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,240
them are Adam Curry.

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,440
Confused, you won't be after the daily source code.

7
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:11,040
Keep it in hit, be out of nowhere, just when I thought I had everything, didn't recognize

8
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:20,240
a feeling, feel like a rush coming to me, yeah you were shining like a diamond, just like a

9
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:30,840
girl from a baby, your mystery is getting to me but so fast, and not a day go by, you'll

10
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:39,640
know my body, I'll take my time, I think you'll find it, not a day go by, I don't know why,

11
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:48,920
I'm gonna be out of love, I'm thinking of how to save it, I'm afraid that the gentleman

12
00:01:48,920 --> 00:02:01,000
took me to me, could've stopped myself shaking, I knew I'd just spent my destiny, yeah

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,240
you were just like a angel, you were just a friend that you loved at me, you're the world

14
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:17,440
girl in a million, I never believed, I would never see, tell you not to be, and that wasn't

15
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:26,840
changed my life, and now the day goes by, no matter what I'm about, I'll take my time, I'll make you

16
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:35,080
find it, not a day go by, I don't know why, I'm gonna be out of love, I'm thinking of love, I'm thinking

17
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:57,560
of love, I'm just a friend, I'll have you find it, you were just like a angel, you

18
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,560
You gotta take your back

19
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,560
You gotta take your back

20
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,560
You gotta take my back

21
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,560
You gotta take your back

22
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,560
You gotta take your back

23
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,560
You gotta take your back

24
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,560
You gotta take your back

25
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,560
You gotta take your back

26
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Man, I'm such a sucker for a hooky pop song

27
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Love it

28
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Cherry's swayed from the pop song music network

29
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
Not a day goes by

30
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Just part of the soundtrack to our lives here

31
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,560
For those of you who've been listening to Charlie for...

32
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,560
Excuse me

33
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
More than a year or so

34
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
I love it

35
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,560
It's particularly that 80 sound, man

36
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
It's been filled right at home

37
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
Yep

38
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
That's...

39
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Cousin mold

40
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Welcome to Daily Source Code episode

41
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Number 709 coming to you for the curry manner

42
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
And west side of G-town

43
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
That affluent suburb of Surrey

44
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Known as Gilford

45
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,560
It's actually Tuesday evening

46
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,560
It's about 915-920

47
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,560
And I had to get a show out today

48
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,560
First of all, because I promised it's second of all

49
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,560
Because I really wanted to respond to this Chris Moils thing

50
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,560
If you've been following the weblog at curry.com

51
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,560
You probably saw a posting about it this morning

52
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,560
That Chris Moils, who's a very famous morning radio guy

53
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Here in the UK on radio one

54
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,560
He was talking about me

55
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Apparently talking shit

56
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
So we'll get to that in a minute

57
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,560
So it's kind of been a long day

58
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Because I did have to go into the city

59
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,560
I didn't have time to do the show at the regular time

60
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
In the morning

61
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,560
I had to go to my new

62
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,560
My new tax advisors at Pricewaterhouse Cooper's

63
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
It's pretty funny

64
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,560
They actually have a brochure

65
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,560
That it's kind of like a really expensive glossy

66
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,560
One flip open inside type brochure

67
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,560
One page

68
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
International entrepreneurs

69
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
When your personal business interest cross borders

70
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
So does our tax advice

71
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
And it's really true

72
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
I've committed to my wife

73
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
And to our banker, charity

74
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,560
The beautiful blonde in the Netherlands

75
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,560
My backup wife

76
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,560
That I would really get PWC involved

77
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Because what happens with the guy like me is

78
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
I'm working here, I'm working in the states

79
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Sometimes I do something in the Netherlands

80
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
As all kinds of

81
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Well basically everyone winds up wanting a piece of my money

82
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,560
And the worst, you know, because you can get credits

83
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,560
If you pay tax in one country, you don't have to pay in another

84
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
But if you don't set it up right

85
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Then eventually they all come at you

86
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
And they all want the money

87
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
And I'm kind of tired to plan the games

88
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,560
So I committed I would get all that shit set up right

89
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
And low and behold

90
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Recommended by the beautiful banks

91
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
In Holland

92
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,560
Another great looking woman

93
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Who would be my advisor here

94
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,560
South African

95
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,560
God, I'm lucky

96
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,560
All right, so here's what happened this morning

97
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,560
I got up real early by the way

98
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Like 630, because you know

99
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,560
There's this thing with the trash over here, man

100
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,560
First of all, we can't really leave anything out

101
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,560
The night before because, you know, where we live

102
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,560
West side, remember

103
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,560
The end, the foxes get into it

104
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
And so it gets thrown all across the road

105
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,560
So we really have to have to put the bins out in the morning

106
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,560
And they show up really unpredictable times

107
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,560
So you have to pretty much, you know, have everything out

108
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,560
Between 7 and 730, because if you miss them then

109
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
You know, it's a whole another week

110
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,560
And actually want to extend that to 14 days now

111
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,560
I mean, that's not going to be a trash problem here

112
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,560
There already is a trash problem actually

113
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
So anyway, so

114
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,560
I'm up and about around, you know, 730, whatever

115
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Upstairs, looking at email, drinking a cup of tea

116
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
And I start getting emails from people saying

117
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
A Christmas just talked about you about 715

118
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
And, you know, and so I blogged about it

119
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,560
And wanted to know if anyone had, you know, had found

120
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Obviously, I didn't expect them to have a

121
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
And, you know, the podcast version up

122
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
But I was wondering if anyone had heard it

123
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
And so people started me links

124
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
And then, of course, the official

125
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,560
A historian of the daily source code, Tom Schuiting

126
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Clawgwag from Down Under

127
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
He of course found it

128
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Spotted off on to MP3 format

129
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
And sent me a link

130
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,560
You know, within like maybe 45 minutes of the first email I got

131
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,560
And he's in Australia, so I think he had to go to bed

132
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
Anyway, so

133
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,560
I'm really quite bummed about this situation

134
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
And this actually does prove a point

135
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
The John Devore, I can I were talking about

136
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
I know a gender recently

137
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Where John said that he felt that

138
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,560
The way the internet is culturally growing

139
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
And shaping itself, they would actually

140
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
Really hurt news

141
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
And the truth and good reporting

142
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
And facts

143
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,560
And I've always kind of been a believer

144
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
That, you know, the truth eventually

145
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Bubbles to the top even though I have several personal examples

146
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Where that didn't happen

147
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,560
In fact, what I see more and more

148
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Is, you know, these

149
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,560
This kind of spectacle of the society

150
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Thing where we latch on to a certain mean

151
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,560
Build the story

152
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Blog about it, blog about it, blog about it

153
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Aggregate it, blog about it

154
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,560
And before you know it, there's pretty much

155
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
An untruth or

156
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,560
Certainly something taken out of context

157
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,560
That is grown beyond proportion of what it was to begin with

158
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
And that's actually how all of this started

159
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
When I think about

160
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Was it maybe three quarters of a year ago or so

161
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Maybe even longer

162
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,560
I think it was like Chris Moiles

163
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
I did go back to the episodes

164
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,560
I don't want to play that original episode

165
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Because there are a couple of bits and bytes I want you to hear

166
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
And particularly with Chris Moiles said about me this morning

167
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,560
He's been to good amount of time talking about me

168
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Which in a way, of course, is quite flattering

169
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,560
Anyway

170
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,560
There was something that he had said about podcasting

171
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,560
And then, you know, I went through that

172
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
All day and there were a couple comments and people said

173
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Some people said he was a wanker

174
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
And, you know, there was all these different opinions

175
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Which pretty much were based on

176
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
Memology, if you will

177
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Or just stuff that's out there

178
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,560
And, well, I'll let Chris Moiles explain it the way he explained it this morning

179
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,560
It's kind of weird because this happened so long ago

180
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
I've forgotten the entire incident

181
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,560
And this is now just only now bubbling to the top

182
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,560
Of course, because someone stumbled across this

183
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
That knows Chris Moile

184
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
Or email the two of them or whatever and said

185
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Dude, you got to listen to this guy

186
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
And, you know, so he did some research

187
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,560
But not enough and

188
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Well, you'll, I'm bummed about it

189
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
You'll find out why after, after we listen to this bit

190
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,560
Erred this morning

191
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,560
I'm BBC radio one

192
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
So, let me just get something I'm going to put in

193
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
I'm going to name

194
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Oh, I just great thing yesterday

195
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
I've been getting a slagging on some podcast

196
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
But, like, from ages and ages ago

197
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,560
From, like, over year ago

198
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,560
And it's podcast

199
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Oh, I don't know

200
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,560
I want you to want to talk about it

201
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,560
Just because it was a very odd thing

202
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,560
I stumbled across

203
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,560
This Adam Curry podcast yesterday

204
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,560
Adam Curry is the guy who's

205
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,560
He's often credited as a man who invented podcasts

206
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,560
So I came up with a podcast right

207
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,560
Anyway, so don't ask me how I end up in a

208
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Because I genuinely actually can't remember

209
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,560
But I'm, I'm on the net and I'm kind of jumping

210
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,560
From thing to thing

211
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,560
You know, like you do

212
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,560
And then I end up on the net

213
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,560
He was, he goes surfing is what he was doing

214
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
Obviously he's putting his name into Google

215
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
And into Google blog search

216
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,560
And, oh, wait a minute

217
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,560
There's a podcast where I mentioned

218
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
Let me listen to it

219
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,560
This Adam Curry guy

220
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,560
He gave me off on one of his podcasts

221
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
Right?

222
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,560
And so he has all these people

223
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Find out, go, oh, Chris Moe's an idiot

224
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
Blow, he's an American guy

225
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
That's exactly what I said

226
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Is that there were people

227
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Yeah, that's what people called in with

228
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,560
You make it sound like I'm telling people to call in and say that

229
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Obviously, I wasn't

230
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,560
So that's these people

231
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,560
So I'm listening to this guy this

232
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
It's quite funny

233
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,560
He's an absolute tool

234
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,560
He boils my attack

235
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
Man, he flows my attack

236
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
He's an absolute

237
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,560
B-B-B-B-B-B-B

238
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,560
And what you said about him

239
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
The other day, that's just, you know, sure

240
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,560
And I'm like, what's going on?

241
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,560
I've got to say, go, that seems to be like a strand

242
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
So then I, I did it

243
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,560
I've been very cool

244
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
The Chris Moe, he must've spent a lot of time

245
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Going through all that stuff

246
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,560
And what he calls a strand

247
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,560
Yes, what we call a thread, you know, this is what people do

248
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,560
Catch up on the show

249
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
So they can figure out where the hell this came from

250
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
Interesting, even Chris Moeils is doing it

251
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
That's some good data there

252
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
Guys, I find the podcastman

253
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
I've originally talked about it

254
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
And it's the weirdest thing because

255
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
I kind of don't really get the point

256
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
Of why he slags me off

257
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
But he's calling me a banker

258
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
No, no, no, no, no, no way

259
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
This is what people who were calling in

260
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
We're calling you

261
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,560
Right?

262
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
And these were all based upon, you know, people's opinions

263
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,560
And I think just a lot of stuff that's out there on the net

264
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
Just like you're, what's on your Wikipedia page

265
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,560
You know what I'm talking about

266
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
There's some, and I'm like, what?

267
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
And they play a clip from our show

268
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
On that podcast, which part of why he did that permission for?

269
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
Yeah, okay, okay, please, Chris, please

270
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,560
You know, this, that's very used dude

271
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
You know, they even have that in the UK

272
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
So, what are you worried about?

273
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
What are you worried about?

274
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
We're going to get the fucking BBC, you make a billion

275
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,560
Dollarsy, a million pounds

276
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
At least, you're doing fine and worried about that

277
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
Let's just have some fun

278
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Yes, yeah, sure, sure, sure

279
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
But, you know, whatever

280
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
And it's from our show

281
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
From about

282
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,560
November, 2006 or something

283
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
Where Michelle the cleaner gets the reference

284
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
Right?

285
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
And he goes, he keeps pulling

286
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Like the show

287
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
And yeah, like this, right?

288
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
Yeah, he's net irritating

289
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
And coming in and talking over it

290
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,560
And he goes, by the way, that's not cool

291
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
It's taking me out of someone's voice

292
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,560
Because they're from somewhere else

293
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Because you know, Michelle the cleaner

294
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
It's not cool man

295
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
That's not cool man, it's taking me out

296
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
That's how he's saying

297
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
It's the weirdest thing

298
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
You know, here's the guy who's cleaning up your stuff

299
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
You know, I'm getting you tea, and the guy has no idea what he's talking about

300
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
You know, we've all done it

301
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,560
You know, when you walk into see

302
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
You might in the pub by the office

303
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
And you walk in on a conversation

304
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,560
And you try and join in

305
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,560
You can completely get the wrong idea

306
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,560
And that's exactly the point Chris

307
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
That's exactly what you did

308
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
You walked in on our conversation

309
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Or strand, as we say

310
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
And you completely missed the point of it

311
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,560
And unfortunately, you didn't really follow the entire thread

312
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
You probably would have been quite surprised

313
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
Will you will be?

314
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
And you start plowing through and they'll go and they know what he's talking about

315
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
But it's podcast

316
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
And it's like American slugging you off as well

317
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
No, no, just praise my words

318
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Just Brit, exactly, not me, the Brit

319
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
And at the whole point of it is

320
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
Is the fact that I've heard something to do with

321
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
I mentioned podcasts

322
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
And I mentioned this Adam Curry guy

323
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
And he just is

324
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
I think he just too podcast, which is what I've watched out now

325
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
He's got one where he just rambles on about

326
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,560
He's got one which is like best bits of podcasts

327
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
From around the world

328
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
He's talking about pod finder

329
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
And I'm talking about this one

330
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
And you're saying about how

331
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
I don't really understand

332
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
I've never really downloaded anything in the blah blah blah blah

333
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
Got those days when I didn't really understand

334
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
I'm because of that

335
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Then he starts having to go up

336
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
He didn't understand it, that's exactly right

337
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
But I wasn't having to go out here

338
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
I wasn't having to laugh

339
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
I don't understand podcasts, and I'm a banker

340
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
And all this

341
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
And it's the weirdest thing

342
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
I'm banker

343
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
And do you go?

344
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
I'm sure I did not call you a banker

345
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Yeah, I understand how it works

346
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
You know, I listen to it on my computer

347
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
Through the speakers and he goes

348
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
This guy obviously knows what he's talking

349
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Yeah, I'm not talking about it

350
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
I'm not talking about it

351
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
As being the man who invented podcasts

352
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,560
The rumor is about this guy

353
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
There wasn't a rumor

354
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
I don't know how true this is

355
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
Here we go, Chris

356
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
The rumor

357
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,560
Okay, it is

358
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
That he

359
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
He went on Wikipedia

360
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
And edited it

361
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
So that everyone else who got credited with invented podcasts

362
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
He removed that

363
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,560
He was the only one left

364
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
It's crazy

365
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
So which kind of

366
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,560
You know

367
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
I just like that

368
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
Oh my god

369
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
Alex on the grain belt

370
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
No

371
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
They didn't

372
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,560
I

373
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
That's brilliant

374
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
That's how rewriting

375
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,560
History

376
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,560
Yeah

377
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
It's super exact

378
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
I invented

379
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Correctional food

380
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
The car

381
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Yes, that was me

382
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
And I

383
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Anyway, so they continue slagging me off

384
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
A little bit there

385
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,560
And that's exactly my point

386
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
The point is

387
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
Chris, I actually like you

388
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,560
You know, I see on all kinds of stuff here

389
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
And you're not a bad singer either

390
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
And you seem like a pretty nice guy

391
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
And what's happened here

392
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Is my audience

393
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
You know, picked up on a whole bunch of memes

394
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,560
And you know, I could play this other bit of

395
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
Of the daily source code

396
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,560
Why I was corrected and where I actually

397
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,560
Apologize

398
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
You didn't hear that part

399
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
And I said the same thing

400
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
I don't know you

401
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
But you seem like a nice guy

402
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
You know, when I've listened to your show

403
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,560
It's cool

404
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,560
It's cool

405
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
You know, it's all right

406
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
And I'm a little bum

407
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,560
That the

408
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
You're propagating even

409
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,560
Stupid or shit about me

410
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,560
And I just want to get along

411
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,560
Here, let me

412
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,560
Talk about the episode 505

413
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
200 episodes ago

414
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
David Graham, we sent in that

415
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Six minute long comment

416
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Yesterday about Chris Moiles, the BBC

417
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
What they can and can't do with podcasts

418
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,560
He heard the call

419
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
He edited it down

420
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,560
To three minutes

421
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Okay

422
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
I'm not going to play the whole thing

423
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,560
But listen to a little bit

424
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
You'll get the idea

425
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Listen to the feedback you received

426
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
From your listeners about

427
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,560
The mention you got from Radio 1 DJ

428
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
Chris Moiles

429
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,560
I have to reply and make some corrections

430
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Our response from one of your listeners

431
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,560
Called James made out

432
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,560
The Chris Moiles was against podcasting

433
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,560
And so no future in it

434
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,560
This is incorrect

435
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,560
Chris actively promotes his podcast

436
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,560
Which in turn educates the public

437
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
About podcasting

438
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,560
This is pretty cool that I have this archive

439
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
And then you, of course, David emailed

440
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
To me and said, please remind everyone

441
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,560
That we already went through this

442
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,560
And we went, so these are all the things

443
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,560
That the British caller said

444
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,560
About Chris Moiles

445
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,560
And now here's this guy correcting it

446
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
Which is the way it should be

447
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
It's part of the strand, my boy

448
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,560
First we'd love to do a original content

449
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,560
For his podcast

450
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,560
But BBC rules restrict him from doing so

451
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,560
And the following explains this

452
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
It's the new and improved podcast this week

453
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
And I'll tell you what how this works

454
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
And I don't explain to you exactly the truth

455
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560
Who dug his currently loading it onto

456
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Anyway, let me just play the bit where I punch

457
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
Do you want to bother me in the slightest

458
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,560
I still find it

459
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
And believe I'm finding wasting time doing this

460
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
Fucking funny

461
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,560
He's really funny and he's endearing in

462
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
Wait

463
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
I hate, I hate all the games

464
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
But you are a bit mean to Ali

465
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,560
No, to be fair

466
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Let's just clear the sum

467
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
Yeah, there was something else

468
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,560
You guys called it and said that he was homophobic

469
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,560
So we pulled that apart as well

470
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Yeah, what's so to speak

471
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Anybody's sexual orientation is

472
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
I really care

473
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
How'd you know?

474
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,560
Hey talent though

475
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
But nothing to do with his gay

476
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
If he was bisexual, stray, acesial

477
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,560
Wouldn't bother me in the slightest

478
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
I'd still find him irritated with a G&G go

479
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Yeah

480
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,560
My follow questions

481
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
This statement, the Chris Swerzel

482
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
It's on there

483
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Again, which I think is untrue

484
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,560
The majority of time

485
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
It's Chris's guess who's swear

486
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,560
On there, not actually him

487
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,560
But again, the media headlines

488
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,560
It sounds like he was the one with the foul mouth

489
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Well, there you have it Adam

490
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
You can make your mind at what you really think Chris is like

491
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
I find it interesting that listeners

492
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Who obviously don't listen to Chris's show

493
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,560
Find it acceptable to comments on something

494
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
They don't listen to

495
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,560
I find that odd

496
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Anyway, this has been David Graham from Dorset

497
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
England

498
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,560
Who some of us say has been corrupted by Chris Mos

499
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Bruncha

500
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
Yeah, of course you're a scruncher

501
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Not you're absolutely right

502
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
I don't know Chris Moiles

503
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,560
I've not listened to his show enough

504
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,560
So you've certainly given me a different perspective

505
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
And I appreciate it

506
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,560
And I'm still watching

507
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,560
I'm a celebrity getting me out of here

508
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,560
Which I think is four more nights

509
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,560
Anyway, so there you go

510
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,560
So I was corrected

511
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,560
And hopefully now Chris is corrected

512
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,560
I'm sure whoever started this strand

513
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
I will finish it

514
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,560
And thanks for the mention, dude

515
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Traffic is up

516
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,560
And I welcome all of the Chris Moiles audience

517
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,560
It's really not that much difference between the two of us

518
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Except if I don't feel like doing a show

519
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
I don't do one

520
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,560
But I can do it whenever I feel like doing it

521
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,560
And Chris has a live program

522
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Which I have to say I'm pretty jealous of

523
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,560
I really like doing live radio

524
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,560
And you know that working on

525
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,560
Doing some experimenting and doing this live

526
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
Yeah, what within a couple of years may be five years

527
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
It'll be pretty normal

528
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,560
You'll just flip on whatever device you have

529
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,560
And it won't make any difference

530
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Whether it's streaming digital bits over the air

531
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,560
Through some kind of wireless provider

532
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,560
It's all going to be blank

533
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
It's just going to be all the same

534
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,560
It'll really come then it'll be an even playing field

535
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,560
When it comes to audience share

536
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,560
Yeah, I got time

537
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,560
All right

538
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,560
That's it

539
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
And of as we say here

540
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,560
Hey Adam, this is Michael Butler from the rock and roll geek show

541
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,560
Banging with Butler and several other train wrecks

542
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,560
I just came off the road

543
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,560
I was playing with this band Jetboy

544
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,560
And we were on tour with Steven Pearcey from Rat

545
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,560
And this other band the anti-division opened up the show

546
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,560
And I brought my little video camera

547
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
And I taped the entire thing

548
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,560
You can watch the entire thing

549
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,560
Only on the plus TV that plus

550
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,560
What is it that the plus TV dot com

551
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
Exclusively on the place

552
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
It's an exclusive

553
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,560
Off from January 11th through January 18th

554
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,560
You will see the opening band's drummer quit

555
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,560
Halfway through the tour you'll see Steven Pearcey's bass player quit

556
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,560
You'll see us driving through

557
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,560
Blizzards through rain through ice

558
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,560
You will see groupies

559
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
You'll see strippers

560
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,560
You'll see all the rock and roll decadent

561
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,560
It sounds like the high spot

562
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
It sounds like you're there

563
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,560
This thing should be nominated for like a

564
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,560
I don't know what is it like a Pulitzer Prize or a Sundance

565
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
It's really good

566
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
You will not

567
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,560
It's totally spinal to have

568
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
You just point to go to the plus TV dot com

569
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,560
From January 11th through the 18th

570
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,560
It's going to repeat every night

571
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,560
At 11 p.m. Pacific time

572
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Eastern time and whatever London time

573
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,560
That's what that Grinit's mean time

574
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,560
Plus TV dot com

575
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,560
It is called

576
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
I don't know what it's called

577
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
It's like behind the scenes of a rock and roll band

578
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
Or something like that

579
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,560
What a touring with Butler there you go

580
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
And stick around after that

581
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,560
You can see a new episode of Bangless Butler

582
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
Thanks a lot for promoting this

583
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
I really appreciate it

584
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Hey Mike, thanks man

585
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,560
Yeah

586
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,560
I can't wait

587
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
I gotta watch that

588
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,560
I presume that you'll have it in your feed later on

589
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Because I do want to keep stuff like that for prosperity

590
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,560
Because that's amazing

591
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
You know what?

592
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,560
It probably should be up for some kind of award

593
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,560
A betcha really rocks

594
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,560
Okay

595
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,560
A couple of comments

596
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,560
Come into the voice mail lines

597
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,560
Hi Adam, this is

598
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,560
Low from Merchyside

599
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,560
Again

600
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,560
You've probably been sent a link a million times

601
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,560
I'm just looking at a video on YouTube

602
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,560
By a guy called Scott Ritter

603
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
He's a UN

604
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,560
And he's completely

605
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
And utterly

606
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,560
This found in the series

607
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,560
That the run is a

608
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,560
Imminent nuclear threat

609
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,560
Excellent

610
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,560
To the American people and the country

611
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,560
If you just have searched on YouTube

612
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,560
For Scott Ritter on Iranian nuclear program

613
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,560
If it's a 10-minute video

614
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
I mean tell you why

615
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,560
They cannot

616
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,560
To be a threat

617
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,560
I mean in the first few minutes

618
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,560
One of the reasons it gives you is because of the centrifuges they have

619
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
Keep blowing up

620
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Whatever they've run them

621
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,560
Because the uranium is contaminated

622
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,560
With an album and coal, malignant

623
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
But anyway, it's really interesting

624
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
And just shows what a complaint

625
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,560
There's a bullshit, a bullshit

626
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
And the rest of these crony's out

627
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
Anyway

628
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Love you?

629
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
No homo

630
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Bye

631
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
He loved you no homo

632
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Yeah

633
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,560
I googled in my bookmarked it

634
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
That's got to be homework

635
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
I haven't had the time

636
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560
That's pretty cool

637
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
Yeah, there's a lot of talk about nuclear

638
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,560
In fact, I'm amazed that

639
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
Atomic Rod, one of our savants on duty

640
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,560
He hasn't called in yet

641
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
Because there's a lot of talk about

642
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Opening up nuclear plants

643
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
New nuclear plants in the UK

644
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,560
As a part of reducing carbon emissions

645
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,560
As well as just an alternative energy source

646
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,560
And so an old debate has been stirred up again

647
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,560
And it's pretty interesting to follow along

648
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,560
And by the way, it'll take until 2020

649
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
To bring new plants online

650
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,560
So yeah, it doesn't really surprise me

651
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,560
When I hear how long it takes just to build a couple new facilities

652
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,560
That Iran's centrifuge blades

653
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
Flappin' all of them blades

654
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Somehow it just doesn't surprise me

655
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Hey, man, this is John

656
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
Hey, John

657
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,560
Forlapodgeos.com

658
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,560
That's the real advice

659
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
But I was wondering

660
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Gillian lives show

661
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,560
Wouldn't it be extremely difficult to do it without a producer

662
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:12,560
I mean, would it be possible to do a quality of life show by yourself?

663
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
I was just wondering

664
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,560
All right, take care

665
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,560
I don't know what technology is or how he's doing

666
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,560
I know I wouldn't be able to do it

667
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
All right

668
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
He's up to good work

669
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,560
And let me talk to the next show

670
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
All right, talk to you

671
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
Bye

672
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,560
So this is for the live stuff that I want to do

673
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,560
And I think I am going to try it out with talk to you

674
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Because it seems like they have the interface that I need

675
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,560
Because yeah, obviously it would be nice to have a producer

676
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Or at least a producer

677
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,560
And it would be nice if a producer and a phone screener

678
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Someone who's basically taking calls

679
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
Listening to what the topic is

680
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
The person wants to discuss

681
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Then passes that on to the producer

682
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,560
The producer looks at the list of stuff

683
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
You know, makes choices

684
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,560
Make sure that people are still on the line

685
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
Talk soon does a little pre-chat

686
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,560
I mean, that's how a real professional get up would work

687
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,560
So I think that the way I want this to work

688
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,560
Is if we have a chat room

689
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
Right

690
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,560
And I have the ability to mute and unmute people

691
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,560
Which is I think is what the talk show interface has

692
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,560
You know, then people could be saying comments

693
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Or just writing a quick line about the topic they want to discuss

694
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,560
And whatever's going on

695
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
I could be following along with that

696
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,560
And I could probably multitask that much

697
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
Even though I'm a guy

698
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,560
And be able to pick the next topic

699
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,560
Or the next person that I would unmute

700
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,560
Or really bring the next caller in

701
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
So

702
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
And I really wanted to work without a producer

703
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
That's the whole point

704
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,560
And there's a lot of stuff

705
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
I can, you know, I'm used to doing a lot of stuff

706
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,560
While I'm talking

707
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
It does slow down the speech once in a while

708
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,560
Hey, this is Julio from New York

709
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
Julio

710
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Under the weather myself

711
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,560
I just can't hear it

712
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
Well, I actually started listening to DSC707

713
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,560
And I heard you're concerned about trying to do a live streaming show

714
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
With a live call and whatnot

715
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,560
And there's a podcast that already does this called

716
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
Keepnigirl.com

717
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,560
I know there's an animosity between you guys

718
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,560
At least I'm there indefinitely

719
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,560
But you might want to check out their website

720
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,560
Try to get some experts to probably do some reverse engineering

721
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,560
And figure out how podcasts can implement that same technology

722
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560
And get your live show going

723
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,560
Talk to you later

724
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Bye

725
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,560
Hi, man. Thanks Julio

726
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
Yeah

727
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,560
I think that, you know, there's a number of people on that show

728
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,560
So that does make it a little bit easier to do the

729
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
The whole thing, you know, like with the producer part

730
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,560
And screening the calls part

731
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
So

732
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
I got no item animosity towards them

733
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
Away

734
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
I kind of like it when they get all riled up

735
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,560
Anyway, I love the fact that your name is Julio

736
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,560
Because that reminded me that there's definitely another piece

737
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,560
That comprises the soundtrack of our lives

738
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Mys are all at some pole signing

739
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,560
When the papa found out he began to shout

740
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,560
The star of the investigation

741
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
It's against the law

742
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,560
It was against the law

743
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
I walked him out on his own

744
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,560
It was against the law

745
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Who didn't mind me looking down

746
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,560
And spit on the ground every time the name gets mentioned

747
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,560
The papa said, oh, if I get that boy

748
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,560
I'm gonna stick them in the house of the tension

749
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Well, I'm on the way

750
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
I don't know where I'm going

751
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,560
I'm on my way

752
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,560
I'm taking my time, but I don't know where

753
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
I'm about to roll

754
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Say, the queen of corona

755
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Say, me and Julio

756
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,560
Down by the school yard

757
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,560
I see me and Julio

758
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,560
Down by the school yard

759
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,560
I see me and Julio

760
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,560
Down by the school yard

761
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,560
I see me and Julio

762
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,560
Down by the school yard

763
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Down by the school yard

764
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,560
Down by the school yard

765
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,560
Down by the school yard

766
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560
Down by the school yard

767
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Down by the school yard

768
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Down by the school yard

769
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Down by the school yard

770
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Down by the school yard

771
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,560
Down by the school yard

772
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Down by the school yard

773
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,560
Down by the school yard

774
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,560
I don't know where I'm going

775
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,560
I'm on my way

776
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,560
I'm taking my time, but I don't know where

777
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
I'm about to roll

778
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Say, the queen of corona

779
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,560
Say, me and Julio

780
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,560
Down by the school yard

781
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560
I see me and Julio

782
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
Down by the school yard

783
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,560
Say, me and Julio

784
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Down by the school yard

785
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,560
I remember this the 45 actually

786
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,560
The vinyl single

787
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
I think it was on Holly Door

788
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Yeah, you can kind of remember the labels

789
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
From back in the day Paul Simon, me and Julio

790
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
Down by the school yard

791
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,560
And I would say we could start getting used to hearing

792
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,560
I would say we could start getting used to hearing

793
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,560
I would say we could start getting used to hearing

794
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,560
I would say we could start getting used to hearing

795
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,560
I would say we could start getting used to hearing

796
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,560
That type of music played legally

797
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,560
In independent productions

798
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,560
I can totally foresee this coming

799
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,560
If you've been following along with the EMI story man

800
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Those guys are in big trouble

801
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,560
It's front news here

802
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,560
The radio head, of course, left the label

803
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,560
I went on to arguably successfully sell

804
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,560
With the pay what you want model

805
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Robby Williams and said he's boycotting

806
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
Give his album

807
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,560
Sir Paul McCartney says that they're full of shit

808
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,560
You know and really what's happened here is the credit crunch is affected EMI

809
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,560
And they can't secure it ties the the back catalog

810
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Which was part of the how they were going to finance this whole deal

811
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,560
So it's really just a business problem

812
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,560
That's why they've cut 2,000 people

813
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
They need to save money

814
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
I can see what's going on there

815
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
That's really easy

816
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,560
Believe me, Greg Hans guy

817
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,560
He didn't you don't want to cut all the fruit and flowers budget

818
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,560
Which is a record-speak code for hookers and blow

819
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,560
You know, yeah it was 400,000 pounds worth of fat you cut right out

820
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,560
But he didn't want to really get rid of that

821
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,560
I had no way

822
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,560
I also think Robby Williams

823
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,560
How you get Robby Williams to hand over the goods

824
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,560
Yeah, it's a part of the system of their system at least

825
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Now I predict that's all falling apart

826
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
And I think that they're going to move into independent

827
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Promotion

828
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,560
You watch, it's going to happen

829
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,560
No doubt about it

830
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,560
And what promoters call on us and say hey man, we play my record

831
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,560
It's going to be interesting to see what happens

832
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,560
You watch, pay all will exist

833
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,560
And you know what, it'll be out in the open

834
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,560
And people will be cool with it

835
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
Because if they're not, they just won't listen to the shows

836
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,560
And it's all about the same integrity that we find on the internet

837
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,560
Which of course works in some ways doesn't work

838
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:33,560
Hi Adam, it's Matt from Gamesweasel

839
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
On this week's show we've got a review of Ratchet & Clank

840
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,560
Tools of Destruction for the PlayStation 3

841
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,560
Cypher & Filter Logan Shadow on the PSP

842
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,560
And I've got five copies of Ghost Squad for the Wii to give away

843
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,560
That's all at Gamesweasel.btpotshow.com

844
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,560
Alright, I'm going to wrap it up

845
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Got another song I want to play for you

846
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
With good reason

847
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,560
And I just want to say fuck you Steve Jobs

848
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,560
Man, you've taken money out of my wallet again

849
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Did you see the shit that they've got

850
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,560
Now, first of all, they upgrade the iPhone with all this groovy stuff

851
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:07,560
And they've got the SDK coming

852
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,560
Then this MacBook Air

853
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,560
Oh man, the thinnest notebook computer anywhere

854
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,560
And then the Apple TV, that looks positively awesome

855
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
Doesn't it?

856
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,560
Man, I can't wait to load up some video channels in that

857
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
That's going to be cool

858
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,560
That is really going to rock

859
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,560
So, anyway, piss me off

860
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,560
You know, it excites me, I just can't help myself

861
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,560
But I'm not going to buy a MacBook Air

862
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,560
I'm not going to, I'm going to wait

863
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
I just got the MacBook Pro

864
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,560
It's a plenty fast

865
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,560
I really like it, I've started to customize it the way I want it to be

866
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,560
And then around the time when it starts to fall apart

867
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,560
Then, of course, I'll do the easy Mac upgrade

868
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,560
And, you know, just plug one into the other

869
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,560
It'll transfer everything and it'll just work

870
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,560
If not, close it, shake it like an etchist catch

871
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
And open it and it'll work

872
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
That's a Mac

873
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,560
Hey, we out of Chris Copper here from Seattle

874
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,560
Washington Lone Time listener, call some time

875
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,560
And I wanted to tell you two things

876
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,560
The first one being that the song you played a couple of

877
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
So, let's go

878
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,560
I'm sure, which episode by Miss Michael thing

879
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Called the way I am

880
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
That's fun of getting played here on local radio

881
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,560
And Seattle ad nauseam

882
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,560
I got every 20 minutes on at least one of the local stations

883
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,560
So, pretty cool that it's up on public music network as well

884
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,560
Secondly, you would ask the comment about

885
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,560
How to do a live show

886
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,560
And that's going to stop just one of the way you know

887
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Talks to you

888
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,560
She used to be whatever you'd like to use this for live podcasting

889
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
Talks to you.com

890
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,560
Is where you can find it and

891
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,560
Every other show, listen to this, use it

892
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
Sounds great

893
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,560
So, I don't know if you're looking for more technical

894
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
This isn't that, but Talks to you.com

895
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
How's it going?

896
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,560
You good man?

897
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
That's a good work

898
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,560
Folder

899
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,560
Yep

900
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,560
Red pill

901
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,560
Yeah

902
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
Oh baby, no homo

903
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,560
All right, man, so the most important part of that message

904
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
Was of course that

905
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,560
Ingrid Michaelson is getting severe play

906
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,560
She's been on the podcast music network for a while

907
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,560
So, good to see you here

908
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,560
And over there

909
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,560
If you were falling

910
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Then I would catch you

911
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,560
You need a light

912
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,560
I'd find a match

913
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,560
Cause I

914
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,560
Oh the way you say good morning

915
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,560
And you

916
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,560
Take me the way I am

917
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,560
If you are chilly

918
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Here take my sweater

919
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,560
Your head is aching

920
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,560
I'll make it better

921
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:13,560
Cause I love the way you call me baby

922
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:20,560
And you take me the way I am

923
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,560
I'd buy your road game

924
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,560
When you start losing all your hair

925
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,560
So I'm patches

926
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,560
To all your tears

927
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,560
To all your tears

928
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:49,560
Cause I love you more than my could never promise

929
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:56,560
And you take me the way I am

930
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,560
You take me the way I am

931
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,560
You take me the way I am

932
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Oh man, love that song

933
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
Ingrid Michaelson

934
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
Take me the way I am

935
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,560
I might play out again this week

936
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,560
That's a really pretty song

937
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
And it's only 2 minutes 15 seconds

938
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,560
And of course the question

939
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,560
In my mind is

940
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,560
What we playing it here first

941
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,560
Or was it mainstream first?

942
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
I mean I really don't keep up with it anymore

943
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,560
That matters to me

944
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,560
Cause just the fact that I can play it

945
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,560
And share it with the audience

946
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
It's great

947
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,560
There is one other song

948
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,560
I want to play for you

949
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,560
Kind of as a bonus coupon

950
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,560
Because my episode

951
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,560
Of pussy the musical is finally out

952
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,560
And this is my contribution to the project

953
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,560
This is snatch

954
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,560
There's a part of me that's thinking

955
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,560
When I'm with the boys out drinking

956
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,560
There's something special

957
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,560
About you, girl

958
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,560
If I'm not thinking about all of you

959
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,560
I'm sure thinking about what of you

960
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,560
Snatch

961
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,560
My heart belongs to you

962
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,560
Snatch

963
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,560
I love you

964
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
I love you

965
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
I love you

966
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,560
Ever with pain

967
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,560
To be snatched by your love

968
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,560
Overwades

969
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,560
Snatch

970
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,560
Snatch

971
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,560
Even if you don't here with me

972
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:48,560
I want to be the one who has this feeling inside of you

973
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,560
If you're just given a link to me

974
00:39:53,560 --> 00:40:00,560
Maybe someday you will see the stage

975
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,560
My heart belongs to you

976
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,560
I love you, darling true

977
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,560
Some guys would probably pay

978
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,560
To be snatched by your love

979
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,560
The way I'm on

980
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,560
If I've been chasing you

981
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,560
Without too much haste

982
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,560
Please grow, don't think that it's in better

983
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,560

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,560
Come on girl, why you say

988
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,560
Let me be such by your love

989
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,560
The way I'm on Sash

990
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,560

991
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,560

I love you, darling true

996
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,560
The signal is gone

997
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Makes me feel gay

998
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,560
