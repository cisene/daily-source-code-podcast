1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Imagine headphones without wires.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,900
Now their Sony's Bluetooth wireless headset, a rechargeable listening experience with 11 hours

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,320
of music playback, so you and your music are free to move.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:23,120
Pick up yours at Sony.com-headphones, Sony wireless headphones, your music are unplugged.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:36,880
You are listening to a man crazy enough to fly without a business card, Adam Curry.

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:44,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strap to my ass, to the next generation renew

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
content in my ears.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I like to think I'm flying into this journey.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:29,340
Don't care about it, crazy me, won't scream, where my words they cut short like a demon

10
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:47,180
decision, I was chillin' my friends with my bad religion, when I was left talking

11
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:57,020
on my television, some me overheat you with this bad religion.

12
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:10,260
While they gathered and screamed and gathered in the place, all he'd better be careful

13
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:24,600
with my pop-up thing, no matter what he says, I don't feel forgive him, somebody, you

14
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,600
have him, please, he got some bad religion.

15
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:24,160
I want you to scream, I just have to be right, what the earth in front of him, I've

16
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:39,440
been a queer, I'm never meant to end it, I've been walking, told me my love and I've

17
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:46,440
been a man, I've been a man, I've been a man, I've been a man, I've been a man, I've been

18
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:58,500
bad religion and I've been a man, I've been a man, I've been a man, I've been a man

19
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:06,980
Zero, six, like Jimmy Branch are kicking on on this Tuesday, January 8th, 2007. Hey, everybody, how you doing?

20
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,260
Oh my goodness. Uh, this is almost the official start of the new year for me.

21
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
You hear that?

22
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,820
You could...

23
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,780
Sorry, uh, got some flim in your ears there, didn't mean to do that.

24
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:31,460
Yeah, it's Tuesday, missed out on yesterday, spent most of the day in Los Petales here in G-Town.

25
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,220
Nothing serious, but also nothing I'm allowed to talk about.

26
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,460
The lady Patricia doesn't want me to say anything.

27
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:47,060
But I'm sure... I'm sure she'll give you details. Hopefully later on in the week as to what was going on.

28
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,340
But everything is fantastic. I'm all alone here in the the curry manner.

29
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,180
Another crappy day, unbelievable. It's just... it's just been... it's been shit.

30
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,740
Oh, maybe it's, uh, let me see. Oh, yeah, it's winter, almost forgot. I kind of forgotten what it was

31
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,420
like to have really crappy crappy weather in the UK, because we've had such a, such a great summer

32
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,700
and almost an Indian summer and man, it's just wet and rainy and Christina went back to school today.

33
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:21,620
After, uh, what is it? What is it with, uh, with these, uh, with these vacations, with these holidays,

34
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,380
unbelievable? I don't, I think she'd been out of school for almost almost a month. Of course,

35
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:33,620
Christmas and New Year's fell on really strange days this year. So, um, I guess that's why stuff

36
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:38,180
just kind of closed now. But I haven't been able to have a decent business meeting, nothing at all

37
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:46,580
until finally starting out this week and, uh, and, uh, well, here we are. I feel like crap.

38
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,500
I got to tell you this, uh, this flu, which, uh, had had, I guess it's still kind of reaching

39
00:05:52,500 --> 00:06:00,820
epidemic proportions. It's the, the no-row virus, or, um, as some would say, the Norwalk like virus,

40
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,700
which usually attacks people on cruise ships. Uh, it's just running rampant. I mean, you can't

41
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:12,260
get a single person on the phone. They're all sick. They're all home and, uh, and, uh, it's, uh,

42
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,860
it's messed up. And I've been thinking that, uh, in this new year, um, I want to do a

43
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,660
couple of things differently with the show. I'm, uh, it's still kind of running shit through my brain,

44
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,060
trying to figure it out. Uh, obviously the topics that we've been hitting on in the past, uh,

45
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,220
a couple weeks or actually a couple months have, uh, have really increased the, uh, the, uh, the

46
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:39,300
the listenership, the audience has grown significantly, um, you know, the conversations have been, uh,

47
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,740
turning to, uh, well, I want to steer a little bit away from, uh, from the conspiracy theories. I,

48
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,660
you know, when I was ill, uh, if, if you heard, um, uh, Noah Jenda, uh, the one that, uh,

49
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,140
John DeBorek and I did on, uh, on Friday, he even warned me. He said, you know, you really got to

50
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,700
watch out watching all of those, uh, conspiracy videos because you can really go nuts. And I think I was

51
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,300
kind of going just a little bit freaky, uh, because you get into this, this spiral of, um, my god,

52
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,700
there's no fixing it. There's nothing we can do. And, and actually there's, uh, there's a lot

53
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,740
of hope out there. There's a lot of amazing things happening, uh, throughout the world. I also want

54
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:21,300
to concentrate a little bit on the UK. Um, in fact, uh, I, I got a, uh, I was nice to see as I went through

55
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,660
the, uh, the voicemail, uh, messages that, uh, there were a lot of calls coming in from, uh, from the

56
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,780
UK. And this is one that I kind of expected a while ago, but finally someone's asking the question.

57
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:38,100
I add, um, it's, uh, Adrian Pack from London here, a very long time listener. I was just wondering

58
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:44,100
if you might, um, do as a big favor for your non-American listeners, and, and explain how the American

59
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,340
race for the White House works. I mean, words like caucuses and primaries, they don't really mean anything

60
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,380
to me. And I, and I, and I, I'm really very confused about who's competing with who and whether it's

61
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,100
Democrats looking for a representative of the Democrats or whether they're all fighting each other

62
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:06,260
or I'm where was wrong polling. I, well, I don't get it. Uh, can you, um, can you, can you help me out

63
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:11,620
here? Um, and get well soon. I hope you feel better. I love you. Bye.

64
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,500
Hi, I love you, too, Adrian. Thanks, man. Yeah, you know, it is extremely confusing. And quite

65
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,100
honestly, I think that a lot of people, uh, Americans probably don't understand. In, in fact,

66
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,940
I'm probably not even qualified to explain exactly how it worked, but, um, the main thing that's

67
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:34,180
going on right now is that, uh, and this is just an observation from my part, is that the media has

68
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:41,220
grabbed onto this primary in, you know, like there's nothing else going on in the world, um, and

69
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:48,020
by the way, there is quite a lot of shit going on in the world, um, that it almost feels like we're,

70
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:55,220
you know, we're going to be, uh, electing a president next week, you know, and, uh, and, and

71
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,020
almost feels like, oh, well, the race is over. It's clear that, uh, Obama is going to be the winner.

72
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,420
That's, it's just the way it comes across. And, and I think that, uh, the sooner we all realize that

73
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,620
this is a very long process. In fact, it's the longest process ever I believe in history,

74
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,420
because all these primaries have started early. Let me just try and give it a, uh, a brief

75
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,460
stab. Essentially, the United States has a two-party system. You have the Democrats, and you have

76
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:27,940
the Republicans, two different, uh, I mean, really, the same two different sides of the same coin.

77
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:34,900
I guess you could almost say, um, but they're two parties, and they stand for different things.

78
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:41,700
It's, uh, it's kind of hard to even, um, segregate the two these days when you listen to all the messages,

79
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,580
almost sounds like everyone is saying pretty much the same thing. A change is always the big

80
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:54,660
word. Everybody wants to change. But, um, you know, in a contrary to, uh, probably popular belief

81
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:00,580
around, uh, most of the world, the, um, it's not a popular vote. So it's not like whoever gets the

82
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:08,740
most votes wins the presidency. Uh, it, uh, it's divided up by, um, by delegates. And, uh, each state

83
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:16,740
has a number of delegates assigned to it. Uh, uh, that is determined by the size of the state.

84
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:25,060
And, um, you have, uh, uh, I see, I'm, I'm, you know what, can somebody please explain this to my British

85
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:34,180
friends? But anyway, the idea is that first, each party decides who their, um, Canada is going to be.

86
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,900
And once that is done and this, uh, essentially, uh, this process goes all the way through, uh,

87
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:47,860
well, through the next several months, I think it even goes, uh, well into the summer, uh,

88
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:54,180
where, uh, states will be determining, okay, this is our guy from the selection of guys for this party.

89
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:01,540
And so what we should wind up with somewhere around November is, uh, two tickets. Uh, one ticket will be

90
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,700
the, uh, Democratic ticket, one will be the Republican ticket. Uh, excuse me, you can tell

91
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:13,460
up so aggravated, just trying to explain it to myself is difficult. Uh, and the ticket will consist

92
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:19,060
of a presidential candidate and a vice presidential candidate. Now, you can imagine that you have all

93
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,100
of these, these parties and all these states and these are basically little clubs. And, uh, there's

94
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:32,180
a lot of backroom, you know, jocking back and forth and, um, to essentially come up with the, um,

95
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:39,220
with the right amount of votes to present the candidate. Am I butchering this? I think I am actually,

96
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:45,860
and maybe I should just stop. But right now, we're just in this primary and the primary, um,

97
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:51,540
the whole point is to come up with the candidates for each party. There can also be a, uh, uh,

98
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,860
you couldn't have, be an independent candidate. Uh, I don't think we have any, uh, at the

99
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,980
moment. I'm sure there are some, but the whole thing is basically messed up because what you're

100
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:10,340
seeing is without mainstream media exposure, you're, you're almost irrelevant in the conversation,

101
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:20,100
even though when it comes down to the votes, that's really all that counts. So when you look at,

102
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:28,020
well, uh, obviously, uh, there was, uh, very little about Ron Paul in, in Iowa,

103
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,420
although he did get 10% of the vote. Now, let me just explain, I'm just going to just take a

104
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,980
step, man, I wish I had someone to help me with this because it's such a complicated process.

105
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,740
Someone's got a call and be able to do this in three minutes or less to explain how it works.

106
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,380
So all of these states have to make their decisions for their candidates for, for each party.

107
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:55,540
Some states, I think it's five of them, uh, have an old fashioned way of making this determination.

108
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,540
Instead of just going in and, and, you know, just having a regular vote, you go into the voting

109
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,180
booth, you say, here's the guy that I think should be, um, the nominee for the party that I'm

110
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,540
registered to, which is another whole, uh, part of the equation. You have to be a registered

111
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:15,620
Republican if you want to vote, uh, to choose, uh, the Republican candidate or Democrat, obviously.

112
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:21,700
Uh, some of these, uh, some of these states have an old system, which is called the caucus.

113
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:27,140
And I think really it stems from, you know, way back in the day, uh, when, uh, when people would

114
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,020
sit around in a room and they, uh, you know, they go back and forth and, you know, when things were

115
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:38,100
much, much smaller and they'd have a specific way of choosing. Uh, and it was basically like, you know,

116
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,420
if, if you're for this guy, you stand in that corner, if you're for that guy, you stand in that corner,

117
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,020
and you have to come up with the majority. If you don't come for the majority, then you could change

118
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,660
your vote. It's, uh, it's a, it's a very convoluted system. But in general, for most of the states,

119
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,620
it's just based on, on pure voting and depending on the size of the state, that is the amount

120
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:04,660
of delegates that will be voting in the presidential, uh, election. I think, had Jesus, I don't know.

121
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:11,140
At the end of the day, when you win, you get stolen away from you. So, uh, but it is fascinating

122
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,900
to watch how it's being covered, and particularly was not being covered.

123
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:21,620
Adam, during Chris and Levittown, first, you need to stop it. The caucuses were a huge success.

124
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:32,420
10 percent, uh, nobody, somebody completely, utterly and totally ignored by major media.

125
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:38,740
Intentionally blackout by major media got 10 percent of the vote in the first caucus. That's

126
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:44,740
phenomenal. I was hoping for 15 percent, the 10 percent is still incredible. Think about that.

127
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:53,940
With no support from major media whatsoever, we were able to convert online presence is with 10

128
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:01,540
percent physical vote in the caucuses. That's incredible. That's amazing. I have huge high hopes

129
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,940
for the coming New Hampshire election. I don't think you'll win it, no, of course not. But I think

130
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,460
we're going to build on it, and I think it's going to work good. And you've got to push.

131
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,820
The online presence can be a finicky presence. We have to continue to push to convert the

132
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,700
online presence into a boots on the ground presence. Major media is not going to help us. They're

133
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,340
going to actively fight us. They're going to actively ignore us. They do not want wrong calls

134
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,460
away. They want to blight him out as much as possible. Every time you hear them on the news,

135
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,220
what's more of the things you hear every single time. So, they're going to run as dependent.

136
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,260
They've already put forth the notion you've lost, you have no chance that you're going to

137
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:44,180
run as dependent. The message is starting to people. The message is that you already have no chance.

138
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:50,260
So, we have to do with the brute force way. We have to force people online to motivate,

139
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,580
to mobilize, to try to get this guy elected, but see on the way it's going to work.

140
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:00,180
10 percent in the Iowa caucus, only 300, 56,000 people voted. That's amazing. That's absolutely

141
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:05,300
incredible. Over 11,000 people came out for those who are on ball in what 10 below zero

142
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:12,500
weather. I am very, very impressed. I think it's a win. A huge win. And I think you and Ron Paul

143
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,020
make it a big mistake if you push it as such. It really is a win. See you later, Ron Paul.

144
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:27,220
That's not true. Out of pressure. Oh, man. You're way into it. Yeah. So, you know, so that is what

145
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:33,700
really a big part of, is really a big part of the problem is that the zeitgeist or or what is

146
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,580
top of mind, what is being discussed is really the only thing that seems to matter. And it's

147
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:45,460
hard for me. This is what I struggle with every single day. You know, if it's not on television,

148
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:52,420
does it matter? Does it make a difference? And I think it does. And honestly, I hope that we see

149
00:16:52,580 --> 00:17:00,660
much bigger, much more than even the 10% in Iowa. I have no idea this being Tuesday morning in

150
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:07,060
the UK. I have no idea how new Hampshire is going. But again, these are just two of the 50 states.

151
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,940
You know, so there's a lot more that's still to come. But what does happen in a lot of these

152
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:18,900
a lot of these primaries is this is where, you know, the men are separated from the boys, so to speak.

153
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:26,180
And, you know, candidates that get absolutely no traction at all, a lot of them will drop off some of

154
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:34,820
them. You know, I mean, look at what's happening right now with the Democratic party, where Obama

155
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:41,940
just seems to be, you know, pulling ahead like a bad out of hell, just completely on fire as,

156
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:49,540
you know, hope, I think people are on the Democratic side are putting, you know, a lot of energy

157
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:58,500
and a lot of hope into this candidate. And it's just phenomenal to watch. And the media takes this

158
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:05,220
and spins it in a way that, you know, makes it look like Hillary Clinton is, you know, is almost dead

159
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,460
in the water and ready to drop out. I mean, to me, it is convoluted the entire process and

160
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,300
honestly, I really don't know what to think myself anymore. The end of the day,

161
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:21,380
it's got to come down to the votes. And the only way to, you know, I guess to really get the votes up is

162
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:27,140
to have a presence. And, you know, stuff like the Ron Paul money bomb gets, gets press, it gets people

163
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:33,220
interested. People start talking about it. But even here in the UK, you know, if I walk down the street

164
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:39,460
and I ask 10 people who was Ron Paul, I bet you that 10 out of 10 have no idea who he is.

165
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,180
No, I don't know, it's Mike Turner here, currently in Swindon. He is a go-mem. No,

166
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:49,780
there's a lot of people with go-mem. Do you have politics? Listen, I'm ready to form a radio

167
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:56,820
five and whatever, the world service. No mention of Ron Paul whatsoever. Absolutely not the

168
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,220
soul. It's in Barack Obama, this Barack Obama, this, and the, and what is an

169
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:06,820
idea that he's a who's in X, anyway. First, I thought for the BBC, there's no mention at all

170
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,780
of the, of Dr. Ron Paul. What's going on with the BBC, if it's just mainstream,

171
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:18,820
very crap, I take it. There's a, or BBC talk, like the red, and fixing things.

172
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:24,100
Obviously, BBC don't have a BBC, you have to have on the US elections. There are a people

173
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,860
listening out of it, or you're suddenly at the, on the United States side.

174
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:35,620
Uh, there's just a thought, not the sound of you. Uh, I can't gag. Yeah, fine.

175
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,220
Oh, oh, you, you're this.

176
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:50,180
Man, I don't know if I can complete a whole show. You know, I want to do some live shows this year.

177
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:56,420
I really do. I got a look into my streaming setup. You know, I'm kind of tired of the delayed

178
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,860
response. I just want to talk to people live. I feel that I'm much better when I'm in conversation

179
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,340
with someone. Whenever I'm talking to Patricia, whenever I'm talking to someone like John C. Devorac,

180
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:11,940
it just, it seems to work a lot better for me. So, um, if you're flexible, I'm certainly flexible.

181
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:18,340
We can, uh, we can figure it out. We can do something with some live streaming and recorded for, uh,

182
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:26,100
for the podcast. Um, yeah, going on. I think you're right. You know, it's, uh, it is just a

183
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,420
bunch of mainstream crap. You know, the, the news only has so much time that they're willing to

184
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,540
devote to, uh, to talking about stuff. And they only want to talk about stuff that everyone else is talking

185
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:43,780
about. And, uh, it, uh, I'm really disappointed with just how it all fits together and how it all works.

186
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:50,900
And I'm becoming a little bit, uh, cynical. I think about the entire process. Uh, so we have to continue

187
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:57,220
to, uh, to work very hard. Uh, I, as you know, I believe in the, uh, in the constitutional message of

188
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:03,460
freedom that Ron Paul is, uh, is preaching. So, I will continue to, uh, to support Ron Paul continue

189
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,900
to motivate people to read about his message. Even though it's not on mainstream, you know,

190
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:14,900
go to Ron Paul 2008.com, read some of the articles, read what he's about, learn about the

191
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:21,860
constitution. Um, even if you're not an American, you know, it's, uh, it behooves you to understand

192
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:28,020
what the country originally stood for only, uh, 200 plus years ago. And, uh, definitely the direction

193
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:35,700
I think we should look at taking again. What's kind of nice to see that, uh, how it's stern is now

194
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,740
catching on to, uh, to Ron Paul. I'm, I'm sure, uh, most of you know who how it's stern is, although he

195
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,220
hasn't been on terrestrial radio for, uh, well, what is it now? Like two years at least,

196
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,220
he's, of course, on satellite radio in the US, check this out. This came across the

197
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,260
whole party. He used to be welding. I don't know if he really wants it. Ron Paul, I'm going to

198
00:21:54,260 --> 00:22:00,580
tell you about this guy, Ron Paul. He's fantastic. The Republicans for some reason, they laughing

199
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:08,660
them all the time, but meanwhile, he did pretty good in Iowa. This guy is a Republican, and he says,

200
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:15,300
listen, I become president. I'm taking us out of Iraq. I'm taking us out of everywhere in the

201
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:20,500
world. He goes, what good has it done us? Being in this, and these fucking Middle Eastern countries.

202
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,460
They all hate it because they hate us. I'm taking us out of all these wars, and we're done. He goes,

203
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,860
and I'm not an isolationist. I'm not afraid to use the military where it's needed. But he said to

204
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,660
sit in here and these extended fucking wars, train the economy and he goes, and if we stay,

205
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:41,380
or we leave, the same guy damn thing happens. Nothing. So let's leave, and people love this guy

206
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:49,220
when he talks. He's makes sense. Well, we're, we're the votes. I don't know who this guy is.

207
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,820
I heard him speak. I heard him speak. I heard him speak, and I said, this guy should be

208
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:06,340
getting more airtime. Hi Adam, it's Matt from Gamesweasel. On this week's show, the first of the

209
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,740
new year we'll be looking at Uncharted, Drake's fortune on the PlayStation 3. Lego Star Wars,

212
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:37,340
I am a bitch. I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I know what I want, i'm a bitch. I'm a bitch overall

213
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,140
like a prince, I've guessed it down. I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch,

214
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,860
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch. Alright, now unseaved and get some

215
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,580
Some earplugs, I've got a microphone.

216
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,580
Oh.

217
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,580
Oh.

218
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,580
Oh.

219
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,580
Oh.

220
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,580
Oh.

221
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,580
Oh.

222
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,580
Oh.

223
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,580
Oh.

224
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,580
Oh.

225
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,580
Oh.

226
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,580
Excuse me.

227
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,580
That's my butt.

228
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,220
You're commenting on funny.

229
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:10,700
I don't recall asking for your opinion on my body.

230
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,820
Get your words off of me.

231
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,220
Now.

232
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,860
Now.

233
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,860
I'm a bitch.

234
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,820
I'm a bitch.

235
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,340
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch.

236
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,820
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch.

237
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,820
I'm a bitch.

238
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,860
I'm a bitch.

239
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,580
I'm a bitch.

240
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,300
I'm a bitch.

241
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,300
I'm a bitch.

242
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,300
I'm a bitch.

243
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,300
I'm a bitch.

244
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
I'm a bitch.

245
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,300
I'm a bitch.

246
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,300
I work for your company here.

247
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:52,300
That's my desk writing the corner.

248
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:57,300
I make 10,000 less a year.

249
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,300
Then my mail partners.

250
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,300
Is it because of the bra that I wear?

251
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,300
Hey, me groidly now.

252
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,300
Now.

253
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:17,300
I'm a bitch.

254
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,300
I'm a bitch but now what do I want?

255
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,300
I'm a bitch.

256
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,300
I can't step down.

257
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,300
I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm

258
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,300
from my toes.

259
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,300
Like a man, like a man, I'm going to let the whole world know.

260
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,300
And I'll be labeled, do you know what my people are scared?

261
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,300
But I've got to speak up anyway, because I don't really care.

262
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
It's a woman.

263
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,300
I'm a woman.

264
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,300
I'm a woman.

265
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,300
I know what I want.

266
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,300
I'm a woman.

267
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,300
I'm a woman.

268
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,300
Then I won't let myself get stepped on.

269
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
I'm a woman.

270
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,300
I'm a woman.

271
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,300
Then I'm going to make myself know.

272
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,300
And I've been inviting all the people to share my life.

273
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,300
Bye, lifelong.

274
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,300
Hi, Kristen Kitko.

275
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,300
The bitch song.

276
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,300
Thanks to Sir Jersey Todd for pointing that one out to me.

277
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,300
He actually sent in his email, he said, hey, this could be a great one for a Hillary Clinton.

278
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,300
Oh, like a no man.

279
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,300
I just kind of like the song from The Pod Safety Music Network, of course.

280
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,300
And you'll find links to that in the show notes at DailySourceCode.com

281
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,300
Well,

282
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,700
I'm kind of empty, you know, I'm lacking inspiration today.

283
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,340
All that's going on in the news is frickin' presidential race,

284
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,740
which is just driving me up the wall, driving me nuts.

285
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,580
I want to talk about some other things.

286
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,900
That's some just some general stuff.

287
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:56,020
Is it just me or is the world spinning three times faster than normal?

288
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,540
Maybe it is just me.

289
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,020
But I'd like to make some changes in 2008,

290
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,780
just in our own little world here.

291
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,220
Let's talk about some other shit.

292
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,020
Let's have some fun.

293
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,380
Let's get creative.

294
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,060
And what I'll do today is I'm going to look into different ways

295
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,220
to doing some live streaming,

296
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,540
so we can take some, well, not live calls,

297
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,340
but we can do some kind of live conversation.

298
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,380
Just not quite sure how I want to do it yet.

299
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,420
There's a number of different technologies available.

300
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,980
Well, let me work on it.

301
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,180
Let me figure it out.

302
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,380
If you have any ideas posted in the comments,

303
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,980
at dailysourcecode.com,

304
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,940
let me know what you think might work.

305
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,540
One thing's for sure.

306
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,860
I'm going to have to announce when I'm going to actually record,

307
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,860
so that folks can hop on and get involved.

308
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,660
And let's just give it a try.

309
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,940
Let's just do some different.

310
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,940
I just really want to do something different.

311
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,820
Something different, for instance,

312
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,380
like rolling out a jersey Todd song,

313
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,060
even though it's not a food bar Friday?

314
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,060
You're on her.

315
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:02,020
I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out.

316
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,260
You're on her.

317
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,900
Please don't bang that gavel.

318
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,100
You can try this cowbell out.

319
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,660
Let's all give up night.

320
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,580
To the hardest work in law here.

321
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,580
It's jersey time.

322
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,100
Yeah, yeah.

323
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
It's jersey time.

324
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,300
Oh, yeah.

325
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,700
You're on it.

326
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,060
What do you say?

327
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,660
Yo, how's it going?

328
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,700
Adam, it's jersey time.

329
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,100
The official musicologist of the Chacha.

330
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,340
So, dude, big man.

331
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,580
AC, dude, dude, dude.

332
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,500
Have I got something for you right now?

333
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,220
It's one of my all time favorite bands.

334
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,940
I'm flipping out that they're on the pot safe music network.

335
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,220
The black crows.

336
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:45,940
That's right.

337
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,020
The black friggin' crows.

338
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,380
It's time to shake your money,

339
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,620
make your and tell them work or that you love them.

340
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,180
I am thoroughly psyched that they're on the PMN today

341
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,820
because they've got a brand new album coming out in March.

342
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,940
It's called Warp Paint.

343
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,060
I'm really looking forward to it.

344
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,780
It's their first studio album in seven years.

345
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,700
And they posted a track on the pod safe music network.

346
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,780
I'm telling you, the revolution is here.

347
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,980
And this is the black crows with goodbye daughters of the revolution.

348
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,780
Check it out.

349
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,060
The black crows on the DSC can't beat this.

350
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,700
Do you see me are there?

351
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,860
There sure will be me, I got a can come back there.

352
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,340
Ah, the right and the right kid home.

353
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,520
Ah.

354
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,980
If you see me, there's no way they'll be there.

355
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,340
It's all right.

356
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,340
I've got something for them.

357
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,100
Ah.

358
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,620
I can't help but chance I can't

359
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,620
Don't you want from a nifty bed but now

360
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:04,620
Take it easy, to avoid it, it's next

361
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:09,620
Because I'm not a summer ever mission

362
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,620
I can't even see your future

363
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:18,620
I will know you come, God, to kill me

364
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:24,620
Keep on, I'll run into the gate of the city

365
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:28,620
Give up now with me, sir, to pity

366
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:33,620
Don't you want to see the ship go down with me

367
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,620
Where are you?

368
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,620
I can't do it for me now, go to your side

369
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,620
I'll come around midnight to your back door

370
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,620
I'll run into the gate of the city

371
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,620
I'll cross your head

372
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,620
Run you, run into the edge of your age

373
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:07,620
When the sun goes away, it's gonna snow, your stage

374
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,620
Give me help, leave the guilty group of the shock

375
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,620
And see the ship go down with me

376
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,620
Because I'm not a summer ever mission

377
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,620
I can't even see your future

378
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,620
I will know you come, God, to kill me

379
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:33,620
Keep on, I'll run into the gate of the city

380
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,620
Give up now with me, sir, to pity

381
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:42,620
Don't you want to see the ship go down with me

382
00:31:43,620 --> 00:32:00,620
Keep on, I'll run into the gate of the city

383
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,620
When the sun goes away, it's gonna snow, your stage

384
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,620
I'll be around, go to your side

385
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:14,620
I'll be around, go to your side

386
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,620
I'll be around, go to your side

387
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,620
I'll be around, go to your side

388
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,620
I'll be around, go to your side

389
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:31,620
I'll be around, go to your side

390
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,620
Keep on, I'll run into the gate of the city

391
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,620
Give up now with me, sir, to pity

392
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,620
Don't you want to see the ship go down with me

393
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,620
Keep on, I'll run into the gate of the city

394
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,620
Keep on, I'll be around, go to your side

395
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,620
Keep on, I'll be around, go to your side

396
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,620
Chris Robinson, the only guy who has to run around

397
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,620
I'm the shower to actually get wet

398
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,620
Black pros

399
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,620
Goodbye daughters of the revolution

400
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,620
Unbelievable, it's Podsake

401
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,620
Love that

402
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:17,620
That's right, the revolution clearly

403
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,620
It's well underway

404
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,620
As the music business changes right before your very eyes

405
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,620
The smart guys are doing it

406
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,620
All right everybody

407
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,620
I'm just gonna stop the show right here now

408
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,620
Because I'm empty, I'm done

409
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,620
I have no more energy left

410
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,620
Let's think about some ways we can change this show

411
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,620
For the coming year

412
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,620
I want to keep the conversations going

413
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,620
But I want to talk to more people

414
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,620
I'm tired of speaking to myself in a vacuum

415
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,620
So let me, yeah, give me your ideas

416
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,620

Just for you

Another podshow podcast

421
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,620
Stick it in your ear

422
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,620
Make a statement with Saudi stereo ear buds

423
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,620
Sleep metal housings that reduce vibration

424
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,620
Delivering killer sound from a tiny package

425
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,620
Buy yours at Sony.com slash headphones

426
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,620
Sony earbuds

427
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,620
Where style meets sound
