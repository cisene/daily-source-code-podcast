1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Delta Sierra Charli, 808.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,480
Daddy, what's it gonna be like in the year 2000?

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,360
Well sweetheart, for your sake I hope it'll be all peaches and cream, but I'm afraid

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,640
the end time is near.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,520
The cataclysmic apocalypse referred to in the scriptures of every holy book known to

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,520
mankind.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,080
It will be an era fraught with boundless greed and corruption, where global monetary systems

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,280
disintegrate leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of overcooked rice.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,680
The nations of the civilized world will collapse under the oppressive weight of parasitic

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,160
political conspiracies which remove all hope and optimism from their once-faithful

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,160
citizens.

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,080
Around the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins.

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,280
Unshielded by the ozone layer they have successfully depleted, left to bake in the

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,040
searing naked rays of light, wholesale assassination served to destabilize every remaining

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,680
government, leaving the starving and wicked defend for themselves.

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,600
Late Thursday, Renegade Cyborgs created by tax dodging corporations wreak havoc, pissed off

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,160
and brought its tired of being slaves to a godless and gutless system, where the rich

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,400
get richer and the poor get fucked over and out, unleash total worldwide destruction by

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,840
means of nuclear holocaust, annihilating the carafide masses, leaving in its torturous

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,400
weight nothing but vicious, carnivalistic, mutated, radiate, and horribly disfigured

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,880
the cords of Satan, the killings, bent on revenge, but against them there are so few left

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,880
alive.

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,160
Starvation reigns supreme, forcing unlocky subargesting anything in any uninterpath, massive

24
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,760
earthquake scrap the planet's crust like hollow eggshell causing unending volcanic eruptions,

25
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,600
creatures of the seven seas unable to escape to certain earth upon land, boil and

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,560
alert the person, disease and surface the earth, plates and viruses with no known cause,

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,280
or cure a flame waste to whatever does, but, and you and John had improved himself to be

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,200
helping more of the race of hopeless scavengers, fall victim to merciless attack evanes,

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,200
a hundred-pointed array of injuries, and seek to control the watch over the ants, this extinction

30
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,560
nothing of ant, the final world front, and there is only one year left.

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, that's cool, I can hardly wait.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You don't have to, because here it is.

33
00:03:47,560 --> 00:04:17,560
You don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have

34
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:47,560
to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you

35
00:04:47,560 --> 00:05:17,560
don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to, because you don't have to,

36
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

37
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:55,400
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh eh eh, eh, eh ohÃ©nari.

38
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,400
It's Charlie coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey, known as Gilford, run a west side of G-town

39
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Thanks to good fun of the show Ray for helping me prep today's program for you

40
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,400
And of course thanks to Gilford coach Red Bull and not a music for give me permission to play this one

41
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Bombay, of course, playing that in recognition and in memory of those hurt and

42
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:26,400
And the families of those hurt and killed in the attacks in Mumbai, also known as Bombay

43
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Oh man, isn't that just horrible? I'm always little bit suspicious though

44
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,400
We've had several attacks and bombings and explosions take place in the last couple of years

45
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,400
And only when they immediately say it's a terrorist attack, do I get really suspicious?

46
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Because usually you don't hear about it, you know, it's just something blew up, something happened

47
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
But it's not a terrorist, this immediately was a terrorist attack

48
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,400
I'm reading in fact in the times online in the UK

49
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Saying that they were Islamic terrorists, okay, so they know a lot already, apparently within just hours

50
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Of a taking place and of a, oh man, it's messed up. So I'm a little worried that this may be some kind of play

51
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Of course, the attack is real and what happened is real. I'm a little bit worried that this could be

52
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Be used to do something nasty to Pakistan, which I believe is pretty much been on the agenda for a couple hundred years

53
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Hey, it's Thanksgiving of Thanksgiving as my family likes to say in the United States of America

54
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:38,400
The day we all actually the one of the holidays I enjoy most because it truly is still recognized as a time to get together with family

55
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Sit down enjoy a meal together. Of course the origins are somewhat different

56
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:57,400
At least we were all taught the story goes that we sat down with the Indians and we made a feast with corn and turkey and we were happy and thankful to our friends the Native American Indians

57
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,400
In reality, I'm sure it was a little bit different, but anyway, I love the holiday because everything's closed

58
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,400
There's no gift giving on the holiday itself people bring food people cook for each other travel

59
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Hundreds if not thousands of miles to be with their families and we have a very strong tradition of that in our family

60
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:27,400
And unfortunately, I can't be there this year, but but Patricia and Christina have always enjoyed going up to going up to the homestead there in our month New York

61
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,400
So I'm happy Thanksgiving to all of my family who are listening and

62
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,400
We do have a lot to be thankful for even though I mean I got a list here

63
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,400
I have a list of links that is and when I do wish I did a show on Monday

64
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:55,400
It's only three days the list is outrageous. I can't even get to every single piece on the list, but I am outside of the the obvious being thankful for health and for family being in good health

65
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Mostly in good health, I should say

66
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
I'm thankful for drop.io

67
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:14,400
I really am what a fantastic system. It's hard to pinpoint how a web application is going to work and when the the guys behind drop.io started I think their idea was to have some kind of

68
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:24,400
The basics of the idea was it's anonymous is no registration you can keep it private or not very simple. It can auto destroy you can get rid of something quickly

69
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,400
It's not index big by Google, which I like very much although it sounds counterintuitive. I love it

70
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Mainly because there's less spam, there's no comment spam

71
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:41,400
And the community stays a little bit more closed. I don't necessarily want people searching and then coming into our drop because

72
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,400
You need to be eased into that. You need to have some kind of background or understanding of what's happening

73
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Or you just hit there and go what the hell is this? This is a bunch of nut cases

74
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,400
And it's those nut cases those chuckle heads out there hundreds of thousands strong

75
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Not quite a million yet, but hundreds of thousands strong on a on a weekly basis who are contributing who are awake

76
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:15,400
So to speak, who are participating in the awakening of others helping them see the true reality and the drop really functions is a great central meeting place

77
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:24,400
It's kind of a weblog a wiki a forum all built into one. They just did a whole new redesign. If you haven't seen it drop.io slash daily source code

78
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Feel free to join in. So most of the links are from from the drop. Of course, I'm also very very happy with the worldwide web in general the internet

79
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Tim Berners Lee mark and recent

80
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,400
I guess see even go back to what's his name Bob Medkath

81
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Winvented to Ethernet Vincent surf all these guys

82
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:57,400
And that is our true salvation. I was thinking about this, you know, and I don't know if we do we have don't think we have any

83
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Oh, yeah, there is some Australian internet filtering news that I'll get to about halfway through the show

84
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:10,400
But knowing you have to understand that there are hundreds of thousands of

85
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,400
skilled workers

86
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:26,400
You could call them IT specialist or you could call them system admins, but in general a lot of them listen to this show not hundreds of thousands of them, but tons of them

87
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:34,400
These are the true heroes that will keep us alive keep our communications alive. I mean, I do want to get into it now, but

88
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:43,400
There will always the network that was built and which Al Gore foolishly took to credit for which is okay because that means his

89
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,400
His energy at least power friends will but just only have more reason to be pissed off at him

90
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Because they truly did build it in a way that

91
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Even physical destruction of portions of the network just will not take away the communication capabilities of it. Now we may have to jump through hoops

92
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:16,400
And we may have to go around around fire walls and through tunnels and gosh knows what else, but there's almost no stopping it and that of course is what we need to use and we are using it in exactly that manner, not just with the show, but other things like

93
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Like the drop

94
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,400
All right, should we get straight into it then? Because as I said, there's just a ton to do

95
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Let me start off with some news from the world of medicine and science and again, all of these links are in the show notes a daily source code dot com or crosspost that at curie dot com

96
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,400
This is and I read this on pop of a wired

97
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:50,400
But it's like nothing new there of the 33 new drugs approved by the food and drug administration in 2001

98
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:59,400
2002 one fifth of supporting clinical trials were not published in medical journals according to a new study. There's a nice link there the results

99
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,400
They were published were often more positive than what companies presented to the FDA and their applications

100
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,400
In fact, most of the negative trials are never published

101
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:17,400
I'm trying to we've we've talked a lot about this we've talked to particularly as it pertains to vaccinations

102
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,400
My biggest or current pet peeve

103
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Or our outrage is directed at the makers of guardazil and was at service

104
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,400
These so called ovarian cancer prevention vaccine, which was poorly tested rushed onto the market

105
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,400
The already built up in the pipeline of these two drug companies

106
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:47,400
They've coerced the government into making it mandatory or governments making it mandatory in many countries or in certain situations

107
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,400
And it winds up hurting people hurting people and killing them

108
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,400
And it's not like this this isn't mainstream information think of viox

109
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Which was pulled from the market after killing 27,000 people through heart attacks a side effect that was glossed over in the company studies

110
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Right on the heels of that is kind of frightening news

111
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,400
And we talked a lot about the avian bird flu and this is going to be another vaccine they're going to start offering it

112
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
I hope the god they don't try to make it mandatory

113
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:37,400
synthetic virus supports a bat origin for SARS while we all remember SARS right severe acute respiratory syndrome, which came and went

114
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Bubbubbum kill people who was gone

115
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
So we needed to kill more people

116
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,400
SARS establishes response strategy for emerging infections

117
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,400
I mean this is a setup. It's a wind up the drug companies already you can look at their annual reports

118
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
I love looking at annual reports because

119
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:05,400
You know this shit you tell your shareholders better be true because you get called on it if you're a public company once a quarter and otherwise other intervals

120
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,400
And there's billions of dollars in the pipeline in other words what the drug companies are expecting to make

121
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,400
With vaccinations for pandemic flu so basically what they're doing is they're creating the virus

122
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Under the guise of

123
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Yeah, we just need to get the antidote, but they're creating viruses and I mean I thought this until I was a little kid before I even knew what the hell was going on in the world

124
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,400
I always thought maybe it's a part of my mind that is business like

125
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,400
And maybe the same moment in the part of my mind that's evil and maybe that's two sides of the same coin

126
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
But I always thought to myself well man, you know whenever

127
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Whenever it's winter time it all seems like all around the same couple of weeks

128
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,400
There's all these ads for the flu and for you know

129
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Flu-like symptoms

130
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
And I always thought to myself you know I did that those fuckers

131
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,400
I'd probably just like thrown shit in the atmosphere and then they give you the the flu medicine

132
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
And the advertising on television. It's always perfectly timed

133
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:10,400
And since I was maybe 14 I was thinking this and now of course I know that you know these things actually do happen

134
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,400
And we're ramping up. We're ramping up for the bird flu mark my words

135
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Some disturbing news after we heard about the melamine which was found in baby food and formula from China

136
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Here they are again the FDA has said it found trace levels of melamine

137
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,400
In one sample they took of US made infant formula

138
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:44,400
And a few samples of other products like nutritional medical supplements made by US manufacturers of infant formula

139
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,400
But of course the FDA says literally right here. This is the Wall Street Journal

140
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:58,400
It's safe. These are extremely low levels. It's safe. It didn't cause any concern at all not from a health standpoint. No of course not

141
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,400
I got to talk to John C. to work about this over the weekend

142
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,400
I'll get a kick out of that of course that's poison as it has no business being in our food

143
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
And it's used to up the protein count

144
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
That's why it's it's a scam

145
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
The FDA says the melamine

146
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Is safe to eat below 2.5 parts per million. Maybe it is but it shouldn't be there at all

147
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Should be no reason

148
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,400
The only reason it's in there is to up the I think it's the protein count something like that

149
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,400
There was a reason for it that had to do with what basically what you can put on the label

150
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,400
And it's it's severely hurting kids

151
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,400
I had a great discussion with the lady Patricia this morning who had a was like she had a four day

152
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,400
Stint in the in the Netherlands. She's going back tomorrow and actually I'm going over for the weekend

153
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,400
As she's doing a huge benefit

154
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Children's benefit which is it's one of these extremely high society parties

155
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,400
With the the 500 richest people of the country and then us

156
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,400
I'm taking my buddy Michelle over as well. He'll get a kick out of it

157
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Any so there's a it's a huge to do there's a silent auction which usually raises a lot of money

158
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:30,400
You know, it's all about the arts, et cetera, it's for the Lilliana phones which you probably won't recognize but it's a children's charity

159
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Which has been around for a long time and they asked Patricia if because you know Patricia doesn't sing right she only sings

160
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,400
In really two cases she'll sing for a lot of money

161
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Or she'll sing for free if it's for the right reason and this is one of those

162
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,400
65 piece orchestra her dad is going to a company her on violin on one song

163
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,400
I think she's doing smile the Charlie Chaplin classic

164
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Trying to think what else she's doing she's doing New York New York

165
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
And I can't remember

166
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Anyway, so the telling you we're talking about Holland and

167
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,400
And her impressions but of course you know when she's over there she you know she kind of dips her toe in the water

168
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:21,400
And this is it is really nice to be able to travel around the different countries within Europe or the globe in general

169
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
And just you know here how people are thinking

170
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,400
And the Dutch pretty much have been thinking oh you know we're we're clear of this and that's what the government has been saying

171
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Yeah, we're we're clear when there's no economic problems no problem in the housing market

172
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,400
We rock we rule don't worry go back to bed nothing to see here

173
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Please continue to consume your television shows

174
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,400
And a while back earlier this year they announced that they would be starting something which is just

175
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Well, you know what it's about when you hear about the electronic child dossier

176
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,400
So the minute a child is born in the Netherlands

177
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
A dossier is open for them and that's not a vanilla folder. You know it's in the big database

178
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,400
And all kinds of information is entered into that database throughout the child's life

179
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,400
I don't know if there's actually a and hasn't started yet. It's going to start next year

180
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,400
And so now they're talking about you know how it's going to be used what's going to be in there and what turns out

181
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,400
One of the pieces of information which just proves that it's not about babies or young children

182
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Actually take children going into at least adolescents

183
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,400
There will be a description of pubic hair that's right an actual field in the database for the description of pubic hair

184
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:42,400
And the options I'm translating directly from Dutch here are two options dark

185
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Was it dark curled and hairy and a second one is adult hairy

186
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
I told this Patricia

187
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:08,400
You know because she's she's like well, you know, I don't mind CCTV cameras everywhere because they've tracked down hundreds of thousands of children who were abducted and I said yeah, but we know where's the limit

188
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Where does it stop if you have nothing to hide then I guess you won't mind entering your pubic hair information into the database

189
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:22,400
What's that necessary for I said you're going to question you know, you know, where's your where's your where do you draw the line

190
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,400
And then I showed her the the new x-ray machines where the basically looks like your naked

191
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:35,400
Which are being implemented and she's like well, I don't want that I said yeah, but I thought you had nothing to hide from the cameras. So what's your problem?

192
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Yeah, but that's messed up. I said thank you

193
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:47,400
And using these mainstream news articles is really what I want you to pay attention to when you're trying to wake someone up when you're trying to let them know that

194
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:53,400
That that something is going on in the reality that they have built up around themselves with help from

195
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Our government and our government controlled media

196
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:09,400
This is the kind of stuff when they read it in like the Wall Street Journal or or another mainstream publication they read these outrageous ludicrous things that are taking place that's our task that is our task for the coming year

197
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,400
As we give thanks on this day 2008

198
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:31,400
You can stand me up, let the gates of hell, but I won't let them know

199
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Stand my ground, won't be turned around

200
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,400
And I'll keep this world from dragging me down

201
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Stand my ground, and I won't let them know

202
00:22:53,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Hey baby, there's no easy way

203
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:12,400
I'm standing my ground, and I won't let them know

204
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Now I know what's right, I get just one line

205
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,400
And a world that keeps on pushing me around

206
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Stand my ground, and I won't let them know

207
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Hey baby, there's no easy way

208
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Hey baby, there's no easy way

209
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,400
And I won't let them know

210
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Stand my ground, and I won't let them know

211
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Hey baby, there's no easy way

212
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Hey baby, there's no easy way

213
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Time for any wall back down on the track

214
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,400
It's a super nice guy, Tom Petty, I've had the pleasure of meeting him a couple of times interviewing him

215
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
And I actually got into his head a little bit on the radio interview

216
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
I can't really do that in television, it's always so superficial and short

217
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Basically getting nothing out of him

218
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,400
But on the radio man, this guy is a true American rebel, fantastic Tom Petty

219
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Not with the heartbreakers there, I don't think I won't back down on daily source code 808

220
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,400
One more piece of medical news, which is kind of cultural that I want to pass along

221
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Indonesian law has been put in place, which includes a by-law

222
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
And this is something to look forward to

223
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Requiring, quote, sexually aggressive people living with HIV-AIDS to be implanted with microchips

224
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,400
So they can be tracked and punished

225
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:43,400
John Manning-Zung, who supports this bill, says authorities would be able to identify track and punish people

226
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,400
So the interesting thing here is that a microchip implanted would be

227
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Enable the government to identify track and punish

228
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
One simple microchip

229
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Identified track and punish people living with HIV-AIDS in the country's province of Papua

230
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Who intentionally spread the virus and they would be fined up to six months in jail with a $5,000 fine

231
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Now I do believe we need to do something about these types of illnesses

232
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,400
But this is going a little bit far, but of course it comes right in line with the Lisbon Treaty, which is

233
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Somehow going to be, well, in fact the European Union is already stating now that they're going to act under the

234
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
Lisbon principles, which is I really love that

235
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
No one as far as I know is opposing this

236
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
So under the financial principles

237
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,400
The banking sector is going to change around March April, the way money runs throughout the world

238
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,400
But in that Lisbon Treaty under the Human Rights portion, which you really have to find from four different documents

239
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,400
As protocols and all kinds of separate, they would just pull the whole document apart to make it difficult to understand

240
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Bless the Irish for either understanding or for knowing that this could not be good regardless and saying no in the referendum

241
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Even though as I said the principles of the Lisbon Treaty are now being utilized and put to use

242
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Right there under human rights, it said you have the right to freedom unless you are homeless

243
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Mentally insane

244
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Addicted to drugs or alcohol or if you have a communicable disease

245
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
It doesn't even specify which one then you can be incarcerated

246
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
So what's the next best thing?

247
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Ah, it's even better than that, just chip the people

248
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Chippem, chippem, chippem

249
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Alright, so now of course those of you who've been listening to this show know that I got to talk about the bank bailout

250
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Oh man

251
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Which by the way, I read is it a Webster's dictionary who proclaims the word of the year

252
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:57,400
I read in a Chris Perillo email news brief that he sends around that bailout has become the word of the year

253
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,400
And they added an additional $800 billion

254
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,400
Just two days ago to the bailout

255
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Which now I kind of lost track but I'm sure but I hope by now that you have heard that the total cost of the bailout is in the trillions

256
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,400
It was I think it was 7.4 trillion

257
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Before this additional $800 billion

258
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Now I just want, it's so hard to put this all into perspective

259
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,400
But let me give it a shot first of all

260
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
This money is

261
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Money that is guaranteed by the United States so even though the federal reserve is handing it out

262
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,400
And lending it out in some cases, in other cases buying

263
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Assets pieces of paper that guarantee some other pieces of paper that probably have no value

264
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
And the way they do this is they basically print it now

265
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,400
You don't it's not actually a printing press that is rolling

266
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:13,400
There's a spreadsheet and in the spreadsheet they say okay, we're going to add another two trillion dollars and we put it over on the

267
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,400
On the AIG side or the city bank side or whatever they need to

268
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400
And because it's all just numbers there's no money changing hands

269
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:31,400
This is the this way you got to kind of get your head around is that this is just trading numbers is a finite number that we can go to and they're just making that number bigger every single day

270
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,400
Which has to be

271
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Backed by money one way or the other

272
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,400
And that means that it will be paid for in taxes

273
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,400
It has to be or it has to be borrowed from another country

274
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:57,400
And also it's not like you know if we borrow money from China from a sovereign wealth fund that some

275
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Guy turns up with a huge check you know like one of those lottery winner checks. Yeah, it's just like a little all right

276
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Here's a little note in the database the IMF tracks it the bank of international settlements track all that it's a system. It's a network. It's a computer network

277
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Let me see if I can put this into a perspective for you how this is bad for us

278
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
So let's say

279
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
We'll equate

280
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,400
A dollar to a guitar pick

281
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:37,400
You've been to a show you've been to a concert and the guitarist you might have 15 or 20 guitar picks stuck to his Mike stand and then

282
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Some of these guys are really cool, you know, a little hand motion they flip it out into the audience and people love those and they're usually special autograph model

283
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:53,400
You know, it'll say whoever's a guitar pick it is and of course if you get an autograph and it might have a little bit more value

284
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,400
But let's say because I have a guy I won from geyser butler who was a base player for for Aussie

285
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Which he gave me in Russia

286
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Now let's say that's that's worth some money. You know, that's like worth a buck maybe if I went to some

287
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Swap meat

288
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
If it was the only one in existence

289
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
The only guitar pick

290
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,400
And let's face a guitar pick has no value really is a piece of plastic

291
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,400
He threw it in the audience at the at the show

292
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
I grabbed it

293
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,400
And it was the only one he ever threw into the audience it could be worth a couple thousand dollars

294
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,400
But if he flips ten of those at every single show then that value is going to come down to probably about a buck or maybe 50 cents

295
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,400
Do you see the analogy because there's more other around it's not that special anymore that is how

296
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Supply and demand works that is just something basic and that's when you know when you hear people on television talking about all the free markers

297
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:03,400
Well, yeah, that's what should be taking place, but of course there's a little something extra special in the middle called the federal reserve

298
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
For other

299
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,400
Globe dwellers and Europe you'd call that the European Central Bank it would be the Bank of England

300
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,400
But particularly the federal reserve is is interesting because it is not a part of the US government

301
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:23,400
The reason why they name it federal is great marketing exercise just like federal express also not owned by the government

302
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:30,400
So they have since this is going to be going on since 1913 when the federal reserve act was put into place

303
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:37,400
They have had the right to print the money what's interesting about this is that they don't have to tell us what they're doing with it

304
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:48,400
They do not Bloomberg news agency has been trying to understand where all these trillions of dollars have been going to and what what has been purchased with it and from home and

305
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Bernanke says you're business we're not to tell you go look at the federal reserve act of 1913 we own your ass and we own the money now when you can basically

306
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Make more guitar picks or because it's not even something you can hold in your hand

307
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Forget about the paper dollars, you know, I'm talking about the money in the spreadsheets you can also take away

308
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,400
This gives them the power to control interest rates

309
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:25,400
Okay, and the interest rate is what determines a lot of things what your house is going to cost what your car you know out of can out of pocket cash

310
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:35,400
We your car is going to cost how much money you'll make what your taxes will be like it is a complete manipulation of the system and you can bet your

311
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Bottom worthless piece of printed dollar paper

312
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:51,400
That whenever they manipulate it's for their own good because the members and although not even published in its entirety and unknown as far as as far as my research has taken me

313
00:33:51,400 --> 00:34:00,400
We don't even really know who owns or who the member banks are at the Federal Reserve. Yes, some of them are out there and there's some there's some stuff on the website, but I

314
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Would say a lot of the banks that are doing quite well or have now turned into banks

315
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
I'm looking at you Goldman Sachs

316
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:18,400
And isn't that interesting and doesn't it make sense that all these guys can be traced back to Goldman Sachs the Federal Reserve the Fed of New York

317
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:26,400
And the Treasury Department they've been at this game a long long time and now it's blowing up in their face and

318
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:38,400
What they're doing is they're just handing out money and I love hearing oh, well, you know, it really does it sounds shitty for me to have to say if we hadn't given all this money away it would be a lot lot worse

319
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,400
I always why is there no journalist saying excuse me could you please tell me how how much worse?

320
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,400
You know, are we talking about no food riots?

321
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
Are we talking about martial law?

322
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:57,400
How much worse could it get we've got millions of people who are losing their jobs people who are getting kicked out of the homes

323
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,400
How much excuse me and Mr. Paulson Mr. Secretary Hank I have a question how much worse can it get?

324
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:12,400
He's not going to answer that because that is exactly the truth and he and his buddies are all getting out with our money

325
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:21,400
So let me give you another little statistic in the past eight years the Bush administration has built up a debt a national debt in the US

326
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,400
It was around nine trillion dollars

327
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:38,400
So yeah, it took him about a trillion dollars a year and of course that's all money that we borrowed from from other countries and spent it on killing people and in defense defending as well

328
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
but on a lot of war stuff

329
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:49,400
And within the span of a couple months that number is about to double to double

330
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Something that took eight years to build up this huge debt we're doubling it now and it will take many many many years to pay off

331
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:05,400
We don't even know if we'll get any of those loans back and then and none of these guys give a shit because they've got their money

332
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,400
They've got their bonuses, they've got their homes in Paraguay

333
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Where George Bush has a nice compound

334
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,400
And they do not love you your government does not love you

335
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Hillary Clinton proposed a universal health care

336
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,400
System which I have to be very honest, I never looked into it

337
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,400
I was quite asleep happily in my matrix at the time

338
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,400
But I did go back and look at the numbers and see what it would have cost

339
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,400
At the times he was talking about a hundred and ten billion dollars

340
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,400
A hundred and ten billion to basically fix health care

341
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,400
So let's say in today's dollars, I'll just make it crazy because what you heard about with the pharmaceutical companies are doing

342
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,400
So maybe it would have to be five hundred billion and it could have been fixed five hundred billion dollars

343
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,400
Now look at all the trillions that are being spent on the banking industry

344
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Your government doesn't love you, they don't want you to be healthy

345
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,400
They hate you all of them

346
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Look at what you could have fixed education

347
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:27,400
So much could have been done with this money or just a fraction of the money a little teeny tiny crumb of this money could have done so much good

348
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Excuse me, that's just I'm literally getting nauseous when I think about it

349
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Let's move on beyond the subprime bubble the other seven deadly bubbles

350
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:49,400
This is from Silicon Valley watcher. Oh, yeah, this is I'm not going to go through all of this, but if you really want to see how how screwed America is certainly

351
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,400
And why it is inevitable that the dollar will collapse

352
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:05,400
It's just going to happen and it could be it could happen in March or April when the European Union or the rest of the G20 comes back to the table and says America, are you in or not?

353
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,400
And I think damned if we do damned if we don't the new reserve money will not be the dollar

354
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
It'll be something else

355
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Maybe it'll be something called like the greeney

356
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,400
For some kind of carbon carbon thing

357
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,400
But definitely look at that link it's in the show notes daily source code dot com and of course cross posted it at curry dot com

358
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:38,400
Yeah, and just to show you how how much they they hate you and and love themselves

359
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:49,400
That is a great a great article about city group and AIG still spending hundreds of millions of dollars and sports team sponsorships

360
00:38:50,400 --> 00:39:02,400
You know, now I must say that if you're really taking the bailout at face value and saying, okay, you know, these companies need to operate and otherwise, you know, blah, blah, if you're really by into it

361
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,400
Then it makes sense that you know, it's it's partially a marketing exercise. I don't know if you need hundreds of millions, but

362
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,400
You know, a lot of commercial companies keep sports going

363
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,400
So I will put some defense on that side

364
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,400
But at the end of the day, I mean, holy moly

365
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Let me see, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're like this little voicemail call here just to prove that

366
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Hey, where'd it go? Here we go. Just to prove that your bank really does hate you. Hey Adam, this is Roy from Delft and the other ones

367
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:45,400
I'm listening to the DSC and no agenda now for about a year and a half or so and I find that sometimes you're a little out there

368
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:54,400
It was quite entertaining. Oh, I think I sort of got hooked because the first show I ever listened to was a food bar Friday and the mix of tech talk and music hooked me good

369
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Anyway, I wanted to share this story with you. I moved here from Chicago about four years ago and when I did I left my old bank account open

370
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,400
It was the first checking count. I ever opened when I was 16 at a small local bank in the suburbs of Chicago

371
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:18,400
But since then, it had been swallowed up and merged and merged and merged and now the account is was with a very large national bank and to avoid all the handling and telephone

372
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:27,000
I had changed into an internet only account somewhere along the way. Oh, yeah, they love that man. There's these internet only banks. Oh, yeah

373
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:37,400
I just can't wait for to be linked to my new national ID card here in the United Kingdom signalling out foreigners. I still had some bills to settle and I thought

374
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:45,400
It would also be handy to keep the visa debit card open for when I travel back to the states. That's actually a very good idea

375
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:54,400
If you are in another country and it's very difficult these days by the way to open up a bank account in another country because you have to prove residency now

376
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,400
If you have the opportunity and you can find a way to do it not a bad idea

377
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:06,400
It's this is that the a lot of people ask me about my investment strategies or what I do with my money and I'll just repeat it. It's in physical gold

378
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
not here

379
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:18,400
Don't come to the house. You'll be disappointed as well as in currencies and I have multiple currencies and multiple banks and multiple countries

380
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,400
So and credit cards for all or debit cards, which I prefer for each of them

381
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,400
And it you'll find it a very

382
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
handy

383
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,400
With the fluctuation and I if you look at the the pound it was two dollars to the pound now. It's one fifty

384
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,400
the euro now around one twenty five

385
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,400
That was close to one fifty

386
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:51,400
And you start making decisions based upon where you purchase and what kind of monetary union unit you're going to go into buy

387
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,400
And it's a very very good idea in general

388
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,400
It's a very good idea

389
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Unfortunately, of course everything you do is tracked and traced and put into your into your database right next to your

390
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,400
Pupicare details

391
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,400
We used it for years without incident or trouble until this summer

392
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,400
We took a trip back to Chicago in September at the beginning of the summer when we were planning the trip

393
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,400
I checked the balance on that account just so I knew what I would have in there

394
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,400
Planning proceeded and we booked a trip on everything

395
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,400
We had to get an American passport and to the states for my eight month old daughter

396
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
Even though she had her own individual Dutch passport

397
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:38,400
But that's a whole other story. Oh, yeah, I'd love to hear about that one. Yeah, this is a US immigration. Oh, please please

398
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,400
Stop already. I know it sucks

399
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
Anyway

400
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,400
About a month before leaving we decided to order some things online using the visa capabilities of the debit card

401
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,400
And we wanted it delivered to where we were going to be staying

402
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,400
We had about eighty dollars on the account the last time I checked so we placed an order to a link seventy four dollars

403
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,400
No problem, right?

404
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:07,400
But the skeptic in me decided to check the account balance so I was shocked to find out that I was twelve dollars in the whole

405
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:16,400
The activity on the account showed nothing except for the bank itself taking six dollars a month for the last three months as an inactivity fee

406
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,400
I had this thing exactly the same thing happened to me. I had a US bank account bank of America

407
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,400
Yeah, exactly we know what happened to them

408
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,400
And it was like I put 10 grand into the account and it was it was an online account

409
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,400
I did set it up in the bank itself though in the physical location

410
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:49,400
And what happens is you know, so you put it in and then they take like some bullshit fee then it becomes nine thousand nine hundred ninety five

411
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,400
And I noticed that every month they were deducting twenty bucks because I didn't have the minimum ten thousand dollar level

412
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Well, yeah

413
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Oh, no there's scum absolute scum stealing thieving cock suckers

414
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,400
They were literally stealing six dollars a month from me for not using my account

415
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,400
So I called customer service right away because I didn't want to end up with overdraft penalties

416
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,400
Which I think also started about fifty dollars and then twenty dollars a day until it's wrecked

417
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,400
I hate this oh man, let me just say you get it's a long comment to let me listen a little bit near you

418
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
And you would be sent a notice by mail again

419
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,400
I asked I pointed out the old yeah, we sent it by by post but but it's an internet account

420
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,400
Yeah, I know that but they weren't at all surprised and they didn't try to talk me out of it. Oh, when you close the account

421
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,400
So I guess basically the lesson from all this is that everybody should know that if they have money in the bank on an account

422
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:53,400
Does it mean if they aware that if they don't use the account then the bank itself will just start stealing their money

423
00:44:53,400 --> 00:45:00,400
Yep, which I think is totally wrong and bogus, but it's not much I think I can do about it as an individual

424
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,400
Anyways, Adam thinks for all the great shows and I'm going to keep listening

425
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,400
They work for us

426
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,400
No, they don't they should be but they're not anymore

427
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,400
So I've kind of tried to explain the central banking problem. This is why I was so incredibly happy

428
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:28,400
And it's ramped throughout the whole banking industry by the way, and you probably have now figured out that when the banks don't lend money

429
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,400
Then everything kind of grinds to a halt

430
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:41,400
That's why you see big big box companies going out of business Woolworths now in receivership here in the United Kingdom

431
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:49,400
And that's because they were used to using or basically living beyond their means everyone has been living beyond their means

432
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,400
Some to an extreme based upon debt

433
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:01,400
And I think just and this is very encouraging to me. It feels like we are now and this is what they call by the way

434
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,400
Deflation we've gotten smart

435
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,400
And we're just staying away from the stuff we don't need anymore

436
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,400
That's why you hear the government say hey, please go out and shop

437
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,400
We're going to give you some money to shop. We're lowering the value add attacks the sales tax

438
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,400
Go out and shop because they need money to be flowing

439
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,400
And probably the best thing we can do, although it will accelerate the problems that are coming

440
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,400
We have to take the pain anyway, so we might as well keep the money in our pocket

441
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:42,400
Or buy things that have actual value if possible, home, land, anything that really is physical

442
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,400
And I'm not talking to a piece of winky, blinky plastic with headphones

443
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,400
Like real stuff

444
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,400
Which actually excludes a lot of things, not to think about it

445
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,400
But yeah, gold, gold and silver, you might as well do it

446
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,400
If you're not going to spend it, put it into something that will retain some form of value

447
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,400
That's what I'm doing at least

448
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,400
But the beauty is that we're all kind of thinking and working together in this

449
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,400
In a strange kind of way

450
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
And the government hates this

451
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,400
And the bankers really really hate it

452
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,400
They do not want you to stop spending

453
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:35,400
So that's why I was so happy that this weekend in 38 or 39 cities across the US

454
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,400
They had the end the fed day to end the federal reserve

455
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,400
Now this is something that we could have been talking about a year ago or two years ago

456
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,400
Or geez, almost 100 years ago, if you look at it

457
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,400
And many presidents throughout the American history have gotten rid of central banks

458
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,400
And have paid the price for it, many of them with their lives

459
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,400
Lincoln

460
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,400
Jefferson

461
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,400
Kennedy

462
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:11,400
Because they uncovered the true evil ways of the central banks and the owners of the central banks being the true elite

463
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,400
The true owners of the earth

464
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,400
So I really want you know we couldn't have talked about this because there was no bank bailout

465
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,400
There were no trillions of dollars being spent on bullshit and that was not being explained

466
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,400
And people are going to get pissed off at this now

467
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,400
So the idea of end the fed is good

468
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,400
It's good and we've got to propagate this and let people do their own research

469
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,400
But end the fed it's a great slogan

470
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,400
I like it, it doesn't work for the European Central Bank

471
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:44,400
So we have to figure out how we're going to work in Europe and the Bank of England and other central banks

472
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,400
Cut the central bank, annihilate the central bank

473
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,400
And send the central bank to hell

474
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,400
We've got to come over with a couple of slogans and the fed is a really good one

475
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:06,400
And it's not that hard for people to understand and it's certainly not hard for them to channel their anger, frustration and other forms of energy

476
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,400
Because they're seeing that we're being robbed

477
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:18,400
And it's pretty much, I think now it's almost like a mainstream type of conversation that can be had about what's happening in banking

478
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,400
I don't entirely understand it

479
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,400
Russian economist certainly understands it

480
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,400
Professor Igor Panarin, if you have not read this

481
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,400
This was listed on many different sites this past week, this one I'm actually getting

482
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,400
Excuse me, from the drug report

483
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,400
And this Russian economist

484
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,400
Economist or analyst

485
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:55,400
Well, he basically lays it out real simple the dollar is not secured by anything the country's foreign debt has grown like an avalanche

486
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,400
Even though in the early 1980s there was no debt by 1998 when I first made my prediction

487
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:06,400
It had exceeded two trillion now it's more like 11 trillion so he's he's counting the he's already behind on this

488
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:13,400
Of course this was November 25th three days ago. Yeah, it wasn't you now it's more like I think probably close to the 15 trillion

489
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,400
Quote this is a pyramid that can only collapse now what he's predicting

490
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,400
That the US will break up into separate parts

491
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:30,400
He's predicting the Pacific coast with its growing Chinese population the south with its Hispanics

492
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,400
Texas which will be his own of course Texas will be its own

493
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,400
Its own country

494
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:45,400
Where independence movements are on the rise as he writes and the Atlantic coast with its distinct and separate mentality

495
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:52,400
Five of the poorer central states where their large native American populations and then of course there's northern states

496
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,400
Where we've got a lot of influence from from Canada

497
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,400
You know what that is not unthinkable

498
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:06,400
Because the states really is in a way it's like Europe you know the EU is the United States of Europe

499
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:14,400
And the USA United States of America the you know they call them member states here so you could say Britain is

500
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,400
Or Britain be what could we equate that to

501
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,400
There probably the East Coast I'd say

502
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,400
It could happen

503
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,400
It really really could if the shit comes if the shit starts to hit the fan particularly

504
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,400
When it comes to

505
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,400
When it comes to the dollar being devalued or eliminated or replaced overnight

506
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,400
You're going to see a lot of problems and look at what's happening in Iceland

507
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,400
The people are now starting to revolt it's a very very small country

508
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,400
And it was like 300,000 people live there most of them in Rikivik

509
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,400
They're now storming the police station

510
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
You know they want the government fired

511
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,400
And guess what they get pepper sprayed of course

512
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,400
This is not to tut the horn, but just so you know that I'm not crazy

513
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,400
This is from the BBC and whenever you know we've talked about something

514
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,400
And we've had our opinions and I've had a strong opinion right or wrong whenever

515
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,400
More news comes out about it

516
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,400
I really do want to put that in front of you a former Georgian ambassador

517
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,400
Has caused an uproar in Georgia this obviously being about Georgia and South of Serbian

518
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,400
Atlanta Georgia and he's saying erosy hit Marsh Vili

519
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,400
He says look Georgia started that whole thing

520
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:44,400
He said Russia was ready, but the Georgian leadership started the military action first

521
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,400
There you go

522
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,400
By Chuck us Vili's own guys say in that

523
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,400
Up in Canada

524
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,400
And this is why I'm so worried when I when I compare to

525
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,400
To Iceland Canada's two largest banks Monday

526
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,400
Move to raise fresh capital to shore up their reserves

527
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,400
As the worst financial crisis since the depression continued to weaken the country's banking system

528
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,400
This is from the financial post

529
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,400
And the problem is that their central bank and this is why I say it's really falling apart at the seams

530
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,400
The Royal Bank of Canada

531
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,400
Says we basically don't have the money

532
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,400
We can't lend these banks the money

533
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,400
So they only have a couple options follow the the American model of just printing it causing inflation

534
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,400
Or who knows

535
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,400
Britain going bankrupt you think it's not possible

536
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,400
Absolutely when you read this fantastic piece from

537
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,400
It was at Ambrose Evans Pritchard

538
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,400
Which is in the show notes it's

539
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,400
Ambrose writes for the telegraph

540
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,400
Let me just see if I can get a highlight here

541
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,400
But he really walks down

542
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,400
All of you know because the numbers are much smaller here

543
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:06,400
So when you look at the deficit of 118 billion pounds or about 170 billion

544
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,400
Dollars that's the entire

545
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,400
deficit of the United Kingdom, but he really breaks down all these numbers and the credit default swaps

546
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,400
And he's seeing that the country is essentially bankrupt

547
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,400
And he's saying it and he's breaking it down so beautifully

548
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,400
And that is of course why the United Kingdom announced a 40 actually it'll be more be more like

549
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,400
55 to 60% tax rate income tax on those making over 100

550
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,400
They say 150, but I think the actual number will be about 100,000 pounds a year

551
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:47,400
Upper middle class okay, if that's not it's rich, but it's in the United Kingdom that will be considered upper middle class or at least it was considered that

552
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:55,400
And I don't think people will be able to sustain it now the best article of the week goes to Robert Kiel Sochi

553
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,400
I guess he has a column on Yahoo, is it Yahoo?

554
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,400
Hold on a second

555
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,400
Sorry, I really

556
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,400
I don't have any tissues up here so I close the mic for that disgusting noise

557
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:24,400
Robert writes how the financial crisis was built into the system and I love this article this is probably the simplest explanation

558
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:32,400
Of what is happening how the central banks are bringing us down and he is going one step further. He's saying they plan this

559
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:40,400
And he starts off by 1910 seven men held a secret meeting on Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia that would be Atlanta, Georgia

560
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,400
It's estimated that these seven men represented one sixth of the world's wealth

561
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:54,400
Six Americans representing JP Morgan John D. Rockefeller in the US government and one was a European representing the Roth child in the war burgs

562
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,400
If you've been listening to this show, these names are not foreign to you

563
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,400
And if you know anything about banking these names are not foreign to you

564
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:12,400
And then of course 1913 the US Federal Reserve bank was created as a direct result of that secret meeting. He goes all the way through he actually equates a lot of what's happening

565
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:19,400
In some Bobway or what has been happening to what can happen in the United States in Britain in Europe anywhere in the world

566
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:29,400
And of course he doesn't actually say what we can do about it because we may be and we're probably too late really to stop the downfall of currencies

567
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:37,400
But we certainly can rise in opposition of the central banks if you want to pass something on to anybody if you want them to know

568
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:46,400
How this central banking is killing us and why it should be stopped and the Fed annihilate the central banks pass them that link

569
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:57,400
It's Robert Kiyosaki again in the show notes a daily source code dot com cross posted at curry dot com and I just want to say a lot of people tell me all the Roth child

570
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:04,400
You know I don't know where you're getting your information from you know they they don't you know their banking isn't that you get listen

571
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,400
Even though I hate saying that listen look listen

572
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,400
Please pay attention is what I mean

573
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,400
The Roth child's huge

574
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:21,400
If you ever remember there was a huge ISP in an service provider called world online

575
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,400
It was set up in the Netherlands at a huge public offering which failed a lot of people lost money big lawsuits

576
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:34,400
I think it was part of the beginning of the down to the bursting of the dot com bubble that particular IPO

577
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,400
But I knew Nina Brink the CEO quite well

578
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:45,400
From a number of almost business dealings thank goodness and ever actually did any real business with her because she is truly an evil person

579
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:51,400
But I remember her talking about because she would talk a lot is quite animated when she spoke

580
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,400
As she would talk about

581
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:01,400
Oh, yeah, this deal and I can get it these people and and you know I can this is where the Roth child and we can do business with the Roth child

582
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,400
And I can remember

583
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:08,400
She almost looked like she was horny when she said that she had opportunity to work with the Roth child

584
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:14,400
And she is anyone who knows her and the Dutch chuckle heads and the former arrowheads will agree with me as she's all about money

585
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,400
And she I mean she literally would get moist. I could tell smell

586
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,400
She got moist from just the idea

587
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,400
Of the Roth child's because they aren't the true elite and owners of the globe

588
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:31,400
And of course the other way to get rid of these guys outside of central banking is to get rid of the use of oil

589
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:37,400
Really any type of centralized energy and I know it's out there will be looking at a couple of links later on in the show. Of course

590
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:45,400
It's out there something where you can like rub your hands in a circular motion spread some salt water on it all the sudden you got like power

591
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,400
And we're going to figure that out

592
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,400
More study of Tesla is necessary for that

593
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:56,400
Let me see some I just some things you can look at over over the weekend

594
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,400
This is from the august review dot com Obama merely a fob for the global elite

595
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,400
Well, I think that should be pretty clear by now that look at the people he's bringing into his administration

596
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:16,400
Particularly on the finance side. Oh, by the way Robert Gates defences Secretary East and he keep the same guys in there. Why not? Hey, that's changed for you

597
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,400
Yesterday I was watching the tonight show

598
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:28,000
Jay Leno had I forget her name. She has a talk show on the e-network. She's a comedian's kind of funny

599
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:34,400
Actually, I think she was funny on Jay then she is on her show. I forget the name and she said something about Obama

600
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,400
And you know about how happy she was and it was dead silent

601
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:44,400
Where's a couple of weeks ago you would have had people erupting in cheers. Yeah, change just weekend

602
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,200
It's like, you know, it was like the Super Bowl and now it's over. No one gives a shit

603
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,400
No one cares everyone's disillusioned already and those who aren't and that that was just an audience vibe

604
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,400
You know, you can get an audience to do almost anything. It's so easy to get them to cheer

605
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,400
But when she took a very open

606
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:08,900
Easy route to get the audience riled up. It was dead silent pay attention. You'll see the same thing on the John Stewart show

607
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:14,900
You'll see it no longer is it Obama changed. Yeah, the audience goes crazy. Nope

608
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:24,900
Because they're feeling it. They know what they're living in duality the the the veil of the matrix is starting to be lifted bit by bit. It's exactly the same people coming from the same

609
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:29,900
Environments by the way Chicago or man the gangster heaven

610
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,900
Lots of Chicago influence in the in the Obama administration

611
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,900
But particularly on the finance side. Oh, man summers and

612
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,900
The new treasury secretary

613
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,900
Timothy Geitner

614
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,900
The same guys it's for their from

615
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:57,900
The federal reserve the treasury Goldman Sachs trilateral commission a council on foreign relations

616
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,900
It's all the same thing. They're not going to change anything. There is no change

617
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,900
And you should be pretty damn pissed off about if you voted for Obama

618
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:11,900
Here's the one that scares me the most this is from the Denver post and this is

619
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:21,900
Where I think unfortunately were headed in fact this article starts off with with the line one one more palpable sign of a desperate economy

620
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,900
Check this out

621
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,900
The Miller's the Miller family has a farm

622
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:35,900
And as the I'm just on jumping around because I want to save the payoff the big punch line

623
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:44,900
As this prolonged Indian summer continued the Miller's had decided to give away produce because so much was left over at the end of their annual fall festival

624
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,900
And of course when the deep freeze comes it'll kill it off so they had to give this food away

625
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:55,900
They expected you know over the course of a couple days maybe five to ten thousand people would show up

626
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:09,900
What happened is 40,000 people came to get free potatoes carrots leaks car snaked around corn fields parallel parked along Route 66

627
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:15,900
And one nineteen all for free food 40,000 people

628
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,900
Food banks

629
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:26,900
Now dishes out exactly twice what they did this time last year and they're out there's no food left

630
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:34,900
And I'm not talking about the stuff you buy in the supermarket that's not actual food God buy some real food God buy some carrots

631
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,900
See what they cost by the way

632
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,900
Yeah, we're going to have to get to the protest we're going it's going to have to happen pretty soon

633
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:47,900
As I said they're right you pick it's taking place in Thailand

634
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:54,900
I put a link in the show notes as well about the Bangkok airport protesters are shooting and being shot at at the airport

635
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,900
They want this you know they got they've had a coup several coups take place

636
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,900
They want this government out

637
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:06,900
Voting apparently doesn't work anymore, so now they're just taking over the infrastructure

638
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,900
This is where we're all headed eventually if we don't stop it in some other way

639
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:19,900
And we can start by ending the Federal Reserve, annihilating the central banks and do not be afraid to resist

640
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,900
And it's all you'll be just a lie

641
01:03:46,900 --> 01:04:16,900
They tell us what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's

642
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:46,900
up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, but what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up

643
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:51,900
Break for yourself, you're my friend signer

644
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:56,900
You're always where you say, you're my love, right now you're here

645
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:01,900
I'm your friend, you're my friend, you're my friend, right now you're my friend

646
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:06,900
You're my friend, you're my friend, right now you're my love

647
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:21,900
Break for yourself, you're my friend, okay now you're my love, right now you're my love

648
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:37,900
Break for yourself, you're my friend, you're my love, right now you're my love, right now you're my love

649
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:12,900
You're just going to end for fun and the resistance of Chuckle 8-0.

650
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:19,900
And that resistance, Charnal Heds, that's us.

651
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,900
Yeah, so many people asked me.

652
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,900
Adam, what are we going to do?

653
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:25,900
I hear you.

654
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,900
What are we going to do?

655
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:28,900
Easy.

656
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:29,900
All that you have to do.

657
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:32,900
And those who want to do more will stand up all by themselves.

658
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,900
All you have to do is just tell more people about what's really going on.

659
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:36,900
Help them cut through the matrix.

660
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,900
See what's happening.

661
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:39,900
Turn them on to this show.

662
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:40,900
There are other programs.

663
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,900
In fact, there is a show called cutting through the matrix.

664
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,900
I think I haven't listened to it, but someone sent me a link.

665
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,900
That's why that stuck on my head.

666
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,900
If you want to hear great guess, I don't agree with everything he says.

667
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:54,900
The extent he takes it to, although extremely interesting, the Alex Jones show.

668
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,900
I love listening to the guests that are on his show.

669
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,900
He has just phenomenal booker.

670
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:00,900
Not hooker.

671
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:01,900
Booker.

672
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,900
Who gets great guests on his show.

673
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:05,900
Man, do I love that?

674
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:09,900
And they corroborate everything we're talking about.

675
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,900
Turn someone on to one of these shows.

676
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:12,900
Send them to drop.io.

677
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,900
Let them just look at these articles.

678
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,900
It's not like cookie internet stuff.

679
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,900
It's BBC, Wall Street Journal, New York Times.

680
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:20,900
You can even wired magazine.

681
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:25,900
You can't call a cookie.

682
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:29,900
So that's the resistance that will come from us.

683
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,900
But it'll come from in many other forms.

684
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,900
I talked earlier about systems administrators.

685
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,900
True heroes of the internet, unsung heroes I might add.

686
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:42,900
When you're talking border gateway protocol and you're dealing with routing issues.

687
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,900
Oh, man.

688
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:49,900
There's so much crap that goes on on the big iron side, the pipe side.

689
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,900
Just to get stuff flowing to keep it working.

690
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:52,900
There's a lot.

691
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,900
And it's a community of people.

692
01:07:55,900 --> 01:08:00,900
And I think that most of them are really on our side.

693
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:05,900
And we'll help us route around any kind of crap that governments try to push on us.

694
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:15,900
There's just too much networked in too many ways and too many holes and ports and pipes and protocols to not be able to continue to communicate.

695
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:16,900
But we're going to lose a lot of people.

696
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:22,900
A lot of people are going to fall off the edge of the earth because they will not know that there is a real internet.

697
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:27,900
And then there's the fake government sponsored internet, which will be taken over pretty soon.

698
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:33,900
But I wanted to, I mentioned this in reference to what's happening in Australia.

699
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:40,900
And now you know that the government is talking about censoring the internet at the ISP level.

700
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:45,900
And now there's a backlash that's, and this is really funny.

701
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:56,900
A backlash that is coming because in the Australian daily telegraph, they, they talked about some filters that were set up.

702
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:01,900
Where, and these are types of words that got, that got filtered out.

703
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:06,900
Sialis, which, you know, whether you think it's good or bad.

704
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:13,900
I mean, it says nothing to do with pornography, other than that, you might use it to make some pornography.

705
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:35,900
Communication's minister Helen Cunan is quoted in the article saying that her own department's filter would not allow her to order strawberry muffins online because of the word muff.

706
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:38,900
Stuff at Martha's muffin.

707
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:42,900
They have another, he has a good one.

708
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:51,900
The home office consultation in the United Kingdom were surprised to find some submissions automatically rejected by a filtering system set up in one part of that department.

709
01:09:51,900 --> 01:10:03,900
The consultation was on the subject of extreme pornography and the filter took exception to receiving emails with the word pornography in the title.

710
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,900
Idiots.

711
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:14,900
This is what gives me, it's make me feel good because we're so far ahead of these black jobs and particularly the cis admins will find plenty of ways to get around it.

712
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:19,900
This is our true salvation. Again, I'm so happy that we have the internet. Oh, man.

713
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:24,900
Government loses at least one PC a week. Another article from the BBC.

714
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:31,900
That, of course, will be soon be computers containing information about your pubic hair.

715
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:41,900
There's an, I'm just rushing through some of this stuff because I don't want to go through all of them. You got to do some of your own work and emphasize a lot of this is on the drop British broadband.

716
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:54,900
I think this is pretty much a setup. You'll see that broadband actually in a pretty sorry state here in the UK. I'm expecting the government to come up with just internet to same thing.

717
01:10:54,900 --> 01:11:06,900
Although I don't know if my pubic hair will have to be listed. All other types of biometric identification information will be put on my new ID card. The scheme.

718
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,900
Will be launched.

719
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:13,900
I guess the beginning of the year.

720
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:22,900
And it's, it's meant for me. Who knows. Maybe they put this all scheme together just for me.

721
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:37,900
People living in the United Kingdom who are workers from outside the European economic area, but are married to an EU national and therefore have a quote right to work in the European Union. That would be me.

722
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:44,900
They're being singled out as the first ones to have to have this ID card.

723
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:58,900
And it will contain, there we go. Document will feature the holder's name, date of birth, their visa status, right to work as well as a photograph fingerprint record and other biometric data.

724
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:05,900
That's an easy throw away isn't it? It's almost like with links to Al Qaeda with other biometric data.

725
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:10,900
I'm sure maybe some DNA.

726
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:18,900
And if I don't, I won't be led into the country. I can't travel essentially. I'll have to get that.

727
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:29,900
But of course, I was talking to a guy who was, you know, we're in the middle of this move and I was talking to a guy who came over to do some stuff, some like inspection stuff.

728
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:37,900
You know, it's like, you know, he said, no, how long have you been here? So we moved about four years ago. We really loved the United Kingdom. We, uh, we chose to come here. We always want to live here.

729
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:47,900
But I'm a little, on this point, it's not the word, but I'm surprised that I don't see that fighting British spirit. You know, where's the wirey pale stringy hair,

730
01:12:47,900 --> 01:13:00,900
uh, angry on the street, burning shit up, you know, remember the Maggie that's your days, you know, the punks. I was watching a channel for ITV, ITV, I think last night, but just before we went to bed or before we went to sleep, we were in bed.

731
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:14,900
It was about the clash, Joe Strummer. Oh, man. That's, you know, where's that revolution? And he said, uh, where'd he say?

732
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:27,900
Bohica. I said, Bohica. Yes, it Bohica. That's, uh, that's what's happened in the United Kingdom. Bohica. So what's that? Bend over. Here it comes again.

733
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,900
Hey, Adam, hi, doing. I'm good, man. I'm thankful.

734
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:45,900
It is. Hey, there's number one, four, nineer. And we're going to start right away with intro number one.

735
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:58,900
All right. Oh, I know the song. It's, oh, man, we played that. It's like a weekend weekend lover weekend. It comes a weekend. I don't remember young.

736
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:16,900
Number two. Uh, Uh, uh, Ehh. James inflame. Uh, I think was it's uh, living daylight. I think it's definitely uh, uh, with the James Bond theme. I think it's living day nice. And number three.

737
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:23,900
These people, he's got a fight for your right to part-chain, so I'm curious if I got

738
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:24,900
the first one right.

739
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:25,900
That's a little different.

740
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:26,900
And it's time for the answers.

741
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,900
Hit me.

742
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:32,900
And this is answer number one.

743
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,900
This is class action.

744
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:44,900
I've got to wait for the host for a long time.

745
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:50,900
We can.

746
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:51,900
We can.

747
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:56,900
Here comes.

748
01:14:56,900 --> 01:15:01,900
We can.

749
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:02,900
We can.

750
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:03,900
We can.

751
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:04,900
That's another number one.

752
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:05,900
Yeah.

753
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:06,900
Got one star.

754
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:07,900
And this is answer number two.

755
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:08,900
Aha.

756
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:09,900
Two stars.

757
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,900
Twenty-and-and-and-and-and-and.

758
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:13,900
They try it.

759
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,900
Where we go.

760
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:16,900
Awesome.

761
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,900
That's a show.

762
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:25,900
The new new day light.

763
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:26,900
The three stars.

764
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:44,000
Of the three

765
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,160
I turned one

766
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:50,460
Where are they?

767
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,820
They always turn.

768
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:55,000
I can't believe but she still says no.

769
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:02,000
You got to fight for your right.

770
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:11,000
You got to fight for your right.

771
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Fight for your right is answer number three.

772
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
It's gone.

773
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,000
This concludes hit this number 149.

774
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
So Adam.

775
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
How did you do?

776
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I got five stars out of possible six.

777
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I'm actually amazed.

778
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I got that first one right.

779
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
By the way, somewhere there's a recording of me doing that

780
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Eastern Voice on on stage with a band called Hello Weez.

781
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
We'll have to find that video.

782
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Alrighty.

783
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
The answer is the dish and any other hitest.

784
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
And also the iTunes link so you can buy the tricks.

785
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Featured on the hitest online.

786
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Now to be founded hitest.meepio.com.

787
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Thanks again for playing Adam.

788
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Come on.

789
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Thank you.

790
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Everyone else.

791
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Thank you for listening.

792
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Next week.

793
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Don't hit this.

794
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
So until then.

795
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Have fun.

796
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Take care.

797
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
And remember to try to think with your heart.

798
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Bye-bye.

799
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Bye-bye.

800
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Thank you.

801
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,000
And of course, I'm thankful for your contributions to the Charlie every week as well.

802
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
All right.

803
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
We're almost near in the end of this Thanksgiving extravaganza.

804
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
A video I definitely want you to see, which is not worth playing because the guy speaks,

805
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
and it's hard to understand and buckminster Fuller.

806
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I've never heard of him.

807
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
But he has this concept, which has just stuck in my mind.

808
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I don't want to dwell on it too much.

809
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:41,000
But he was saying until we elevate ourselves in our thinking,

810
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
to understanding that we are basically

811
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:53,000
hopeless, incredibly advanced beings of energy that are held down on this globe,

812
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
called the Earth by a force called gravity.

813
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
And that we don't actually ever go up or down.

814
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
We go out or in.

815
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I.E.

816
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
You go outwards from the planet.

817
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
No matter where you are.

818
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Or you can go through something or around something.

819
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
But you don't actually go up or down.

820
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
You go out or in.

821
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
In towards the center.

822
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Out.

823
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Towards whatever else is out there.

824
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Until you actually realize that the sun is not setting,

825
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
but that when you and this is something that I actually can do now,

826
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I can feel that I am on the earth.

827
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
And I'm held down by gravity.

828
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
And as I as the earth is moving.

829
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
And spinning around the sun.

830
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
That's why the sun goes away.

831
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
If you still feel that the sun is setting and going down,

832
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
then what Buckminster Fuller says is,

833
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
you essentially fail humanity's final exam.

834
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Very interesting.

835
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Extremely deep shit.

836
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Have a look at the video.

837
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
There's a couple of him on YouTube.

838
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I'm not very familiar with Buckminster Fuller,

839
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,000
but he's an old dude who's pretty fucking smart.

840
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Very interesting.

841
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Just as we kind of wind up with some cool news.

842
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
There's now something called the Truman Show Syndrome.

843
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Sufferers convinced they are actually on reality TV.

844
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I laugh, but only because I still can.

845
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,000
And I can understand how people would have that.

846
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Another Patriot standing up.

847
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Chester T. Kelly.

848
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
And the reason why I mentioned him is I really like his website.

849
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And I like how he's thinking.

850
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,000
He's up for independent congress and a general election,

851
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
December 6th.

852
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Where the hell is it?

853
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Chester T. Catfish Kelly.

854
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Where's he run?

855
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Oh man.

856
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Anyway, the website is both parties are screwing you.com.

857
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Hey, let's listen to what this guy has to say.

858
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Well, let me, yeah, this is a YouTube video here on a site.

859
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Let's see what Chester T. Catfish Kelly.

860
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Cool.

861
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Nice production.

862
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Oh, wait a minute. Are you not hearing this?

863
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
You may not be.

864
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Ah, shit.

865
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Why is that not working?

866
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Oh, man.

867
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I'm hearing it.

868
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
But you're not.

869
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Well, maybe if I.

870
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I want a second. Let me just make sure.

871
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
This is kind of irritating.

872
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Oh, man.

873
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I've just re-routed everything.

874
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Now it should work.

875
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Let me save.

876
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
It doesn't work.

877
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
We'll pass on it.

878
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Well, shiver me timbers.

879
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Oh, crap.

880
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Maybe it's the wrong.

881
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
No auxiliary out.

882
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Shit.

883
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
It's going to sound flower.

884
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Why isn't that just working?

885
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I don't get it.

886
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
If I do this, no.

887
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
All right, forget about it.

888
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Anyway, take a look at both parties or screwing you.com.

889
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
That definitely worth it.

890
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Something I'm going to talk about with John C. Dvorak.

891
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
You know, I really want to get into it.

892
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I tried last week, but it just didn't work about these.

893
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Somali and pirates.

894
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
The whole reason we call them pirates is bothering me.

895
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:37,000
And maybe these are just people who are pissed off that we've taken all the fish out of their waters.

896
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
And now we're taking their oil either away from them or around them or whatever.

897
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Maybe it's just a protest.

898
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,000
But whenever you call someone something like that, just because it's on the high seas.

899
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
They're called pirates.

900
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
You can get this idea.

901
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
All right, shiver me timbers.

902
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I don't know.

903
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I really don't know.

904
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
It doesn't sit well with me.

905
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:04,000
What does it extremely well with me is this next report from the New York Times.

906
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:10,000
This is about the changing of the guard of the presidency of the European Union.

907
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
A real chance here, a real chance.

908
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:20,000
So at the Czech Republic, I believe, is the next in line.

909
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I think.

910
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Maybe I'm wrong about that.

911
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I thought that.

912
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I'm just reading through this real quick here.

913
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Anyway.

914
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:41,000
The.

915
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Oh, man.

916
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
I'm trying to read this now and trying to bring it to you straight.

917
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
You have to look for yourself.

918
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
But anyway, this is the the president of the Czech Republic.

919
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
The president in class, he's a 67.

920
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
And he's causing a lot of shit in Europe.

921
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I thought.

922
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I thought.

923
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Yeah, here it is.

924
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:05,000
The Czech Republic is about to assume the rotating presidency of the European Union.

925
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
There you go.

926
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,000
So this guy will be.

927
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Like.

928
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
It's our cozy.

929
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I presume that's how it works.

930
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I think that's the way it works.

931
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:25,000
He has come out against the global warming scam.

932
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:31,000
He calls straight out the financial crisis as bullshit.

933
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
And theft.

934
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:39,000
He has branded Elgor an apostle of arrogance.

935
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,000
And has accused the European Union of acting like a communist state.

936
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I love this guy so far.

937
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Well, that'd be a hoot.

938
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
They'll have to kill him.

939
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
They'll just have to kill him.

940
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
They can.

941
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I'm telling it.

942
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
This is what happens.

943
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Keep your eye on the guy from the Czech Republic.

944
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And then for the arrowheads former listeners to the radio show in the Netherlands.

945
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Take a liquid Bloomberg news agency has to say about.

946
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
About what's happening with the financial crisis.

947
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
The Dutch government.

948
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
The Dutch queen from the House of Orange.

949
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
So one of the elite families of the energy elite.

950
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
They own a significant portion of royal Dutch shell.

951
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
And as far as I'm concerned.

952
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Incredibly evil.

953
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Bernard, who was passed on.

954
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Was the founder of the builder bird group.

955
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
So that should tell you enough about that.

956
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Even the queen in her recent.

957
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Public outings.

958
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Hey, everything's fine.

959
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Nothing to see here.

960
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Go back to watching television.

961
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
It's all fine.

962
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Well, the boom of the 80s has left the Dutch saddle.

963
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:52,000
With the highest level of mortgage debt in the entire euro region.

964
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
With the economy sliding into recession.

965
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And the Dutch have our mortgage to the Hilt 98% of GDP.

966
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
That's what the mortgage debt equals.

967
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:16,000
And most people have borrowed up to 4.5% of their annual income.

968
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:23,000
And a lot of them have 110 to 120% value of the property mortgages.

969
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,000
And trust me, they have put all of that money into their homes.

970
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
The Dutch homes are beautiful there.

971
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I mean, I'll say immaculate restored, modernized.

972
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Everyone has new kitchens.

973
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
New living rooms.

974
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Beautiful.

975
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
It was a complete banana.

976
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
And now a lot of these arms.

977
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
These adjustable rate mortgages are going to come do.

978
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
And the Netherlands has no industry at all.

979
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
If you look at the United Kingdom, which has very little industry.

980
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
But essentially 30%.

981
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
This was just in the financial times the other day.

982
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
30% of the United Kingdom directly or indirectly works for the government.

983
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
So this is going to be the same in Holland.

984
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
In the lowland, the low country.

985
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
The only thing they can do is be in the service sector and provide stuff to each other.

986
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
No one's making anything there anymore.

987
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:18,000
And I feel bad because it's going to hit really, really hard in the Netherlands.

988
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
It's going to be horrific.

989
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
I think the lay also be huge.

990
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:28,000
The burden, because they do have socialized medicine and social security and very good benefits.

991
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
For people who have no income.

992
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
But of course, it's a very an increasingly smaller size of the population.

993
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
It was going to have to pay for that.

994
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
And that will be provided for by partially taxes.

995
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:45,000
And of course, devaluation of the euro by printing more and pumping more money into the economy.

996
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
You know, more guitar picks.

997
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,000
And let me just end with thankfulness for all the people out there.

998
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,000
The cooks, the idiots, the tinfoil hatwares, the people who are ridiculed,

999
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
coming up with alternative ways to come up with energy.

1000
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Because if we can actually get rid of our dependence upon oil, fossil fuels to burn,

1001
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:11,000
made by huge industry, if we can figure out how with all of this energy around us were made of energy.

1002
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Certainly there's got to be a way to harness that and be able to create it easily at home for free or cheaply.

1003
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Why would we actually have to be on a grid?

1004
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Anyone who's working on that, I love you.

1005
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
And appreciate your work.

1006
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
And there's always a cup of coffee in a sandwich at the Curry,

1007
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Manor, Castle Cottage, or Future Terrace for you.

1008
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:38,000
And so I leave you with a beautiful article about the flow, the Viveis Hydropower System,

1009
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,000
making energy from slow currents on the CBED floor.

1010
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,000
This has been around for many, many, many, many years.

1011
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Let's not forget that this stuff is out there.

1012
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:55,000
But that there are ways beyond solar, beyond wind power there.

1013
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:01,000
There is more out there and that we definitely have to support all of the efforts.

1014
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Oops.

1015
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
There we go.

1016
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Come on.

1017
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
There we go.

1018
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
It's what I was looking for.

1019
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
We have to support all of the efforts that are ongoing.

1020
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Because that's how we create our true freedom and independence.

1021
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
When the true owners of the globe don't have control over,

1022
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:22,000
that would give us electricity, heat, transportation.

1023
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:28,000
This is from two of the, without a doubt, best living songwriters

1024
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
in the United Kingdom, the Gallagher Brothers.

1025
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Oasis.

1026
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I'm Charney Itzeroy.

1027
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Here's the sound.

1028
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:44,000
It reminds me of where we are.

1029
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Looking back at all the things we've done.

1030
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:59,000
We've got to keep on keeping on.

1031
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Out to sea.

1032
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:10,000
It's the only place I ever see.

1033
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Can give myself some peace of life.

1034
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:24,000
You know it's getting hard to fly.

1035
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:30,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1036
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Always you had behind the wall.

1037
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Because if I had to go, it reminds me of where you belong.

1038
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:04,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1039
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:15,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1040
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:25,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1041
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:35,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1042
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:42,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1043
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Because if I had to go, it reminds me of where you belong.

1044
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:04,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1045
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:10,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1046
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:16,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1047
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:22,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1048
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:29,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1049
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:35,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1050
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:44,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1051
01:31:52,000 --> 01:32:02,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1052
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:07,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1053
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:17,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1054
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:32,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1055
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:47,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1056
01:32:47,000 --> 01:33:00,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1057
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:10,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1058
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1059
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:30,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1060
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:43,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1061
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:53,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1062
01:33:53,000 --> 01:34:00,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1063
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:11,000
It reminds me of where you belong.

1064
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:20,000
It reminds me of where you belong.
