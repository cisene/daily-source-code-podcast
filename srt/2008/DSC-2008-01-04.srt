00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,840
to Dustin Hoffman to walk in with a contamination suit,

42
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,360
particularly when you hear that kind of stuff

43
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,440
on the radio, just a little bit trippy.

44
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,920
And man, I've been in and out of just drifting

45
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,640
in and out of consciousness for the past week

46
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,080
with my laptop by my side because what else can you do?

47
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,920
But just lane beds, sweat, be delirious,

48
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,200
and watch conspiracy theory videos.

49
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,280
It'll really put you into a spiral.

50
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,520
Yeah, I got some of that, too.

51
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,880
So where I picked this up is actually

52
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,600
was a very happy occasion on, let's see,

53
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,320
right after Christmas, the 28th, Friday the 28th.

54
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,080
Oh, I take off my bathroom a little bit here.

55
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,680
I'm getting warm.

56
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,040
Do you like the wife, Peter?

57
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,800
Thank you.

58
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,640
We, the three of us went over to

59
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,080
with a Netherlands to Amsterdam to see my sister Willow,

60
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,000
her husband, Alessandro and her kids,

61
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,440
Matteo and Sabe and my other sister lives in Holland,

62
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,240
Tiffany, her friend, Hido and my sister's son, Julius.

63
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,680
And it was great, we had a fantastic dinner,

64
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,040
we hadn't seen it, but it's been a little while since

65
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,480
we'd all kind of been together like that,

66
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,560
but really with the full families, it was a lot of fun.

67
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,160
And, but Willow, my sister from Italy,

68
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
I could tell she was kind of on the rope,

69
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,760
she had a really bad cold, she didn't feel well,

70
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,560
but she was young.

71
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,960
She's a woman, so you know, she didn't let on about that shit,

72
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,680
and she just stuck right through it.

73
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,840
And we stayed at the night in Amsterdam,

74
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,280
and there were about four or five in the morning,

75
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,200
I woke up and I said, oh man, I got a headache,

76
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,840
which is atypical for me, I don't wake up for anything.

77
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,840
And so, of course, that was the beginnings of

78
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,320
of what this flu would be for me.

79
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,360
So, by the time I got back, I was, which was Saturday,

80
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,800
I was starting to get pretty wiped out,

81
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,640
and it just went downhill from there.

82
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,920
Anyway, let's see, we, I do have a show for you,

83
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,840
filled with some flu-warm fraude and music for you,

84
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,920
but let's see what we got here.

85
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,320
Hello?

86
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,960
Hi Adam, this is Bigger Health from Silicon Valley.

87
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,400
Yeah, I wanted to just take a minute to say thank you.

88
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,400
Thank you for giving us

89
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,440
the by far, the best podcast out there.

90
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,200
You continue episode in an episode out to inform,

91
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,440
to educate, to entertain, and it's occasionally to irritate,

92
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,840
or infuriate us, but every episode is at learning experience,

93
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,440
and I get more thrill out of listening to your show

94
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,720
on my daily drive.

95
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,080
And I do from just about any of the other shows I've listened to,

96
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
or any other content I read,

97
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,720
really do appreciate all the work you put go,

98
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,520
that goes into putting the show together.

99
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,720
And as a result of all the time you spent,

100
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,560
and all the time I put into this new show,

101
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
I've finally taken to leap myself.

102
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,120
So if you could tell your listeners,

103
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,640
if they want to hear the stories of a more average American guy,

104
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,840
please send them to my podcast site at normalmanority.lipsen.com.

105
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,480
Again, Adam, thanks for all the great content.

106
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,160
I hope you have a fantastic day.

107
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,240
It's a big out of sign-in-off.

108
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,120
Yo yo, big out.

109
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,920
Thank you, my friend.

110
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,440
I need a mash-up, how about you?

111
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,680
I'm pleased to meet you.

112
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,400
It's the best of booty, two thousand seven DJ Moore.

113
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,080
You can't smile, I love you.

114
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,400

Pleased to meet you.

116
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800

Please allow me to introduce myself.

120
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,040
I'm a man, well, and taste.

121
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,840
I've been around for it all along you.

122
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,840
Still many amends, so to fit.

123
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,400
When I was around with Jesus Christ,

124
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,760
had his moment a doubt of pain.

125
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,880
Me, damn sure the pilot watched his hands,

126
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,240
the seal is great.

127
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,640
Pleased to meet you.

128
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,560
Hope you can't smile, I love you.

129
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,600
But what good led you with the nature of my game?

130
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,880
I've been too bad, they're contagious.

131
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:37,520
I'm a skater, my baby, I'm stupid, they're contagious.

132
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,200
I'm a skater, my baby, I'm a baby.

133
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
Pleased to meet you.

134
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,320
Hope you can't smile, I love you.

135
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,920
Pleased to meet you.

136
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,280
Still many amends, so to fit.

137
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,560
When I was around with Jesus Christ,

138
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,000
had his moment a doubt of pain.

139
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,040
Me, damn sure the pilot watched his hands,

140
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,600
I've been too bad, they're contagious.

141
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,640
I'm a skater, my baby, I'm a skater,

142
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,840
fit to meet you.

143
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,280
Hope you can't smile, I love you.

144
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,680
But I'm a skater, my baby,

145
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,600
they're contagious.

146
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,080
I'm a skater, my baby, I'm a skater,

147
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,400
I've been too bad, they're contagious.

148
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:44,720
I'm a skater, my baby, I'm stupid,

149
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
they're contagious.

150
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,560
I'm a skater, my baby, I'm a skater,

151
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,200
they're contagious.

152
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,760
Hope you can't smile, I love you.

153
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,120
Pleased to meet you.

154
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,800
I'm a skater, my baby, I'm a skater,

155
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,760
they're contagious.

156
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,360
I'm a skater, my baby,

157
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,220
I'm a skater, my baby,

158
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,040
they're contagious guys.

159
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,600
For stars,

160
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,720
I'd love to meet you,

161
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Queen's raw tender gays

162
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
For the god's name

163
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
I shout out

164
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Who killed the candidates

165
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,720
Where and thrall

166
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,720
It was me when

167
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Let the police ever do smile now

168
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,720
But I'm a man of wealth and taste

169
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,720
I need tracks for true love

170
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Who killed the four their reach

171
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Tomorrow they're coming back

172
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,720
To play

173
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,720
That's exactly the day

174
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
No, day, no

175
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
That's exactly the day

176
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Nothing, no, day

177
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
That's exactly the day

178
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
No, day, no

179
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
That's exactly the day

180
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
That's exactly the day

181
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
No, no, no

182
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
That's exactly the day

183
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
No, no, no

184
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
That's exactly the day

185
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,720
That's exactly the day

186
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
No, no, no

187
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,720
That's exactly the day

188
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,720
No, no, no

189
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,720
That's exactly the day

190
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,720
No, no, no

191
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Yeah, yeah

192
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Returned spirit

193
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
On your daily source code episode number

194
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
75

195
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
It is, uh, f5

196
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Wow, man. A lot of people sent me this link and of course, you know, I appreciate it. Don't ever think that millions of people sent the tune me already about the spot program from the our friends, the TSA spot stands for screening passengers by observation technique. Oh, yes.

197
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:29,720
It's now being called the face crime initiative on the on the internet. Essentially, in the spot program says,

198
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:37,720
who's this guy who's talking on behalf of the TSA. Hold on, let me just, my brains moving a little bit slower than normal as you can tell.

199
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Carl Maccario, this is who helps start this program for the TSA. Okay. So Carl is is the culprit here in the spot program.

200
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,720
We have a conversation with passengers and we asked them about their trip.

201
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:58,720
When someone lies or tries to deceive, there are behavior cues that show it a brief flash of fear.

202
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:07,720
The definition of terror, actually, such people are referred for secondary screening, which can include a pat down search and an x-ray exam.

203
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,720
The micro facial expressions are the same across many, many cultures.

204
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:23,720
Well, apparently since January 2006, this has been going on, behavior detection officers better better known as BDOs have referred about 70,000 people for secondary screening.

205
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:33,720
Of those, about 600 to 700, we're arrested on a variety of charges, including possession of drugs, weapons violations and outstanding warrants.

206
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Now, this is very interesting to me.

207
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:48,720
This essentially, and maybe it's something I should talk with John Devorek about on no agenda, which we may do today, but it may not be told to mark. Got to figure out what our timing is.

208
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Because they're supposed to be screening me for, you know, I guess if I'm going to do some, you know, trying to hijack an airplane.

209
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:12,720
But now essentially, this TSA, which is not really police, are, you know, basically searching me without just cause.

210
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,720
And, and they're searching for drugs and outstanding warrants.

211
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:30,720
I don't know. This is really, this is really quite strange. It's a little disconcerning that people are being pulled out of, you know, basically in a public place and airport in this manner.

212
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:41,720
I got to think about this. It doesn't, it doesn't sit well with me at all, particularly with me, as you know, I'm a mild case of Tourette syndrome.

213
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:52,720
But what's funny is in this article that actually says, let me see if I can find it, to emphasize the sensitivity TSA is bringing to the program.

214
00:17:52,720 --> 00:18:03,720
They had a meeting with an association for people with Tourette's disorder to assure that having a tick will not result in a pat down. Yeah, we'll see.

215
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:14,720
That's truly out of control. You know, over these past few days of Patricia has started getting interested in all of the stuff that I'm talking about and listening to.

216
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,720
And, you know, of course, I can't shut my big mouth when I see something on TV and I say, you know, this is not really what's happening. I think this is what's going on.

217
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:35,720
And, uh, that was, I'm going to say, uh, sorry. I lost my train of thought. It is a food bar Friday. Let's just hit a voicemail comment that'll help me out.

218
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:48,720
Okay, Adam, Jeff and Florida, bizarre travel experience. You would appreciate it on, uh, so the Christmas weekend flying out of Fort Lorda Dale heading for colonial Williamsburg, which is another story altogether.

219
00:18:48,720 --> 00:19:09,720
Show up at the airport. My girlfriend, I with our luggage, I've done the online boarding pass check in, but I still have to check my bags. It's real crowded. Don't really want to wait in the long lines. I go up to a TSA guy and just ask, you know, where's the curbside check in and can I do that if I have my online.

220
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:22,720
Produced boarding pass and he says, uh, don't worry about it. Come with me. I call my girlfriend off the line. He pulls us to the side takes my computer printed boarding passes never asks me for my ID.

221
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:39,720
Those behind the counter cuts the long line, punches some keys and comes out luggage tags, tags are three bags takes them away hands need properly printed boarding passes and we're on our way in three minutes. He never requested my ID for every rule in the book.

222
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:49,720
I shook his hands and slipped him 10 bucks. And as we walked to the security check and I wondered if maybe I've been scanned in my bag to just been stolen.

223
00:19:49,720 --> 00:20:00,720
But I looked at those printed receipts three or four times and they certainly looked legitimate and sure enough we arrived at our destination with our luggage there to meet us. So who knows?

224
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:11,720
It was my lucky day, I guess, or not, depending on how you look at it from the security standpoint. Anyway, hope you're not in great holiday season, thought with all your TSA talks, you'll enjoy that story.

225
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,720
I'm happy to have more more to tell Hollywood airport, by the way. Fantastic here.

226
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:38,720
All of a sudden remembered what I was telling Patricia was saying, the Travis Lee is that there are hundreds of thousands of American men and women fighting in the fucking desert and listen to the rhetoric, you know, to protect our freedom, the very same freedoms that are being taken away systematically every single day.

227
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Now you tell me how that works, okay?

228
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:52,720
Adam Man, it's right, I'm a lot of time listener, first time caller. You read one of my emails on mine before, but I'm here. I've been in state college Pennsylvania, Penn State, let's go.

229
00:20:52,720 --> 00:21:00,720
It's three o'clock in the morning, I'm a little behind on my source codes, but I just listened to 677, you're out of view with Dr. Ron Paul.

230
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:13,720
And the election coming up with you in the second election, I've ever had a chance to vote in, and you have influenced my leaning, did this, this is a huge thing.

231
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:23,720
I mean, I'm a couple of months behind, I've no idea what's going on now, but you've got the power to decide the next president of the United States of America.

232
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:30,720
I hope you recognize this power, and I hope you harness it for good, because with great power comes great responsibility.

233
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,720
Keep doing what you do and Adam have a good night.

234
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Yeah, well, that power ain't so my Mojo ain't in full strength apparently, looking at the, at the caucuses from yesterday.

235
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:55,720
I'm not going to get into it, because honestly, I don't really understand it, I don't understand how it works, all I know is that the only thing that counts is being number one.

236
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:10,720
Our guy was definitely not number one, so I'm already reading all kinds of theories, and I would just didn't put enough butts in the right seats in Iowa, I presume.

237
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,720
I'm just amazed by Huckabito, that's quite an amazing feat that he's pulled off there.

238
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:27,720
I'm pretty convinced that two things were really working well in his favor, which doesn't, it's probably not so good for, you know, us as a nation.

239
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,720
And I think that the Chuck Norris promotion worked very, very well.

240
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,720
I just got to hand it to him, what a great idea.

241
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:43,720
And also the appearance on Lena, I think, really helped a lot of people watch that.

242
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,720
So we'll see where this leads.

243
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:52,720
There are several more caucuses to come, as things start to heat up, and I still, of course, stand subtly behind my man, Dr. Ron Paul.

244
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Hi Adam, Mike from Wilmington, Delaware. I've been listening since before the counting started.

245
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,720
I'm a scroller, and I love it when pictures is on.

246
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,720
With that out of the way, I want to take a moment to share with you a little bit about a friend, a friend of my wife and I at misplaced.

247
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:15,720
Jimmy is a dear friend of my wife and me. He had been secretly struggling with addiction, and we didn't learn about it until it was too late.

248
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,720
When the secret came out, Jimmy fled Ohio with others who were probably using, and they probably went somewhere in the Cincinnati area.

249
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,720
We've not heard from Jimmy since the spring of 2007.

250
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:33,720
At the beginning of December this year, my wife contacted Jimmy's family, but they don't know where he is either.

251
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,720
But they could tell us as far as they know he's still in Ohio, and it's very likely that he's homeless.

252
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,720
We're torn apart about the loss of our friend, and even more so that it is likely that he's cold and lonely.

253
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:54,720
If anybody out there has seen Jimmy or Noah's current whereabouts, please contact us at our website, www.findingJimmy.org.

254
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Thank you for taking a moment to listen to this and a bigger thanks if you share it with the rest of the audience.

255
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,720
My hope is that someone may recognize him from the picture at www.findingJimmy.org

256
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,720
and contact me through the site so that I can reach out and try to help him.

257
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Thanks again, and I love you, man.

258
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
No homo.

259
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,720
I always kills me when you wind up with a no homo.

260
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,720
I still had this one queued up, I think, from the last show that I did as the one I did with Patricia.

261
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Like number one of the whole month of December from the Pod Save Music Network,

262
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Clark Dazzler, the classic Shadow Dreams.

263
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:03,720
What it was you who said they died for me.

264
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:13,720
And just see you giving me, giving me nothing but Shadow Dreams, Shadow Dreams.

265
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Feel like I could run away run away from this city.

266
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Oh, come to reality and found the future not so bright.

267
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:56,720
I dreamt the impossible, the name of things could work out right.

268
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:04,720
I thought it was you who said they died for me.

269
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:14,720
And just see you giving me, giving me nothing but Shadow Dreams, Shadow Dreams.

270
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:24,720
Feel like I could run away run away from this city.

271
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:34,720
You know you give me, giving me nothing but Shadow Dreams, Shadow Dreams.

272
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Feel like I could run away run away from this city.

273
00:26:42,720 --> 00:27:06,720
Oh, come to reality and found the future not so bright.

274
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:14,720
I thought it was you who said they died for me.

275
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:24,720
And just see you giving me, giving me nothing but Shadow Dreams, Shadow Dreams.

276
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,720
Feel like I could run away run away from this city.

277
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:44,720
You know you give me, giving me nothing but Shadow Dreams, Shadow Dreams.

278
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:56,720
Feel like I could run away run away from this city.

279
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:11,720
Oh, come to reality and find the future not so bright.

280
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:29,720
I dreamt the impossible, come on, dreamt the impossible.

281
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,720
It's from Mark Dadsler's new CD, it's titled Tomorrow.

282
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,720
And I just can't wait to find out what the next track will be that it'll be made hot safe.

283
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Honestly, I'm kind of hoping for the title track because it's great song.

284
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
We'll see.

285
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
Good, good, good stuff.

286
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,720
I guess it, man.

287
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Completely independent.

288
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Right on, Clark.

289
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,720
The weather is perfect.

290
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Perfect for the way I feel today.

291
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,720
There's snow in the air.

292
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,720
We're a little bit south of the snow borderline.

293
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,720
I think there's some wet snow up at Heathrow.

294
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
And so we're just a little bit south of that.

295
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,720
So nothing here yet that I can see.

296
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,720
But it's really, really dark outside.

297
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,720
And it's perfect weather to be stuck indoors with the no-row virus.

298
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Hey Adam, Chris, go out on here from Seattle.

299
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,720
I've been just listening to some of you remember what you have sort of was.

300
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
But it was the heat test with the envelope.

301
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,720
And I realized I didn't know any of the songs that he was playing.

302
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,720
Now, it's unusual for me because I'm actually really,

303
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720
I'm kind of a savante of 80s music trivia.

304
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,720
And I'm not challenging you or calling you out.

305
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,720
But I just kind of my thing.

306
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,720
And I realized a lot of times when young police stuff,

307
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,720
I have never heard the songs before.

308
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Not that I just don't remember what they are.

309
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
I just never heard them before.

310
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,720
And the life and I were discussing not too long ago as she grew up on the Heathcoats,

311
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
I grew up on the west coast.

312
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,720
And we have very different recollections about a lot of songs.

313
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,720
And I wondered if you could just talk for a minute about the regionality of radio,

314
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,720
especially 25 years ago as compared to what is popular now nationally.

315
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,720
And now it's all programmed by one place,

316
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,720
to the post to using a different regions of different flavors and different things

317
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
were popular.

318
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
I'd even more so in the 60s and 70s.

319
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,720
I just wanted you to kind of talk to that guy.

320
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,720
I think that's the way I work, but I don't know for sure.

321
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Anyway, thanks for what you do.

322
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
And I like you a lot.

323
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,720
I can't say that I love you yet.

324
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,720
Yeah, you know, I think that's that's pretty typical.

325
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
First of all, you know, young is from the Netherlands.

326
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,720
And we grew up with a whole different music scene in the very early 80s

327
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
when I was on the pirate radio station.

328
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
I mean, Madonna actually,

329
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,720
the album with the Lucky Star Holiday borderline.

330
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,720
That was out a year, a full year before it actually became a hit

331
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,720
worldwide, which I think started in the UK with

332
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
maybe it was borderline.

333
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
The borderline, it wasn't holiday.

334
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
Holiday was the big mega smash,

335
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
but Lucky Star maybe.

336
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,720
I think it was Lucky Star that came first.

337
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,720
That's right.

338
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,720
Yeah, I mean, there was all different kinds of music at the time.

339
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,720
The states was still very much into,

340
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,720
let's see, what was a big hit at the time of some of the songs

341
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,720
that young has been pulling from the last week's hit test.

342
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,720
I was probably Kenny Rogers and Daldy Park.

343
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
Islands in this dream.

344
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
No, no, no.

345
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,720
It's a, it is very different.

346
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,720
Of course, you know, the music industry, you know,

347
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
it's, it's mission.

348
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,720
It's, as always been to sell as much product as possible.

349
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,720
And so, you know, they focus.

350
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,720
And, you know, just the way the radio has traditionally worked

351
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,720
in the United States, which now is,

352
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,720
is ending, of course, we're seeing everything fall apart.

353
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,720
But, you know, it was a very simple system.

354
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,720
You release a number of songs.

355
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,720
You pay radio stations indirectly,

356
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,720
but make no mistake.

357
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,720
They were being promoted to by independent promoters

358
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
who actually gave out checks.

359
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Not directly to disjockeys and as all kinds of legal ways

360
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,720
they were getting around it.

361
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,720
But, you know, it's pay for play.

362
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,720
That's basically what the system has been.

363
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,720
And, and it always worked, which is, by the way,

364
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,720
which is why these guys are so pissed off

365
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,720
is because, you know, their whole system broke down.

366
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,720
You know, they're, they're cry babies.

367
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,720
So, yeah, I understand where,

368
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,720
for a lot of folks, this stuff is, you know,

369
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
you've never heard of this longs before.

370
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
Let's see what Yon has for us today, yeah.

371
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,720
It's got another crazy video.

372
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,720
You ready to be stumps,

373
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
because he used that full text.

374
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Yeah.

375
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,720
Hey, Adam, as you say, he tests number 103.

376
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Look at what we're looking good.

377
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,720
Let me wish all the deadly source coating is first,

378
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
best wishes from the Netherlands.

379
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,720
Very happy new year, 2008, and, uh,

380
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
make it a good one, okay?

381
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,720
All right, then.

382
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,720
All righty.

383
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
This is test.

384
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Number 103.

385
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
Here we go.

386
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,720
This is intro.

387
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Number 101.

388
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,720
Uh, you'd be 40.

389
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,720
Uh, it's, uh, go your week and go our own way.

390
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Uh, something like that.

391
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
Number two.

392
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
Uh, let no man put us under.

393
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,720
Um.

394
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,720
And the final one is number three.

395
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:32,720
That, that's, that, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that, that's it, that's, that's, that, that's, that's, that's, that, this is.

396
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,720
I'm trying to think of, it sounded like, it, sounded like,

397
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:41,720
what was the one before that sounded like it was, uh, letting no man put us, and times up, and these are the answers.

398
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,920
I know I have to do it.

399
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,920
And so number one is from 1986.

400
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,920
This is UV 40 and sing our own song.

401
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,720
Go your own way, sing your own song.

402
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
I want that.

403
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,120
We'll take half the point for that.

404
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,720
Answer number one is UV 40.

405
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,720
And this is Answer number two from 1986.

406
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
Yes.

407
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,720
This is first choice and let no man put his under.

408
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,720
First choice is Answer number three.

409
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,720
Two.

410
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,720
This is Answer number three from 1980 liquid goals.

411
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,720
All right everybody, we sing a lot now.

412
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:21,720
Then you're self-dizzy liquid goal is Answer number three.

413
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,720
And hit that number one.

414
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Oh three.

415
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,720
So that's it for the first hit test in 2008.

416
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
How did you do at them?

417
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,720
Like two full stars.

418
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
One has the answers.

419
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
To this hit test.

420
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,720
And also the I2 plane.

421
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
So you can buy these tracks online.

422
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,720
To be found at hittest.botshow.com.

423
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,720
So I don't thank you for playing everyone else.

424
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Thank you for listening.

425
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,720
I'll see you next week for hit test number 104.

426
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,720
So until then, take care.

427
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,720
Bye bye.

428
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,720
You really got to check out hittest.botshow.com.

429
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,720
And besides being able to get the iTunes tracks straight from the links.

430
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,720
You got to see the video version of the hit test.

431
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Young is really putting some energy into that.

432
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,720
It looks good.

433
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,720
He's got all them covers and all kinds of stuff going on.

434
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,720
It's a very very flash, very flashy production.

435
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Good choices there young.

436
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,720
Thank you so much.

437
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,720
Let me see.

438
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
Come at.

439
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,720
I had a message Justin from San Francisco.

440
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,720
I had two things for you today.

441
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,720
I had a book.

442
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
I thought you might find interesting.

443
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,720
Called the creature from Jackal Island.

444
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
It's called the second look at the Federal Reserve.

445
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,720
Great book.

446
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
I want to check that out.

447
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
And a movie I just found.

448
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,720
You should watch this movie.

449
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,720
It's a plane on Comcast on demand right now.

450
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,720
So the next time you're over in the city, check it out.

451
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,720
It's called Iraq for sale.

452
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
The war profit tiers.

453
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,720
It talks about the connections between Blackwater, Haliburton, KBR, Titan, Awesome

454
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,720
Awesome movie.

455
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,720
I think you might be interested in it.

456
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
All right, man.

457
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
Talk to you later.

458
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,720
Thank you very much.

459
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,720
Yeah, I've heard about both of those.

460
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,720
And of course, that Island is a whole conspiracy theory about that.

461
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,720
That's in many.

462
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,720
There are so many videos that are being produced now.

463
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:19,720
And it's it's flabbergasting almost when you see all this fantastic stuff that people

464
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,720
are putting together telling stories right wrong and different.

465
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,720
But they're telling stories in such a compelling way.

466
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,720
I'm very, very excited about it.

467
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,720
And there's this one thing that.

468
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,720
And then I'm definitely going to bring up on Noah gender.

469
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,720
Hold on a second.

470
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,720
Let me just see if I can find this link.

471
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
It wasn't actually going to talk about it right now.

472
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:47,720
But I've, you know, I have never wondered where the name Al Qaeda came from.

473
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:53,720
And as I've been doing my research, I've been looking around.

474
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,720
And the name Al Qaeda.

475
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:04,720
Apparently is an is Arabic or a dialect of Arabic that means the database.

476
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,720
And it is my understanding from the research that I've done, which comes from some pretty

477
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,720
reliable sources.

478
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,720
I'd have to say the Guardian in the UK is reasonably reliable.

479
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
They've mentioned this as well.

480
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,720
It's been published several times throughout the years.

481
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,720
That it was a name that was made up when.

482
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:28,720
The U.S. when the CIA was essentially supporting a summer bin Laden.

483
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,720
And the Mujahideen to kick the Russians out of Afghanistan.

484
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,720
They built up a database of freedom fighters.

485
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
And that was called the al Qaeda.

486
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,720
The database was called the al Qaeda.

487
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:49,720
So the whole name, the whole origin of this al Qaeda is actually as far as I can tell in American

488
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,720
invention.

489
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,720
And it's just flabbergasting to me.

490
00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:01,720
Now, whenever I hear anyone talk about al Qaeda, particularly, I've heard several politicians

491
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,720
talk about it who actually should know better.

492
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,720
They should really know, I mean, ask one of these guys.

493
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,720
Where does this al Qaeda come from?

494
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,720
Who came up with the name al Qaeda?

495
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,720
It's pretty interesting to read.

496
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:22,720
Let me see if I can find that Guardian article.

497
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,720
Hold on.

498
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,720
I wasn't really prepared for this, but I was just thinking about it.

499
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,720
I don't want to say I want to get it from one of these.

500
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,720
Here we go.

501
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
The Guardian.

502
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Okay.

503
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,720
Here it is.

504
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:41,720
This is from July 8th, 2005.

505
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,720
Oh boy.

506
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,720
Hold on one second.

507
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,720
Okay.

508
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
I got it here.

509
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,720
Bin Laden was a product of monumental miscalculation by Western security agencies.

510
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:02,720
Throughout the 80s, he was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis to wage Jihad against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan.

511
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:10,720
Al Qaeda, literally the database, was originally the computer file of the thousands of Mujahideen,

512
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:18,720
who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians, inexplicably, and with disastrous consequences,

513
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,720
it never appears to have occurred to Washington that once Russia was out of the way, Bin Laden's organization

514
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,720
returned its attention to the West.

515
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:34,720
So having links to al Qaeda literally means that the CIA has linked that person to their database.

516
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,720
It's an extrapolation, but I think you understand where I'm going with all of this stuff.

517
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,720
Interesting.

518
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,720
All right.

519
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,720
Because of the flu, I've been slowed down severely.

520
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,720
And I'm just, we're already 40 minutes into this.

521
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:58,720
And I want to leave you with a song that PDUB sent this to me, our good friend, PDUB-Ethenton,

522
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,720
to some affectionately known as the Satellite Repairman.

523
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,720
It's a YouTube video, actually, from Randy Newman.

524
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,720
And it's kind of a downer when you listen to it, but I'm going to close out the show with it today.

525
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:19,720
And that'll kind of close out the bummerness of 2007, so I can start Monday, a fresh with 2008,

526
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,720
and we'll really get into the swing of things.

527
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,720
It's titled a few words in defense of our country, and I think it's well worth a listen.

528
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:33,720
I was recently in Europe, and despite all we've done for them, and to them, they don't like us very much.

529
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,720
You don't respect us at all.

530
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:43,720
And I want to reply to their score in a song, which is the following.

531
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:54,720
I like to say the few words, defense of our country,

532
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:02,720
which people aren't bad, nor the mean.

533
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:10,720
Now, the leaders we have, while they're the worst that we've had.

534
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,720
A heart in the worst is poor world is seen.

535
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,720
Let's turn history's pages shall we?

536
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,720
Take the season's folks, example, while at the first few of them,

537
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,720
it was sweet with their sister, stage and little boys and swimming pools and burdened down the city.

538
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:34,720
One of them, one of them, supported his own horse to be crowned through the empire,

539
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
that's like vice president or something.

540
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,720
That's not a very good example right now, isn't it?

541
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,720
But he is one.

542
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,720
Spanish it wasish.

543
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,720
That's a good one.

544
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,720
Put people in the terrible position.

545
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,720
I don't even like to think about it.

546
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,720
Sometimes I like to think about it.

547
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,720
Just a few words.

548
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,720
Defense of our country.

549
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,720
It's time at the top.

550
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:09,720
I'm going to become a new anian.

551
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,720
We don't want their love.

552
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,720
Respect this points pretty much out of the question.

553
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,720
Time at the end.

554
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:25,720
We're sure we can use a friend.

555
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,720
He will.

556
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,720
Stalin.

557
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,720
I mean, you need to know what you're doing.

558
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,720
King Leopold about it.

559
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,720
That's right.

560
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,720
Everyone thinks he's so great.

561
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,720
We own the cargo.

562
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
He tore up too.

563
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,720
Took the diamonds.

564
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,720
Took the silver.

565
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,720
Took the gold.

566
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,720
You know what he left him with?

567
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,720
Well, there he is.

568
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,720
You know, president once said,

569
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,720
the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

570
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,720
Not seems like we're supposed to be afraid.

571
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,720
It's patriotic in fact.

572
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,720
The color coat.

573
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,720
Are we supposed to be afraid of?

574
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,720
Why being afraid?

575
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,720
That's what term means, doesn't it?

576
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,720
That's what he used to mean.

577
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,720
You know what pisses me off a little

578
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,720
to the Supreme Court's going to have lived me?

579
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,720
A couple of young Italian fellows in the brother

580
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,720
on the court now too.

581
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,720
But I'd defy you anywhere in the world

582
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,720
to find me two Italians,

583
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,720
as tight ass as two Italians we got.

584
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,720
Nice for the brother.

585
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,720
Well, it was not a planet anymore either.

586
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:53,720
The end of an empire is messy at best.

587
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,720
And this empire's ending.

588
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,720
Like all the rest.

589
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,720
Not to Spanish our mother.

590
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,720
Drift down the sea.

591
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,720
We're drifting the land to the brave.

592
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,720
No more to free.

593
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,720
Good bye.

594
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,720
Good bye.

595
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,720
Good bye.

596
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,720
All right, Brandi Newmanberg.

597
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,720
I wouldn't say it's all that bad actually,

598
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:34,720
but what a great song to wrap up the Fubar Friday.

599
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,720
Ah, they're still home, my friends.

600
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,720
Vote for Ron Paul.

601
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,720
Enjoy your freedom.

602
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,720
And please live life with passion.

603
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,720
Imagine headphones without wires.

604
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,720
Now their Sony's Bluetooth wireless headset.

605
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,720
A rechargeable listening experience

606
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,720
with 11 hours of music playback.

607
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,720
So you and your music are free to move.

608
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,720
Pick up yours at Sony.com slash headphones.

609
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,720
Sony wireless headphones.

610
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,720
Your music are unplugged.
