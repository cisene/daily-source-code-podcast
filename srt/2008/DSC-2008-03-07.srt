1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Uhhh...Fubile...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Ho Chi! Ho Chi! Get the camera quick, here comes Adam Curry in the DSC 732!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strap to my ass.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We don't need no sticky and crispy.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
On testing, this madam Curry!?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
1K1…

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Bat on your face!

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Tonight I....I'll be with you tonight tonight

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Tonight...I'll be with you tonight

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,980
Tonight

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Tonight

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's for everybody

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You've got to burn it, burn it with the time

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You've got to burn it, burn it with the time

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You've got to burn it with the time

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You've got to burn it with the time

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You've got to think and think you want to do

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
No matter how many we do

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, no, no, no, no, no

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Just don't be my hand, my hands, my arms

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Don't come closer, come dear

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Tonight you'll be the first light

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Then I'll be the little do

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You can't be so silent

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not showed alone, no, no

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Tonight you'll be here

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And I'll tell you it's thanks to

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Tonight is all the rain

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll be with you tonight

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Tonight, I'll be with you tonight

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Tonight, I'll be with you tonight

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Tonight, I'll be with you tonight

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Tonight, I'll be with you tonight

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Tonight, I'll be with you tonight

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Tonight, I'll be with you tonight

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Tonight, I'll be with you tonight

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Tonight, I'll be with you tonight

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Tonight, I'll be with you tonight

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I want to throw them all around the world together

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Tonight they'll be the first night that I've been in love with you

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're getting me so excited

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm not sure what I'm going to do

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Tomorrow you won't be here

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And I don't expect too

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Tonight is all I remember

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm here for you, for you

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm from you

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Tonight tonight

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll be with you tonight

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Tonight is all I remember

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Tonight is all I remember

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Tonight is all I remember

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,440
Oh man, nothing kicks off a full bar quite like Chief Trig, nor I'm saying tonight.

57
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,160
It is Denny Source code episode number 732 coming to you from the affluent suburb of

58
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,320
Surrey known as Gilford, West Side of G-town up in Adams attic in the curry manner.

59
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,800
Boy, the description just gets longer and longer, doesn't it?

60
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:03,120
Ah, it's a beautiful day blue skies, couple of clouds, windows wide open, and the microphone

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,440
throttle pedal to the metal because the full bar is on and full effect that means maximum

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:15,120
music, minimum BS, and all the tunes that fit into the soundtrack of your lives, proudly

63
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,520
presented by the organization for the preservation to the soundtrack of your lives.

64
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,920
So from Chief Trig we head on over to Jersey, that's where the next track comes from.

65
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,240
I had in Jersey Joe here, please check out this artist to grow it up to the positive news

66
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
network.

67
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,680
My name is Marin, it's Morris, he's 17 years old, it looks like a lot of talent.

68
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,080
Thanks, and we'll see you on the jury side in the fight.

69
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:08,520
Today, you want it to go with it, be over at about this stage, just what you want

70
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
to know.

71
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:19,080
And I know what sets it to that, you stay, but I can't stay, because I know how to say to

72
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:37,840
reverse, yeah, I've been once you walk on the wild side before, but you're just

73
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:47,120
you must for me, must for me, yeah, I say it's gonna be okay, but yeah, I trust you,

74
00:05:47,120 --> 00:06:01,840
and I'll give you one more day, get out of here, be over at about this stage, just what

75
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:12,160
you want to know, and I know what sets it to that, you stay, but I can't stay, because I know

76
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:34,900
you're saying, you're偷.

77
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:41,900
You wanted to know this would be alright

78
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:52,900
You wanted to know this would be alright

79
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,900
Right, yeah, yeah

80
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,900
You wanted to know this would be alright

81
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:18,900
I got to make today a celebration of sorts just a private little celebration because man so much has happened in the past couple of months

82
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:31,900
I think starting in November we went on a whole new reinvention tour

83
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,900
Of the pod show, I'm sorry Martin, let me show you a second

84
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,900
Let the youth take over

85
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,900
There we go

86
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,900
Martin Morris, you can find out the pod save music network links in the show notes of course at dailysourcecode.com

87
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,900
And thanks to Jersey Joe for calling that one

88
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,900
And also Jersey Todd, tip that one as well

89
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,900
Todd, the official musicologist always sends in a couple of choices from me to select from

90
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,900
For the Jersey Todd contribution and of course, Jersey Todd will be up in a little bit later on in the show

91
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,900
As I was saying, it feels like kind of a celebration man, there's so much has been happening

92
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,900
We figured out really two real rock solid ways of, oh gee, making money

93
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,900
So that's kind of good because that's kicking into gear

94
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,900
We've got new designs on the way of course v3 on the heels of that

95
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,900
There's just so much going on new show being produced as we speak the legends of rock

96
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,900
We've been able to license some awesome live performances from true legends

97
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,900
So that's being worked on as we speak in fact

98
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,900
I did the, I did the voiceovers earlier this morning

99
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,900
That's why the voice is so low

100
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,900
The legends of rock

101
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,900
Oh man, so maximum music football Friday

102
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,900
It's been a while since we don't one of these and I feel in perfect shape

103
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,900
A couple of calls that I do want to share with you

104
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,900
The first one from James who of course has been calling to the program for a number of years now

105
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,900
Pretty much ever since I hit the UK

106
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,900
The island, the island, the island of the United Kingdom

107
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,900
And James has got a gripe

108
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,900
Not just about to close circuit television cameras in the UK

109
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,900
And the way I view those or the way they view me

110
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,900
But also about his comments and general James

111
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,900
I don't James

112
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,900
So don't feel like you're sometimes not all the time

113
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,900
But sometimes his body is the media

114
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,900
I'll set you in a meal and I know you read my emails because you respond to them

115
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,900
And sometimes just sometimes you don't play in my comments

116
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,900
Sometimes you don't read my emails

117
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,900
That James James James, I just want to say one thing

118
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,900
Do you know how many comments I receive

119
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,900
And the biggest problem is the length

120
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,900
You know when you're calling in a two minute comment or three minutes

121
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,900
It's just too long

122
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,900
It just takes up too much time

123
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,900
And sometimes your topics are very specific

124
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,900
So it's not that I don't love you man

125
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,900
And it's not that I don't care

126
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,900
It's not that I'm the filter

127
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,900
Well I am filtering

128
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,900
Sometimes I just don't feel like talking about what you're talking about

129
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,900
No I'm saying

130
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,900
But I do save them all

131
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,900
And I look at them every single day

132
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,900
On the podcast

133
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,900
Which is fair enough

134
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,900
I've got no problems with that verse

135
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,900
As general rule

136
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,900
Because yes you sometimes think my comments are interesting

137
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,900
That's fair enough

138
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,900
I've got no problem with that

139
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,900
But sometimes I have to be involved with this here

140
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,900
And you still don't play it

141
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,900
And that is your filtering

142
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
Sometimes you're calling from the car

143
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,900
And it's hard to understand your James

144
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,900
Your filtering what you want to hear

145
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,900
And sometimes I think that's because you think it might sway

146
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,900
People's judgment on your way of thinking

147
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,900
The one I'm talking about is this 16 thing thing

148
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,900
So I reiterated for the podcast verbally

149
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,900
So it may get clear

150
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
We've got 3...

151
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,900
6 billion cameras in the UK

152
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,900
Something like that

153
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,900
I was a 10

154
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
Or you'd buy to buy anyway

155
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
So then we've got those cameras on

156
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,900
And 24 hours a day

157
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,900
365 days a year

158
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,900
So somebody else can do the maths

159
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,900
Basically that's a lot of hours

160
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,900
Let's say 188 cameras

161
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,900
Adam, nobody's fucking watching you

162
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,900
Stop being such a paranoid fuckman

163
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,900
Nobody is sitting watching

164
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,900
This many billions of hours in CCTV

165
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,900
It isn't fucking happening

166
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
It's used reactively

167
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,900
It's used when a little girl goes missing

168
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,900
They go and look at the CCTV cameras and go

169
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,900
Right, we saw past this problem

170
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,900
We saw going to this shop

171
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,900
It happens when somebody holds a bank

172
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
It's very bad quality

173
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,900
But we get the picture of the girl

174
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,900
That's got the bonus place

175
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,900
Played into the casiers

176
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,900
Nobody is watching Adam

177
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Cool content

178
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,900
Ask me how do I feel

179
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,900
As we know that we're cozy and cleaning

180
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,900
Well all I can say is if I were a bell I'd be ringing

181
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,900
From the moment we kissed tonight

182
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,900
That's the way I've just got to be

183
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,900
Hey girl if I were a lamp I'd light

184
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,900
And if I were about a right way

185
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,900
Ask me how do I feel

186
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Little me with my quiet upbringing

187
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,900
Well all I can say is if I were a game

188
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,900
I'd be swinging

189
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,900
And if I were a watch I'd start

190
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,900
Popping my spray

191
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,900
Or if I were a bell I'd go

192
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,900
Tim, dong, ding, dong, ding

193
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

194
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

195
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

196
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

197
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

198
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

199
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

200
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

201
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

202
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

203
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

204
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

205
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

206
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

207
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

208
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

209
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah

210
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah

211
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah

212
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah

213
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah

214
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah

215
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah

216
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
Yeah, yeah

217
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,900
Yeah, yeah

218
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

219
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah

220
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah

221
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

222
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

223
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,900
Triless, and I'm learning.

224
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:04,900
Well, all I can say is if I were a bridge I'd be learning.

225
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Yes, I knew my morale would crack

226
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,900
From the wonderful way that you look.

227
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,900
Girl, if I were a duck I'd quack

228
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,900
Or if I were a goose I'd be caught

229
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,900
How do I feel?

230
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Now that we're finally crescent

231
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Well, if I were a solid I'd know

232
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,900
I'd be splashing my dressing

233
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:43,900
Asked me how to describe this whole beautiful thing

234
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:49,900
Well, if I were a bell I'd go ding-dong ding-dong ding

235
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,900
Justin Marcus, if I were a bell

236
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,900
Also from the pod save music network

237
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,900
What a diversity we have there, huh?

238
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,900
And it's all for free enjoy

239
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,900
Put it in your show, promote the music

240
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,900
And may all your Fridays be football

241
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,900
Is a woman from a Billboard magazine who's doing the rounds

242
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,900
She's she's contacted several prominent podcasters

243
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,900
Also myself

244
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,900
Although she contacts him some other prominent ones before me

245
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,900
I found out

246
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,900
And it looks like she's doing an article on the promotion

247
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,900
Valpromotional value of podcast

248
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,900
Boy, do we have a story to tell?

249
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,900
I can't wait, I'm very excited about that

250
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,900
That should really reset the bar for the music industry

251
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,900
Because Billboard people do read it

252
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,900
But it's really an industry magazine

253
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,900
I remember people used to go and buy it

254
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,900
You know, to find out was on the charts and to read the stories

255
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,900
But now it's really become

256
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,900
They might be in pretty much an industry type magazine

257
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,900
So that should be pretty exciting

258
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,900
Get some more promotion out there for the pod save music

259
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,900
Now work in the artists and producers who participate in the revolution

260
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,900
So you can tell the high-pitched wine has gone

261
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,900
I figured that one out

262
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,900
We are yet one step closer to having the perfect set of

263
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,900
Not only that, but I've also improved my

264
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,900
Headphone amplifier

265
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,900
So I need this shit loud man, the older I get

266
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,900
The louder it has to be

267
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:23,900
I've got an email, which is clearly an automatic email

268
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,900
It's in German, so I won't bore you with my attempt at reading it and pronouncing it

269
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,900
Apparently what it seems to have done is gone out

270
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,900
There's a system called PhoneCaster.de

271
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,900
They automatically go out and are parsing XML feeds

272
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,900
And are making those available on their own telephone numbers

273
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,900
So you can call in to a German, actually here

274
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
Let me do it on my cell phone for a second

275
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,900
Let me see if I can find it

276
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
I know I called it earlier, here we go

277
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,900
Those of you who want to play along at home

278
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,900
You would do in your cell phone plus four nine

279
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,900
nine three one six six three nine three three one eight

280
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,900
Let me pop that up right now

281
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
I'm just going to hold the phone up to the microphone

282
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,900
So you can hear what happens. This is pretty interesting

283
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,900
And I just have one question about it, so there's ringing

284
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,900
Hold on

285
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,900
I'll watch it now work now, right?

286
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,900
Let's see

287
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Hello

288
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,900
Hello, is DailyStores called home

289
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,900
The hell is that?

290
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,900
It sounds like

291
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,900
Now it sounds like I hit the middle of the show somehow

292
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,900
Is that when's they show or Thursday show?

293
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,900
Yeah, interesting. I thought it would start at the beginning

294
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,900
Okay

295
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,900
Anyway, so my main question was this 0931 number

296
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,900
Is that a, it says it's a regular network cost

297
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,900
At least that's what I can translate from what I'm reading here in the email

298
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,900
From phonecaster.de

299
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,900
But I'm interested, I'm interested who's behind it how it works

300
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,900
And if it costs anything super extra

301
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,900
Because I have to say the quality was surprisingly good

302
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,900
Coming through the phone

303
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,900
And I'm not a big fan of these things usually

304
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,900
But this, you know having a, you don't have to enter a pin number

305
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
Have your own dedicated phone number

306
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
Interesting, so German friends, let me know

307
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
Hey, it is a football Friday

308
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,900
And tomorrow I've got an interesting day ahead

309
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,900
Christina has an audition

310
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,900
I can't tell you what the project is for

311
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,900
But it's an existing television series

312
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,900
And she has to go to Europe to continental Europe

313
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
In order to do the audition

314
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,900
Now the part is, I would say almost written for the way it looks

315
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
I mean, it's unbelievably perfect

316
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,900
So I'm sure she'll be, she'll be great at it

317
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,900
Now of course the question is, are we going to fly tomorrow

318
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,900
Together on easy jet

319
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,900
Or will the weather be nice enough

320
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
That I take her in the Delta Share

321
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,900
And we go over back and forth

322
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
I obviously know what my preference is

323
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
But I've kind of got to get a good hand along the weather

324
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,900
Because if it's going to be bumpy

325
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,900
I don't want to put her through that

326
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
Particularly not once she's already

327
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,900
A little bit nervous for the audition

328
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,900
And of course, it's being football Friday

329
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,900
There's one highlight of everybody's week

330
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
It's got to be the hit test here's young pole light

331
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,900
One challenging casting with Adam Curry

332
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
Adam, are you ready to be stumps?

333
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,900
Hell yeah

334
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Because he is the hit test with young pole light

335
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,900
Yeah Adam, hit test number 112

336
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,900
Okay

337
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,900
And we're going to start right away with intro number one

338
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,900
It's a easy easy peasy

339
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,900
Pointing in part

340
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,900
Fahanaanaana

341
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,900
Michael Jackson rock with you

342
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,900
Of course it is the 25th anniversary of the thriller album

343
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,900
So it doesn't surprise me

344
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,900
Number two

345
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,900
It's either Kim Wild Cambodian

346
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Or it's a visage fade degree

347
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,900
I'm going to go with Kim Wild actually

348
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,900
And this is intro number three

349
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,900
Whenever I hear that kind of like

350
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,900
Going to do it

351
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,900
I always think of the SOS band

352
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
But I'm sure I'm wrong

353
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,900
All right

354
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
I think I got two out of three this week

355

360
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900

361
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,900

362
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,900
I think it's done

363
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,900

365
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,900
Two

366
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
Two

367
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
Three

368
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,900
Two

369
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,900
Four

370
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,900

371
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,900

372
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
Four

373
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,900
Six

374
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,900
Four

375
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
Four

376
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,900
Four

377
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,900
Four

378
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,900
Four

379
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,900
Four

380
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,900
Four

381
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,900
Four

382
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,900
Four

383
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,900
Four

384
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,900
Four

385
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
Four

386
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,900
Two

387
00:20:50,900 --> 00:21:04,900
And this is answer number 1.

388
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,900
Yes, Kim Wild.

389
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,900
Yeah, it's from 1982.

390
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
I was just clubbing.

391
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,900
Wild and Kim Boja.

392
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,900
But he was tired of this.

393
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,900
She wasn't ever as well.

394
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,900
He had jobs to do.

395
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,900
Yeah, he did.

396
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,900
Yeah, he did.

397
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,900
Kim Boja by Kim Wild is answer number 2.

398
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,900
And this is answer number 3.

399
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,900
From 1989, Sydney Youngblood.

400
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,900
They've only I could.

401
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:16,900
It's a shame we're only allowed to play about 30 seconds of each track.

402
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,900
Most of the time I really want to play every little detail of every track.

403
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,900
Okay, well, we just can't.

404
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,900
Sydney Youngblood, if only I could have answered number 3.

405
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,900
In today's, this week's hit-ish time is same.

406
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,900
All right, Adam, how did you do?

407
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,900
Two out of three on.

408
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,900
I knew I'd do okay.

409
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,900
If I had time to update the website, hit test.

410
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
That part show dot com.

411

That is the place to find the answers to this hit-ish,

412
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,900
and also the links to iTunes.

413
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:54,900
So that you can play or sorry by these tracks and flying.

414
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,900
Alrighty, thank you for playing, Adam.

415
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,900
Next week, I'll be back for hit-ish number 113.

416
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,900
So until then, have a great time and take care.

417
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,900
Bye-bye.

00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,900
We back, hit test at gmail.com!

419
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,900
In four young pull-up dots com...

420
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,900
7 N P O E O Y O E D C C C C C C C!

421
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Oh man!

422
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,900
Here in that Kim Wildtrak really took me back for a second.

423
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,900
I was just doing my first television gig in the Netherlands

424
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,900
and Kim was on the show and she was much younger

425
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,900
at the time as well.

426
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,900
I think she's maybe two or three years older than I am.

427
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,900
And I was,

428
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,900
I was in 1920s, something like that.

429
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,900
Oh man, I was, I was in love with her.

430
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,700
God, she was the perfect woman.

431
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:43,700
I met her again a couple years later, I knew York, she did a showcase when I was at MTV.

432
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,620
And it was kind of weird because Patricia was there.

433
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,420
And somehow I didn't feel the love coming back.

434
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:58,980
Hi, Adam, it's Matt from Game To Evil.

435
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,700
On this week's show, we've got a review of a beautiful catamari on the Xbox 360.

436
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,580
You can also win yourself a copy of that game.

437
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,820
I also play Res HD on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

438
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,560
And we get a little chat with the guys from Sega about their new game, Viking, Battle

439
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,560
for Asgard.

440
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,860
That's all at gamesweasel.com.

441
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:47,740
Still the snow keeps falling, till we can't keep out the cold, but they don't know that my

442
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,740
back was broken back.

443
00:24:50,740 --> 00:25:02,740
I'm so no, I can hardly move until dawn now.

444
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:11,740
And so you get the love to win the league.

445
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,740
Some people say...

446
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:35,740
Man, I dream of silence lying, and I left you so far below where I can't say,

447
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:40,740
where the world is from the land.

448
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:53,740
It's so hard to just watch you play, but you can't say.

449
00:25:53,740 --> 00:26:09,740
Some people say...

450
