1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Shara Charley's 7-6-4.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is the deadly source code.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Oh, I'm going to be!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
$16 billion worth of airplane scrapped by us.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Do the next generation radio contenting my ears.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We don't need not to dig into it.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I guess it is that I'm going to die now.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:44,000
$15 billion worth of airplane scrapped by us.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,500
I can't expect that I'm a world like that

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,000
I can't expect that I'm like that

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I can't expect that I'm a damn thing

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Go wild, wild, wild, wild, wild

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I can't expect that I'm a damn thing

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,000
Go wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I can't expect that I'm a damn thing

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,780
Here big blue, old, that will fit face

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,140
The Japanese lot the fabstar don't waste time

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,900
On the mic to gerade stop, jump, jump, flip a jump

21
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,900
And I'm here too thus.

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,240
Being delivered to make your shake the panic of the chance

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,500
I'm coming in to hand-guys perfect girl

24
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,240
Don't wait, make the world.

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,720
It's show rolling, AM 10!

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,000
It's world it's world trying to get mad

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's never unsure but it's true

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The dance floor for your heart

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Can't sense the air

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
More day yeah everybody over here

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Everybody over there

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The crowd is livin' up in this

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Body people in the house

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's a lie

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Who's that lie?

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Who's that lie?

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Everybody over there

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
BENNING

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000

We're tribal people

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We're tribal people

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We're tribal people

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We're tribal people

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,240
Lower units, ramps in all security

47
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,440
Balance feelings, peace in all burden

48
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,000
Coachella!

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Rock city, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man,

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,480
from the curry manner, we're on the west side of G-town,

52
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,180
the affluent suburb of Surrey, known as Gilford.

53
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,360
All boy, I gotta, I gotta topic for you today.

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,800
We're not gonna be talking about oil,

55
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
we're not gonna be talking about nuclear,

56
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,280
we're gonna be talking about Europe,

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,280
in particular about the European Union,

58
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,040
and specifically the Irish,

59
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,240
because we've got a huge event coming up here

60
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,520
in just a couple days about what is today,

61
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,000
the third, so in nine days from now,

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,600
an historic event will take place,

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,840
which could literally change the course

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,080
of the European Union.

65
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,680
As you know, Europe is turning into United States of Europe.

66
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,880
There's a number of steps that have been taken to get there.

67
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,080
This actually started back in 1945,

68
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,960
right after the Second World War,

69
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,680
there's ties to the United Nations,

70
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,960
which of course was funded initially

71
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,520
by the Rockefeller family,

72
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,040
which makes it all that more interesting, doesn't it?

73
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,640
But that's perhaps for a bit later,

74
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,360
I would like to say that I'm gonna make the show relatively short.

75
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,080
It'll be probably about a regular Charlie Length,

76
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,000
but there won't be a whole lot of topics in here,

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,520
because it's really gonna focus on one main topic

78
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,840
after we get through a couple of important notices.

79
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,040
Now, if you're Irish, meaning you live in Ireland

80
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,640
or have family or friends who live in Ireland,

81
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,320
you definitely want to take note of this show,

82
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,120
and you're gonna want to send them links to it,

83
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,280
and you're gonna want to back up some of your knowledge

84
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,320
of what I'm gonna talk to you about today

85
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,880
with a documentary, which has been released on the internet.

86
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,160
You can find it at curry.com.

87
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,280
Of course, I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

88
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,920
Frick, maybe I'll even embed it into the show notes today,

89
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,280
because it's well worth it if you haven't seen it.

90
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,400
And it's about the European Union and the Lisbon Treaty,

91
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,680
and it's pretty shocking when you find out what's going on.

92
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,880
So you can look forward to that.

93
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,520
You could fast forward if you want to,

94
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,480
because right now I have some other very important business

95
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,600
to take care of.

96
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,080
As you know, I'm pretty convinced that I'm one of those people

97
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,840
who people want to really give me any props

98
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,040
for anything until I'm dead and gone,

99
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,920
and maybe I'll get a little pod father on the tombstone there,

100
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,360
although hopefully if you have something else,

101
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,040
but that's a total possibility.

102
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,520
But we lost one.

103
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,640
We lost a real good one just yesterday,

104
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,960
Bo didly passed away, who, of course,

105
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,240
was just a monster when it comes to rock and roll, really.

106
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,560
And the number of people that he influenced with his songs,

107
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,360
with his guitar, the way he played, his riffs,

108
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,960
is just so many artists have been influenced by him.

109
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,360
And he passed away at 79, which I think is,

110
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,280
oh, man, that's still, that's not old enough.

111
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,840
I sure as hell, hope I make more than 79.

112
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,240
And I was thinking, so how can we best pay tribute to him?

113
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,800
And well, lo and behold, upshowed a comment

114
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,920
from Gary Alexander, who, of course, is a member

115
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,640
of the Muvio pod, pod cast network, excuse me.

116
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,920
And he had a pretty good suggestion,

117
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,040
and I just want to share that with you

118
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,120
and the song that he attributes to Bo didly.

119
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,040
Hey, Adam is Gary Alexander from the ultimate pod cast.

120
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,880
In the wake of the Bo didly passing,

121
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,120
I wanted to bring to your attention

122
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,520
a song that you have played of mine on the DSC4s called,

123
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,200
once upon a time in America, and it basically

124
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,440
takes a trip through all the, in my opinion,

125
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,040
all the styles of American music that have made it so great

126
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,400
that I love.

127
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,320
And in the middle of that song, you can hear a bit

128
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,880
of a tribute to Bo didly on the drums.

129
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,520
You'll hear a bit of that traditional, you know,

130
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,000
for Tom kind of a group, a bit of a 60's feel

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,600
in the chorus, and a bit of John Melanchamp,

132
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,320
and just a bit of the boss.

133
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,840
You're going to hear it all in that song.

134
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,040
Obviously, I'm a big fan of Bo didly.

135
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,280
I'm a big fan of all American music,

136
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,040
a big fan of music in general, from every country,

137
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,200
especially American music being that I'm

138
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,480
pouring bread and one option of proud to be an American

139
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,680
proud of the accelerators, a matter of fact.

140
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,480
You'll hear a little bit of Ronnie Van Zance

141
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,120
from Learn Skinner, Dean Flint, and there as well.

142
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,280
So even if you don't play it on the show, my friend,

143
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,000
I hope you take another listen to that song,

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,480
and think of the wonderful songs that Bo didly gave us.

145
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,240
Even though you all had that same group,

146
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,360
they're all great.

147
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,240
I could go bright on a Friday night,

148
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,080
down on the thunder road.

149
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,640
I was only not standing in line,

150
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,080
as brings things show.

151
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,720
I had a plan for rockin' roll band,

152
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,320
having made it in the shade.

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,520
I was gonna be a star with a bunch of young kids up.

154
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,720
All that song, what I say.

155
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,480
Nice, nice, nice.

156
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,480
I made me want to hold on my sleeve,

157
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,880
I was so cold, I'm in America.

158
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,120
I was so cold, I'm in America.

159
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm gonna be a star with so much time,

160
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,520
and I'm feeling fine, in my neighborhood.

161
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
It seems she told she's far as hate,

162
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,840
I mean she's looking good.

163
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:13,860
But she's so pale girl with the times

164
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,720
I'm being injuries and I'm feeling better.

165
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,720
I'm Mr. Romeo, this one's name is Blue Jeans

166
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,720
There's girls like this

167
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,720
They made me want to roll on my sleeves

168
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,720
It was upon time to make love

169
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Oh yeah, it was upon time to make love

170
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

171
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
We're gonna round the end of the break

172
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
It's gonna be us

173
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,720
Well they go 20 years

174
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,720
I don't know, I hear that song

175
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,720
And I roll down the window

176
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,720
I think back to those days

177
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Oh, I remember

178
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,720
You're so close, I am the miracle

179
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,720
You're so close, I am the miracle

180
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,720
You're so close, I am the miracle

181
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,720
You're so close, I am the miracle

182
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,720
You're so close, I am the miracle

183
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,740
You're so close, I am the miracle

184
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:25,500
Hey, completely fitting and fun-safe tribute today to board deadly, dead at 79.

185
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,000
He influenced the greats, all the well-known ones, and some of the lesser-known Gary Alexander

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,480
were once upon a time in America, thank you very much, Gary, perfect, perfect for today.

187
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
Okay.

188
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,920
I've been making a study and talking to a lot of the chuckleheads in the UN, EU, in the European

189
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,120
Union, and I'm actually I'm quite amazed that this hasn't popped up in something

190
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:52,000
common-extra blogger sent me, but it's one of those things that it's so huge, it's so big

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,440
that it just gets completely overlooked.

192
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,560
Let me see if I can break it down for you.

193
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,040
Two years ago, approximately, you remember, that there was a referendum for a European Union

194
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,040
constitution.

195
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,960
Of course, when we think of constitution, then we think of the United States constitution and

196
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:15,960
some very basic rights that are put in there, the pursuit of life-librity and the pursuit

197
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,440
of happiness is, of course, one of the main ones, that's really the credo that we live

198
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,240
by in the United States.

199
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,960
So something very similar was created by the European Union.

200
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,280
Let me just try and explain, part of the issues that I personally have and a lot of people

201
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,920
have with the European Union.

202
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,960
The idea here is, after we now have one single currency, which is, of course, the euro,

203
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:47,280
all, we had gilders, we had Deutschmarks, we had Franks, we had Zlotys, we had all kinds

204
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,200
of currencies, these all got folded into one.

205
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:59,880
Technically, in 2000 officially, as currency I believe, in 2002, along with that goes a central

206
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,480
governing body, and this, of course, is what sits in two places, interestingly enough,

207
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,440
in Luxembourg and in Brussels, they alternate back and forth, that's a very, very complicated

208
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
structure.

209
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,240
I have no idea exactly how it works, because you've got the European Commission, you've

210
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,640
got the European Parliament, where we have ministers of the European Parliament.

211
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,200
So what I do know is that, as far as I understand, not a single one of these people was

212
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:32,240
actually voted into office by the people of the member states, of which there now was a 27,

213
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:39,520
which means that a lot of laws are being created and passed centrally in Europe by people

214
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,880
who do not represent the people of Europe.

215
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,720
Now this, of course, is a contentious.

216
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
It's an issue.

217
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,080
A lot of people are really pissed off about it, and I think more, some countries are more aware

218
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,480
of it than others.

219
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:58,240
And in fact, when the European Constitution was presented, countries had a referendum.

220
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,200
Now, if you don't know the referendum is, is basically a vote.

221
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,600
So they put it out to the people, the people go out, they vote, they say yes or no, for whatever

222
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
it is.

223
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,880
And the deal was, if one member states says no, we don't like this Constitution, then it

224
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,800
was back to the drawing board.

225
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,760
You may recall the two countries said no to the European Union Constitution, namely the

226
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:25,240
Netherlands and France or France, as we say in the states, I'm practicing my UK accent,

227
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,480
which meant it got sent back to the drawing board.

228
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,000
And this was a huge disappointment because there was a lot of powers that were created

229
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,480
inside of this document.

230
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:42,640
The most blatant one, the one that really stuck out is that the Constitution could be

231
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:49,600
amended by the people given the power in the Constitution, mainly all these guys and

232
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,880
gals who sit in Europe who make up laws, I believe they'll probably be responsible for

233
00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:00,560
making up 80% of all the laws that pertain across that will be enforced across Europe.

234
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,320
About 20% of the laws, I'm not quite sure which ones, I'm not a lawyer, look, I'm just

235
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,400
like an XDJX VJ guy trying to figure stuff out because I happened to live in the European

236
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,240
Union and I have a finnity with it.

237
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,080
So the people don't generally like that idea and furthermore, I am one of those crazy guys,

238
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,800
we'll go and download the document, we have a website in all, I don't know how many different

239
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,040
languages but it's been about a billion euros a year to translate the European Union

240
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:40,040
website, which you can find at Europa.eu into all languages that are spoken.

241
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,120
And I downloaded it, I took a look at it, let me tell you, it was so complicated to

242
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
read.

243
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,440
It wasn't as it, like the American Constitution is pretty easy, you know, you read through

244
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
it.

245
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,120
It's just a document and you can understand what they're saying and yes, it's open to interpretation

246
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,880
which of course is what we've gone horribly wrong in the United States where lawyers are

247
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,720
re-interpreting the actual meaning of the Constitution.

248
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,560
And boy, when you look at it, it was still a pretty damn good document.

249
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,480
Now, of course, we've had all kinds of things in the States like the Patriot Act, which

250
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,920
took away a lot of liberties and I think we're finally waking up to that and we're going

251
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,880
to have someone new in the White House regardless, I don't know if it's going to change

252
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,120
anything but we know the Bush will get kicked out.

253
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,560
So when this thing went back to the drawing board, that pissed off all these, well, I basically

254
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,080
called it, you know, it's the political class who had wanted to run Europe since the end

255
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
of the Second World War.

256
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,120
You know, they basically said, look, we're never going to let that happen to us again.

257
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,800
We've gone to form a strong front part of that initiative was the United Nations.

258
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,360
We're never ever going to let this happen again.

259
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,200
If we can really bond together as one, Europe, I'd like half a billion people and will

260
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,960
really mean something in the world fair enough.

261
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:53,320
But I think the incestant need and perhaps somewhat greed from bankers and the political

262
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,360
class, I did themselves a bit in really what they've been trying to accomplish, which is

263
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,320
basically run the shit.

264
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
All right.

265
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,080
Now, I'd like things being run on a local level, whether it's a state level or a member

266
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,080
state as countries are now called, that are members of the European Union.

267
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:21,680
And I don't like the idea that these rights will be taken away from local governance.

268
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,200
So they had to figure out a new way to pass all of these, you know, basically pass the

269
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,920
constitution and they didn't want to have to go through the process of a referendum again.

270
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,600
So they came up with the idea, very, very slick.

271
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,640
And this is what's pissing me off because I cannot believe that this slip by again.

272
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
I think it's one of those things.

273
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,080
It's just so huge that no one noticed it.

274
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,800
They came up with something called the Lisbon Treaty.

275
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,960
Now notice that the word constitution is not in the title.

276
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,120
In fact, if you look at the document, which I have also done, and I'll provide some links

277
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,560
in the show notes, it's boring stuff and excuse me, quite honestly, you won't be able

278
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,720
to figure it out.

279
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:08,800
Because the Lisbon Treaty is really, it's an amendment, it's almost like, well, in fact,

280
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,440
it is a legal document.

281
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,320
If you look at it, it refers to the original constitutional document.

282
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,960
But nowhere does it mention the word constitution, because the minute you mention the

283
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,440
word constitution, then the member states almost, in many cases, I think, have to are

284
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,800
obliged to write out a referendum and let the people vote on whether they think it's

285
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,040
a cool idea or not.

286
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:37,240
So they called it the Lisbon Treaty, which, of course, for many people Lisbon is Portugal,

287
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,560
golf, son, sand, the beach.

288
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,240
It sounds kind of friendly.

289
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,920
But really, all that it is, it's just some amendments, some changes.

290
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,000
You know, basically, like, if you read through, it'll say, well, in all these different

291
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,840
articles in the constitutional document, take the word constitution out and call it a

292
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
treaty.

293
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,840
That's one of them.

294
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,680
It's a little nitpicky things.

295
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,080
But honestly, the only way you could read it and understand that is if you put both

296
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,080
documents next to each other, it's almost like a red line, only it's not integrated.

297
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,760
It's not like they give you a word document with the original constitution and then the

298
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,080
Lisbon Treaty merged into it so you can see the actual differences.

299
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
You have to go back and forth.

300
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,680
It's a long-ass document, too.

301
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,160
It's not simple.

302
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,080
And this thing is now coming to a head, because all that the member states have to do is

303
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,200
ratify the treaty.

304
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,800
And if all of the member states ratify the treaty, then it goes into effect as per January

305
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
1, 2009.

306
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:42,400
At that point, the European Union will literally be able to create a single tax code for

307
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,960
all of Europe.

308
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,080
They'll have the high court.

309
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:54,640
Will be a European high court already, law in different member states is decided by

310
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
European law.

311
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,280
But I've been reading up on the subject and looking at it for one reason.

312
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,400
And this is where you Irish guys come in.

313
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,720
And I know we got some chuckleheads there in Ireland.

314
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,680
Luckily, and you'll see why in a moment, luckily, Ireland.

315
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,880
And I'm not quite sure why, but they've done a fantastic job.

316
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,400
Someone was definitely awake while at the wheel.

317
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,080
Ireland is the only member state that is going to hold a referendum about the Lisbon

318
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,320
treaty.

319
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,800
So here's what I've learned.

320
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Lisbon treaty is basically the old constitutional document, but it's gotten a facelift,

321
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,520
a little makeover, mainly taking out the word constitution to be able to kind of push

322
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
it through.

323
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,520
You know, just all the governments, you could just ratify it and then it all be cool

324
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,400
and we'll be good to go.

325
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,720
And this is actually happening this week, many of the member states are going and many

326
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,800
of them have already ratified the documented fact.

327
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,200
And now they're going through the courtesy of explaining it to their individual peoples

328
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,120
in the member states what it means.

329
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:09,320
Well, I found a couple of excerpts that I think we need to discuss here because it's

330
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,520
really, really a frightening document.

331
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,120
Again, we're looking at the merging between this original constitution.

332
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,480
And I didn't even read this in the original constitution because it's kind of purposely

333
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,280
meant to be confusing.

334
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,320
I'm quite sure of that.

335
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,320
It has all the nice, important words and the short sentences up at the front of the deck.

336
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,480
And then in the back, you've got these things like the charter of fundamental rights and

337
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,240
the protocols and all these additional amendments or addendums, I should say, that you

338
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,520
kind of have to read to understand how the laws will be applied.

339
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,320
So I want to read and I put links to this right in the show notes.

340
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,200
It's all from the European Union website.

341
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,480
You can download it, have a look at that for yourself.

342
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,880
And any language you want, by the way, article two is about the right to life.

343
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,840
Now this is obviously a pretty big one.

344
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,360
So here's the, here's the front of the page article two.

345
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,560
Number one, so this two dot one, everyone has the right to life.

346
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:15,080
I'm thinking right on, I'm not a, I'm against the death penalty.

347
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,840
In fact, here's number two, that's article two dot two.

348
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:25,160
No one shall be condemned to the death penalty or executed fantastic.

349
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,360
So I'm like, okay, this is all for me.

350
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:36,200
Now if you dig in a little bit deeper into the, into the charter and into the protocols,

351
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:44,200
article two dot two A deprivation of life, she'll not be regarded as inflicted in

352
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,760
contravention of this article when it results from the use of force,

353
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,400
which is no more than absolutely necessary, and they give three examples.

354
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,960
So deprivation of life, which basically means killing someone will not be

355
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,520
in violation of article two, everyone has the right to life known to be condemned to

356
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:10,000
the death penalty or executed unless it happens in defense of any person from

357
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,080
lawful violence.

358
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:19,680
So if you attack a police officer and they kill you, it will be deemed legal.

359
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:26,000
Number two, in order to affect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person

360
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
lawfully detained.

361
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So if you resist arrest and you try to run away in the European Union, if this

362
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,040
passes, if this treaty is ratified unanimously, and if Ireland approves it and

363
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,800
ratifies it in their referendum, if you try to get away from someone trying to make

364
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:50,720
a lawful arrest, which could be for anything, if they kill you, it will be legal.

365
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,120
And here's my favorite one.

366
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,560
It will not pertain in action, lawfully taken for the purpose of quilling a riot or

367
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,280
insurrection.

368
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:08,640
So basically, if you're protesting and it turns into a riot, and you get shot and

369
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,440
killed, it will be legal for that to happen in the European Union.

370
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,800
I think it's pretty clear what that means.

371
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,600
Hey, it goes on article two, B in the protocols here, referring to protocol number six,

372
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,400
a state, which, of course, means any country in Europe, they make provision in its law

373
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:38,000
for the death penalty, in respect of acts committed in time of war or of imminent threat

374
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,920
to war.

375
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,080
Does that sound familiar?

376
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,920
Does that sound a bit like the wording of the Patriot Act?

377
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,560
So if it's a time of war, if we're actually in war or at war, or if there's an

378
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:57,960
imminent threat of war, I.e. the threat of terror, the war against terror, then you

379
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,920
may be put to death.

380
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:07,440
Any European state may put you to death, basically invoking the death penalty.

381
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,520
You liken it so far, it gets a lot better.

382
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,680
Okay.

383
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,920
So the selling point that the politicians are using right now, right now, telling the

384
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,480
people of Europe, and this is about right to liberty and security.

385
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,800
This is actually article six.

386
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,960
Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.

387
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,200
No one shall be deprived of this liberty, save in the following cases and in accordance

388
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,400
with a procedure prescribed by law, you, I bet you can't wait for this.

389
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,240
Can you now, okay.

390
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,560
So here's some exceptions.

391
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:54,120
The detention of a minor by lawful order for the purpose of educational supervision,

392
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:59,560
or his lawful detention for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority

393
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,960
is authorized.

394
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:11,680
So that means that in Europe, a minor may be detained, lawfully, for educational supervision.

395
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,120
How fricking scary does that sound?

396
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,520
We don't think that your child has been educated properly, Mr. Curry.

397
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,840
We think your child needs some educational supervision.

398
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,160
We're going to take your child away from you.

399
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,720
Here's the big kicker.

400
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:32,280
The lawful detention of persons for the prevention of spreading of infectious diseases,

401
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:41,320
persons of unsound mind, alcoholics, drug addicts, or vagrants, is permissible by European law.

402
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,400
If this is ratified, let's just go through that again, because who are we talking about here?

403
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,160
So you're free, you're completely free to do what you want.

404
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,600
You have liberty, unless, unless,

405
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,360
you are spreading infectious diseases.

406
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,480
Let me think, what group could that pertain to?

407
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,360
Let me think, what's an infectious disease that is spread?

408
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,480
Could it be HIV?

409
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,600
Well, yes, of course.

410
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:20,320
So there's an actual possibility that people with AIDS may be lawfully locked up in the European Union.

411
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,760
If this has been treaty, is ratified and put into effect.

412
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,080
But not just that.

413
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,600
It's persons of unsound mind.

414
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,760
Can be locked up at will of any of the member states of unsound mind.

415
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,160
I think we all pretty much qualify.

416
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,960
We walk around, call on ourselves, chuckle heads.

417
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,520
We're sitting on public transportation with earbuds jam to our ears, laughing and laughing

418
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,960
out loud, having fun.

419
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,640
We might actually drink a little bit or smoke some weed.

420
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,200
Oh, I'm sorry, that's alcoholics and drug addicts.

421
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,920
Of course, real easy to quantify what a drug addict is or an alcoholic is.

422
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,760
And, of course, alcoholism is proven to be an illness.

423
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,680
So if you're ill that way, you can be locked up.

424
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:11,840
Or if you're just a vagrant, let's get the frickin' vagrants off the streets of Europe, shall we?

425
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,920
You can see where I'm getting a little bit worried about what's going on here.

426
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,680
Okay, and here it is, freedom of expression and information.

427
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,720
This is article number 11.

428
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,000
So if you look at point one, of course, it makes a lot of sense.

429
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,960
Everyone has the right to freedom of expressions.

430
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,040
This is what the politicians in Europe will tell you.

431
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,280
This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive an impart information

432
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,440
and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.

433
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,480
This article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television

434
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,120
or cinema enterprises.

435
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,280
It sounds pretty reasonable.

436
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,000
Let's read on into the fine print of this document.

437
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities,

438
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,280
I'm still with that, by the way, I think freedom of expression comes with responsibility.

439
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:09,480
Maybe subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions, or penalties, as prescribed

440
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,520
by law and unnecessary in a democratic society.

441
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:18,240
So in the interest of national security, who will boy where we heard that before, territorial

442
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:26,120
integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection

443
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:33,840
of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing

444
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,120
the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority,

445
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:46,440
the authority and impartiality of the judiciary, you shall have no freedom of expression.

446
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,920
Do I really, I think I should walk through that again.

447
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:55,240
So if it's for the prevention of disorder, well, I'm sorry, you have no freedom of expression.

448
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,080
Well, essentially, I'm doing that right now.

449
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,480
In the interest of national security, well, the man, how big is that one?

450
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,200
That's the whole, that's the Patriot Act of Europe right there.

451
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,800
And I love this, the protection of health or morals.

452
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,000
Wow, the morals of the European Union isn't that just amazing.

453
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,920
It's, you could have freedom of expression, say what you want, except if don't touch our

454
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,200
morals now, please, we've got morals.

455
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,360
We can't exactly describe them in the document anywhere.

456
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,920
We have morals.

457
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:30,400
And for the preventing of the prevention of the disclosure of information received in confidence,

458
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,880
that's the whole whistleblower thing.

459
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,880
That's what it's all about.

460
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,080
If you get confidential information, which could be about your government, your local

461
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,960
government or the European government, you're not free to express that.

462
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,640
This is the shit that drives me crazy.

463
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,280
And it has to stop, luckily, it can stop.

464
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,920
And this is what I love so much about this.

465
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,440
On June 12th, Ireland will hold a referendum.

466
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:05,160
And if they pass the Lisbon Treaty, it goes into full effect, including everything you just

467
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,720
heard me talk about here.

468
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,800
Can you believe that shit?

469
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:17,560
January 1st, 2009, we will effectively be prisoners of the European state, a police

470
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,320
state as far as I'm concerned.

471
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,960
Oh, by the way, they do totally intend on creating the European army, which will also fight

472
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,760
outside of the borders of Europe.

473
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,160
Please pay attention to that.

474
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,240
So my chuckleheads and friends in Ireland.

475
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,840
This is a responsibility that rests upon your shoulders that is just about the largest

476
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,560
I can imagine.

477
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:43,840
It is, oh, please, people, don't bug me while I'm in a rant.

478
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:51,880
It is such an incredible responsibility that rests on your shoulders and not just you,

479
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:57,520
but anyone in the European Union who cares about your freedom, your rights, your right

480
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,520
to life and liberty.

481
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,480
Indeed, the pursuit of happiness, although, you know, apparently there's nothing about

482
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:11,040
happiness in the, in the, in the semi quasi constitution for Europe.

483
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:19,320
If you care about it, you must tell Ireland to vote no, vote no to the Lisbon Treaty because

484
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:28,240
it will lock us up for good, vote no to the treaty, where green, call your friends, put

485
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,360
us up on your weblog, talk about it in your podcast.

486
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,840
I'll have links in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com so that we can all try and stop this

487
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,840
lunacy.

488
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,480
It absolutely has to stop.

489
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,000
Let me play a little bit for you here.

490
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,000
This is not really a speech, but Nigel Farage Faraj, I think, who I don't think is actually

491
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,080
well liked in the UK because he's a member of the UK independent party, which is often

492
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,600
seen as a very kind of weird out there party.

493
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:06,040
He said some amazing things recently about the European Union and about the whole process

494
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:13,960
of ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, which really is just a wolf's in sheep clothing.

495
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,440
It is the constitution that we voted down before.

496
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,640
You can tell there's evil wrong things in this constitution.

497
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,840
It has nothing to do with the way that Europeans feel in general.

498
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,080
I know enough of them, it has to stop.

499
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:33,760
Listen to what Nigel says in the European Parliament, as you stand up and let's

500
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,960
everyone have a piece of his mind.

501
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,320
Hold on, it's coming.

502
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,080
What the European Parliament is engaged in here today with this debate and subsequent vote

503
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:51,720
is nothing less than a massive exercise in the state.

504
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:58,160
A pack of lies are being told and they're being told because you do not want the peoples

505
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,600
of Europe to have the referendum that you promise them.

506
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,320
It is the imposition of the will of the political class upon the citizens.

507
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:12,000
We all know the truth that this been treaty is the same as the EU constitution.

508
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,400
Exactly, the same number of new competencies.

509
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,440
Exactly, the same number of surrenders of visa.

510
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:26,200
It is virtually identical in every regard and it is constitutional because it gives

511
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:34,000
this European Union a full legal personality but was still a gives it the ability to amend

512
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,760
itself in the future without having to refer to more intergovernmental conferences.

513
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:47,000
It gives the EU the ability to legislate over literally every single aspect of our lives.

514
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,120
I'm told though I shouldn't worry because the flag on the anthem have been dropped.

515
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,800
Well, pull the other one, there's a great big flag at the front there.

516
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,080
It's nonsense, it's all part of the lie.

517
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,640
The truth is that you are too chicken to have a referendum.

518
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:09,680
You don't want to hear the voice of the people and now you resort to totalitarian means

519
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,760
to get this treaty through.

520
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,120
We heard Danny Komendit say that those that oppose this treaty are mentally ill.

521
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,720
We heard Mr Schultz say that those of us that objected to the sheer dishonesty of this project

522
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,160
were behaving like Nazis back in the 1930s.

523
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,240
Well, I think the ordinary decent citizens of Europe will make up, will work out for themselves

524
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,440
who the extremists are and I must say I wish the people of Ireland, I wish those

525
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,520
the believe and democracy every success in a couple of months time and I hope they send a large

526
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:50,000
resounding no and I hope the voice of the peoples of Europe will be heard, not that of just you,

527
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,760
the political class and you may be complacent today, but you are increasingly being held

528
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,040
in contempt.

529
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:05,040
Well, that's what I call fightin' wars and he is exactly right, Ireland, please help us out.

530
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:11,920
Vote down this craziness, get rid of it for once and for all, say no in your referendum.

531
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,520
We're counting on you.

532
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,600
Political poetry, words with tears.

533
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:34,160
We're have you been my brother, tell me I be siege, so far gone but not forgotten yet completely out of reach.

534
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:42,880
Your world invaded with vengeance, you left so many to die, you must have been taken by surprise,

535
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,760
is that a tear in your eye?

536
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:59,600
Let me into what has happened, tell me I am poor, your eyes are red and puffy, your hands bleeding with

537
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:09,600
gore, their telephone taps, hidden cameras and units used to spy, these are not utensils of safety.

538
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,520
Is that a tear in your eye?

539
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:23,760
Please talk to me and tell me your silence is frightening, are you fit to make me bed?

540
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,640
You are so different, torn and shattered, lost within your head.

541
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,760
The orders come, now thousands are no more, because of a political lie.

542
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:45,440
No explanations given, just money and freedom is that a tear in your eye.

543
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:58,480
Again, I ask where have you been my brother, tell me of your plight, your eyes show the depths of hell

544
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:07,040
from a ghastly fight, send away to kill the boys and girls alike, not even wanting to try,

545
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:14,480
using their bullets, their guns and more, is that a tear in your eye?

546
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,560
If I could write the world's perfect poem, would that even bring your home?

547
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,320
Would they hear the words spoken from my tongue?

548
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,280
I fear upon deaf ears and the changes would be none.

549
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,800
If I could change the world with my words, bellowed from my heart,

550
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,600
would they notice just enough to make the cleanup start?

551
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:57,040
If I could tell everyone how to be fair, just and true, would that be enough for me to get through to you?

552
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,200
If I yell it from the rooftops, can humanity open its ears and eyes to see?

553
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,640
Would my work reach the weak, the self-centered, and the powers that be?

554
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,600
Will you tell me my dear brother, what have these choices done to you?

555
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Have we lost our freedoms through the actions of a few?

556
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,480
Tell me please, I search so hard for answers trying to break through.

557
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,840
Relax, dear sister, I will tell you, fill you in on what you need to know.

558
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,680
I have been marching and fighting for freedom in a show.

559
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:04,480
It was not invaded with vengeance leaving so many to die. The world was taken by surprise

560
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,000
and that is a tear in my eye.

561
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,440
I will share with you the devastation from the eyes of a child, ready to believe in all that they are told.

562
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,160
Living life so mild, the story I'd complacent just waiting to give in.

563
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,800
These choices have been made for us and by rights, it is a sin.

564
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,960
They lied and said it was for freedom, for others rights but yet.

565
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,680
Where are the changes now moving in, moving out, how easily they forget?

566
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,000
The earth is burnt and barren with nothing left to see.

567
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,200
Who has the right to choose this fate for them, for you, or for me?

568
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:14,960
Through my plight, I closed my eyes and did as I was told. Nothing lives there now.

569
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,120
Just the ground that grows stiff and cold.

570
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:29,920
It is hard to believe in a land. I was so proud to see the evil sore turned to dictators where trusted

571
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,440
fathers for money and power to clear war.

572
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:43,680
You write that world perfect poem. It may be enough to bring the rest home.

573
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,200
Do not fret if they hear the words spoken from your tongue, lose your fear of death

574
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:58,800
and the changes may just come. You can change the world with words,

575
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,800
bellowed from your heart. They could notice just enough to make the cleanup start.

576
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,440
You can show everyone how to be fair, just and true.

577
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,440
That is enough for the important ones to notice you.

578
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:25,440
If you yell it from the rooftops, humanity may open its ears and eyes to see,

579
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,400
reaching the weak, the self-centered, and the powers that be.

580
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,160
Use your words to fight. Make them know this is wrong.

581
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,680
If you never try, then too, your freedoms will be gone.

582
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:51,280
Finally, I tell you, the effort is up to you, my sister, my friend,

583
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:58,240
take the chance, band together, and bring these wars to an end.

584
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,920
Ireland, only nine days left, June 12th,

585
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,600
vote no in the referendum. Vote against the Lisbon Treaty. Vote against this crazy

586
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:14,160
constitution. Do not make the same mistakes America Day.

587
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:46,720
In above us, only sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, earth, and magic. All people, all people,

588
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:55,520
living, living, for today. Magic, there's no country's country's country's country's.

589
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:04,400
It is not hard to do, hard to do, hard to do. Nothing to kill or die for.

590
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:16,080
And no religion, too, too. It's a good idea. Imagine all the people, all the people,

591
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:24,480
living side by side. In peace, peace, peace, peace. You could say, I'm a dreamer.

592
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:33,920
But I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join me.

593
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:42,240
In the world, we'll live as one, two, three, four, the magic of those decisions.

594
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,240
I wonder what you're wondering, what you're wondering, if you can.

595
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,240
No need for great or hungry.

596
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,080
Brother, there's a man.

597
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:03,520
Magic, all the way.

598
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,000
Sure. All the world.

599
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,240
Imagine, if you want to choose, please.

600
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,960
A wise man once said, you can't change the world all in one go. You need to affect change,

601
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,200
bit by bit. I've done my bit. Ireland, the rest is up to you.

602
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:28,880
So while you can, enjoy your freedom and live your life with passion.

603
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:37,120
Another fine, medial presentation. Stick it in your ear.
