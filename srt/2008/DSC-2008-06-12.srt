00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
You're Adam, this is Tony, you know I got a problem with this whole you work for us

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,760
thing.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,120
The problem is with the word work, what government officials actually do work, you know

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,120
I pay all my taxes but it's all for them to afford that big house on the hill, work.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,840
The other day I passed a grow crew working on the highway, one guy working, four guys

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,960
watching, so I don't know we got to come up with something new, like you get paid

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,000
by me, you should work for me, but I can't get on board with this whole you work for us

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,720
because that's just assuming too much Adam, maybe can clear it up on the DSC 768, Capiche.

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,080
Okay, we're a trim it at all off here. I've just passed the Hockham

119
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,200
The OR beacon for those of you who are

120
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,960
Following a lot may be on their Google Maps, of course. I

121
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,840
We got to bring along my other GPS tracker. I want to sucker. I am

122
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,040
All right, so we're just bringing along here. I'm gonna

123
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,640
Have a two seven seven to a few years or some time for people thinking one two nine this will fall over by

124
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,560
27,000 one two nine four. Thank you number seven. I'll be sure all right. That's off to being in hell. Here we go

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,560
Thinking approach number two seven seven. Don't the share of transit

126
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Two seven seven. Don't just here. I'm picking a bridge. Get off the main path. I'm at it

127
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,680
I'm going to have to do a charming one eight two. You have far from Farrox to Rotterdam

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,080
Just release by Farrox radar. I am 10 miles to the west of your field

129
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,120
2300 feet request transit by the overhead. That's more than seven thousand number two seven seven

130
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,160
Delta share

131
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Seven Delta share to come to Q and T school

132
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,240
Seven zero four seven four five miles around to the big and I have a head to Q and H

133
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,840
She's one zero one eight

134
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,800
Seven zero four seven one zero one eight and call you five miles number seven Delta share

135
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,160
But say that actually today the

136
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,960
Conditions are a little bit better up here than I thought there would be we've had a lot of storms

137
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,360
Thunderstorms rain. I can see that there is also

138
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,320
There is some rain in my

139
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,720
In my dream

140
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
As we'll

141
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,880
Probably find out as I start to cross the

142
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,720
In my channel

143
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,720
We need today for

144
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,600
Delta share Charlie number seven six and eight

145
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,960
I think that you know the one of those sounds seem to us. It's just me flying so

146
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
We're going across

147
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,560
The channel to Rotterdam

148
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,280
I have a little bit of business to model so it's the end of the day today

149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Um

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,920
There's a lot of interesting stuff going on as we get over the channel we'll talk about it

151
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,640
And we've got the Irish vendor taking place today

152
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,680
We've got a well and you sponsor of the show that I want to tell you about that

153
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,720
We pretty cool

154
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,680
We're also

155
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,560
Want to follow up and then code next element areas

156
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,800
Which is a whole mother's carry thing all together and that's coming from a guy

157
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,760
Flying solar with two thousand three hundred feet so

158
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,320
Bear with me for a second. I'll leave somebody already on and we'll talk in just a little bit

159
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Number seven don't share them five you mean

160
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,080
I would have never share them all to the big and I would have had two thousand three

161
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,360
Overhead next two thousand three to number seven don't share

162
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,840
I just get a little bit bumpy here actually

163
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,840
Which is to be expected because I can see the storm but I'm ahead

164
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,000
But I'm being said the air will get a little bit more turbulent

165
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
But that's okay no passengers

166
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,160
And

167
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,400
You guys are actually getting the best of all

168
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,400
That was a nice little dip you guys are getting the best ride of all today because

169
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,960
You don't even have to listen to the boring bits when nothing's being said you get the

170
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,720
Monty where there's quite a crosswind blowing right now

171
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:39,640
I'd say well I got about to twenty knots so I'm 24 miles an hour and it's a bit blastery

172
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,880
Okay, I can see

173
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,760
You can hear a few which of course it's a real famous

174
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,480
Or it's

175
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,080
Bunction in the second world war so now I'm gonna set to deathling as my next

176
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,880
Destination here the next to waypoint

177
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,320
To take me cast a little bit left of the storm system which I'm obviously happy about

178
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,080
Looks like we're clear this nothing here in the pattern of course I'm well above pattern traffic

179
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,560
So some of Delta's here over it

180
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:18,040
I'm so nervous here a little dip I'll see it be in the town of seven I've found seven on top on next number seven don't be sure

181
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,440
Okay, so I can see a plane coming

182
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,200
My way he's about 400 feet below me

183
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,520
And

184
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
plenty of clearance there

185
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,800
Don't I just want to make sure I do seven ohs properly now there's a little bit of

186
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,000
If you can hear that beeping that's my

187
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Traffic collision alert system

188
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,720
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to steer a little bit to the left today

189
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,160
It's said are going directly to

190
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,320
Deadly which is my normal waypoint

191
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,480
Because in my path in fact directly in my path

192
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,680
Is

193
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,680
Little bit of the storm system here which is

194
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Delta T and something else

195
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,000
Delta N key

196
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,360
Delta L and we're 0.3

197
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
101 to 01

198
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,860
117

199
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,600
And

200
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Okay

201
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,420
Can you say, hot my favor and shoulders?

202
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:55,700
Watch us know our 277 Delta sheriff, lighting commation service.

203
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:07,100
I can have to do and Tony 1, a two VFR from Faroh again.

204
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,880
I like to stay with you for a little more lighting

205
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,520
service and I'll be passing you with the currently in 2,305 to

206
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,680
number 7 don't share.

207
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,720
I'm going to get a ticket, I just want to go one in the right for the

208
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,720
event after the event.

209
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,080
I want to get a coupon for the event.

210
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,960
1017 and I'll have a short look at the traffic.

211
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,480
Thank you to number 7 don't share.

212
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:35,320
Okay quick scan temperature pressures, everything was good, fuel sufficient, everything's not

213
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
not worried.

214
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
I don't know if I could believe you man, but if you wouldn't be good.

215
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,440
I don't know if the people will serve it, you can hear off and at the

216
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
payment program.

217
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,400
Okay, so don't all the calls we need to make, I'm going to set

218
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,040
mess and I'm going to talk to them in a few minutes, but let's just get the

219
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,040
time from BBC World Service and let's see what the headlights are.

220
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,000
Before we, before we, before we talk to them, let's see what the

221
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
headlights are.

222
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I think we have to debate it in you, Alfa.

223
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Let's hear it.

224
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's for a clock.

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's English in your first language.

226
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You might want to check the news in a different one.

227
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,360
We report global and regional news in 33 languages.

228
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,000
BBC World Service.

229
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,840
This is the BBC in the BBC.

230
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,920
Don't you believe it?

231
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,160
Post here, or for any.

232
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,560
Where are you?

233
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,920
Over here, in the BBC.

234
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
There.

235
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Just a few minutes.

236
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
Here.

237
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Over here.

238
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Over here.

239
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
There.

240
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,920
Over here.

241
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Over here.

242
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
There.

243
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Over here.

244
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
Over here.

245
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
Over here.

246
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,920
Over here.

247
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
Over there.

248
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:46,920
In addition, the US Supreme Court rules of business being held at Guantanamo Bay as the right to challenge their detention under the US Constitution.

249
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
We go live to Washington.

250
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,920
And to Southern Africa, where two leading opposition leaders in the Far West are detained by police.

251
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Here in Britain, a senior opposition politician designed some parliament to mount the challenge before the voters to the government's anti-terror policy.

252
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Oh, that's another big, man.

253
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
What a big shabang.

254
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:16,920
That is this extension of the polling term suspects in the UK for 42 days extended from, I believe, 28 days.

255
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Man, that's been a big deal over here.

256
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,920
Hold on, I'm going to talk to you guys one second.

257
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,920
Let me just, okay.

258
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

259
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,920
I want you to number 277, double share of changing frequency demands to 1,265.

260
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Okay, thank you, bye-bye.

261
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
I love her.

262
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,920
That's the number 277, double share of transit.

263
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,920
Actually, I should have said, quite a profession service.

264
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
That's the number 277, yeah.

265
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,920
That's the number 277, double share of Charlie 182, be a far from Farrowster Rotterdam.

266
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:04,920
Not currently 2,300 feet sponking 7,000, and I'd like to stay with you for fight-in-for-face and service up to the 100, please, number 7, double share.

267
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:34,920

268
00:16:34,920 --> 00:17:04,920

269
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,920
You know, the best account of people's feelings across the world.

270
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:15,920
Well, you listen to news reports and they go around the world and they speak to other European citizens and, of course, the Irish.

271
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,920
You know, they do a very fair and balanced view.

272
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,920
So you really don't know which way it's going to flow.

273
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:25,920
You know, you've got, you know, both start off with someone who's against and they've got a someone who's full and then against and then for.

274
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,920
And so you're really, you know, you really can't tell what's going on or what the sentiment is.

275
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,920
But it's going to be very interesting to think completely new, free Europe.

276
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,920
And the discussion is out there.

277
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,920
The discussion that we've been having.

278
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,920
People saying, hey, you know, this is, uh, this is all fine at Dandy.

279
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,920
But, uh, we didn't get to vote on it.

280
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,920
How come, uh, I just kind of got railroaded through.

281
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,920
So, you know, my stand point on that.

282
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,920
By the way, right now, we're doing about 150 knots to air speed.

283
00:17:53,920 --> 00:18:00,920
A little bit of, uh, a little bit of wind to the, uh, crosswind and headwind.

284
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,920
So, I've got 142 knots ground speed.

285
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,920
And, uh, for those of you who are playing a lot of people with, if you, uh,

286
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,920
find Manston and you, uh, trace to the dawn of Manston.

287
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,920
Uh, you'll see a wind farm, uh, which is pretty funny because, uh,

288
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
I thought of it as wind farm many, many times.

289
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,920
And quite often, uh, they're not turning it off.

290
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,920
So, I'll give you a direct eye in the sky report.

291
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,920
One thing for sure, there's enough wind for those things to be turned in,

292
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,920
some form of electricity that I'm confident of.

293
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,920
All right, come up on the wind farm.

294
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,920
Okay, so I'm just going to count how many,

295
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,920
how many wind bills I see here in the water, which, of course, is, you know,

296
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
heavily debated topic about putting,

297
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,920
many more wind bills in the water to generate power around, uh,

298
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,920
the entire British aisle.

299
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,920
I want two, three, four, five, six, uh,

300
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,920
this is about 12, 24, 24, 25, 35 wind bills here.

301
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,920
And I'm going to tell you how many are actually turning.

302
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,920
Uh, I see one, two, three, four, five, six.

303
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,920
There's one that's not turning.

304
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,920
There's one that seems to be broken.

305
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Uh, that's pretty interesting.

306
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Looks like a blade is ripped off without one.

307
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,920
Now, actually, they all seem to be turning,

308
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,920
and that also shows me kind of where the wind is coming from.

309
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
I have what we call a, uh,

310
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,920
ordering tailwind, which will blow me a little bit off track.

311
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,920
If I don't adjust, I do have the autopilot on,

312
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
but it's not slaved to my GPS,

313
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
so I do have to adjust a couple things manually,

314
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,920
but still it's better to find complete manual.

315
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,920
And, uh, let me just see where we are in respect to Manson.

316
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:47,920
I think I have another, uh, couple more miles to go.

317
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Uh, about to eight more miles until, uh,

318
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
you've been Manson that I don't know where I am.

319
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
Yeah, all of them, they'll see me working,

320
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
except for one that's clearly busted.

321
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,920
Now, two, two roof busted.

322
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Not turning, and actually looked busted.

323
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,920
That can't be cheap.

324
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,920
It is beautiful though, and I'll have to say,

325
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,920
the, uh, and a little bit of vomiting.

326
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Just, uh, coming out of the lamp,

327
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
and now that I'm overseeing, boy,

328
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
it makes all the difference in the world.

329
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,920
And, uh, it's loud to know broken about me.

330
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,920
I couldn't, uh, I could go up to, uh,

331
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,920
you know, 5,500 feet if I wanted to,

332
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
but again, I'm pretty sure with, uh,

333
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
he would do nothing.

334
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Yeah, for the speed, you would just slow me down.

335
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Number 277.

336
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
I'll just share an order for me.

337
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
No, let me have no share.

338
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
I'll run you to an LL by entering.

339
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
About her next, no number 7.

340
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,920
I'll share.

341
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Okay, so that means that, uh,

342
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,920
we've got about, uh, it's not even that long now,

343
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,920
about 7 minutes until we hit the, uh,

344
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
the boundary, which is literally a boundary

345
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,920
and a line drawn on a map.

346
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Uh, uh, that's where, uh,

347
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,920
the United Kingdom flows into either, uh,

348
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,920
uh, Belgian water and airspace.

349
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,920
Uh, or in this case, Dutch airspace.

350
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Uh, and then I'll be, uh,

351
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
handed over to, uh, Amsterdam information

352
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,920
before we, uh, inland,

353
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,920
and then eventually, uh, talk to water dam.

354
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,920
So, uh, a lot of crap going on in the UK, uh,

355
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,920
uh, and it comes and up with Europe about the, uh,

356
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,920
about the place of fuel.

357
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,920
There's, uh, a very important day coming up in, uh,

358
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,920
just a, uh, just a couple weeks,

359
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,920
which is, uh, as of July 1st, across Europe.

360
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,920
And this is, uh, I think pretty much,

361
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
happening in every single country.

362
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
It seems like it was almost a European director.

363
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
I'm not too sure of that.

364
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,920
But certainly some form of agreements were made

365
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,920
where, uh, the, uh, tax on diesel is going to be raised by 3%

366
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,920
that's what the, uh, truck drivers in the UK were, uh,

367
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,920
protesting about and there are people,

368
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,920
protesters, uh, protests, uh, right now in Spain,

369
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
truckers are, uh, blocking, uh,

370
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,920
supply is getting into supermarkets.

371
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
Uh, there was a minor protest in the Netherlands

372
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,920
this morning with another one planned for next week.

373
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
And, uh, this is the big, you know,

374
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,920
this is the big topic of conversation.

375
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,920
And, uh, the European Commission, uh,

376
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
released a statement today, which I, uh,

377
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
printed out abroad with me.

378
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Uh, of course regarding this, uh,

379
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
the situation where people just really can't afford

380
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
the fuel anymore, and they, you know,

381
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
they're all, and everyone's pretty much free

382
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,920
down about, uh, having to, uh, pay even more

383
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,920
with a 3% rise, uh, on the horizon.

384
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,920
So, uh, this is what the protests are about, you know,

385
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,920
not that people can necessarily, you know,

386
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,920
that the place can be brought down, uh,

387
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
well, of course, could be brought down by the old companies,

388
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,920
but, and I've got to just 3% rise by the way,

389
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
turns out, in most countries,

390
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,920
was, uh, installed and agreed upon,

391
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,920
as a carbon emission tax.

392
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,920
But, um, now, and I think that's probably wrong these days

393
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,920
because the diesel engines are much, much cleaner.

394
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,920
But anyway, here's the, um,

395
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
here's the big deal that came out today,

396
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
which was on the, uh, uh,

397
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
European, actually, it's one of the headlines

398
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,920
that, uh, you wrote that.edu,

399
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
if you take a look at it.

400
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,920
But this is from the European Commission,

401
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,920
it was not elected body by the way,

402
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,920
but they hold a lot of weight.

403
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
Uh, the European Commission agrees that

404
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,920
member states, and provide targeted support

405
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,920
when justified to those households

406
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,920
experiencing the most serious impact

407
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,920
of the cost of fuel, while ensuring

408
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,920
measures taken to alleviate the immediate impact

409
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,920
of vital oil prices, our temporary non-destroying,

410
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,920
which is, of course, a tricky little word there,

411
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,920
and do not inhibit longer term adjustment to higher prices.

412
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,920
So, they're taking it seriously,

413
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,920
and that's good news, but now all the individual

414
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,920
member states have to actually do something about it

415
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
and get to it.

416
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,920
And right now, I'd like to play something for you

417
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
from the pod tape using that work.

418
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
I found this, which is pretty appropriate for you today.

419
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,920
It's really proven here's gas money on the Charlie

420
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,920
in the air, on the air.

421
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
Everywhere.

422
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,920
I need some gas money.

423
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:11,920
We'll take some, need you know that

424
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,920
that ain't funny.

425
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,920
We'll like nothing better than to give you a ride

426
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,920
on a year.

427
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,920
But first I'm gonna give me some gas money.

428
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,920
I'll play over Texas.

429
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Me and my van.

430
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,920
From the red river.

431
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,920
To the real red.

432
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,920
Gas prices so high.

433
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,920
I don't know who to think.

434
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,920
But I get to my next gig and may after I'm nearby.

435
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,920
Because I need some gas money.

436
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,920
We'll take some, need you know that ain't funny.

437
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,920
We'll like nothing better than to give you a ride

438
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,920
on a year.

439
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,920
But first I'm gonna give me some gas money.

440
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
Maybe someday.

441
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,920
As I want to find a way.

442
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:28,920
To make the wheels roll without having a bay.

443
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
As I'm a rap chic.

444
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,920
They don't really dig our sea.

445
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:40,920
But till then you spare some change for some gas money.

446
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Because I need some gas money.

447
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:52,920
We'll take some, need you know that ain't funny.

448
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,920
We'll like nothing better than to give you a ride

449
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,920
on a year.

450
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,920
But first I'm gonna give me some gas money.

451
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Well I ran out of gas.

452
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:28,920
I was walking down the road.

453
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,920
This truck driving out came by.

454
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,920
Here in I have it low.

455
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
She was a big old guy.

456
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
But she looked me over.

457
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,920
She said you look pretty good to me.

458
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
But it's as gas or grass.

459
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,920
Nobody rides for free.

460
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,920
And I mean nobody.

461
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,920
It goes on.

462
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,920
Need some gas money.

463
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,920
We'll take some, need you know that.

464
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,920
We'll like nothing better than to give you a ride

465
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,920
on a year.

466
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:18,920
But first I'm gonna give me some gas money.

467
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:24,920
We'll like nothing better than to give you a ride on a year.

468
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:30,920
But first I'm gonna give me some gas money.

469
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:36,920
We'll first I'm gonna give me some gas money.

470
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:42,920
We'll first I'm gonna give me some gas money.

471
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,920
We'll first I'm gonna give me some gas money.

472
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:56,920
And now my favorite moment of the flight.

473
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,920
I would like to climb to 3,400 feet.

474
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
I'll never have no idea.

475
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,920
I'll just call me on a selection report.

476
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,920
I'll reach you next number.

477
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,920
One of my favorite moments of the flight over the channel.

478
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
It's nice and calm like this.

479
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,920
It's a have a nice little pre-rolled tobacco here.

480
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,920
I believe me.

481
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,920
It's only tobacco.

482
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,920
It's one of my vices.

483
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,920
I've got two asteroids on board here.

484
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,920
So what can I tell you?

485
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
I'd love to make use of them.

486
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,920
You know, every once in a while.

487
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
Just get that urge.

488
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
It's kind of cool.

489
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:41,920
The reason I asked to climb up to 3,400 feet is because I see a cloud layer of head.

490
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,920
It looks to be broken, but it was pretty much exactly my altitude.

491
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,920
So I'll just climb up above it and see if we can stay above it for a while.

492
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:55,920
Until we have to start to descend down into as we get ready to coast in into the Netherlands.

493
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:01,920
That, by the way, was a really broken gas money from the cloud safe music network.

494
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,920
I have a couple of minutes here just to tell you briefly about a brand new sponsored action.

495
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
It's sponsored.

496
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,920
This is an awesome device that I want you to take a look at.

497
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,920
It's called the Durobo.

498
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,920
If you've never heard of this thing, the Durobo.

499
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:17,920
If you'd deal with big files on a DuroboStore.com, then you'll really understand what this thing is about.

500
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,920
It's essentially an external hard drive.

501
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,920
It never runs out of space.

502
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,920
It's completely hot, stopable.

503
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,920
You can pull drives out, push drives in.

504
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
It's like a bay.

505
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
It's like a drive bay.

506
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,920
And you can just keep expanding this thing with terabytes and terabytes and data.

507
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
It grows as you grow.

508
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,920
You can put almost any standard ATA.

509
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,920
I think of any standard ATA based drive right into it.

510
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
And it just works.

511
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Now we've got a special deal.

512
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,920
I've already worked with this.

513
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
It goes into this.

514
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,920
Now if you deal with the files like I do, the audio files or video files or 80 photo shop files,

515
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,920
you know what this thing.

516
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
Don't think my work for it.

517
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,920
Just go work at DuroboStore.com.

518
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,920
If you think it's up for you, you want to buy it.

519
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,920
But now until June 30, you can get $50 off of DuroboStore.

520
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,920
It's unit bundled with a Western Digital Green Power 1 terabyte hard drive.

521
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,920
For a 2 terabyte hard drive or a 4 terabyte hard drive.

522
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
And across about 500 bucks, go check it out.

523
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
DuroboStore.com.

524
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,920
It is definitely something you'll enjoy.

525
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:21,920
Now if you please excuse me, I'm going to get the hand off between Manson and Amsterdam information.

526
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,920
And we just climbed up to my intended altitude of 3,400 feet before I call it.

527
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
And so I'll do it all on one go right now.

528
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,920
It's 3,200 feet.

529
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,920
We're climbing at 500 feet.

530
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,920
For a minute.

531
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,920
You can hear that please get a little bit quieter in the cockpit.

532
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,920
I can actually put a little thinner oxygen up here.

533
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,920
And add a little bit of manifold pressure, which basically means more and more fuel on the fire.

534
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,920
Love that.

535
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,920
And here we go.

536
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,920
And number 7 Delta Share is at 3,400 feet.

537
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
And that's the boundary.

538
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,920
You don't find no change frequency to Amsterdam information.

539
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,920
3,6 decimal 6,5.

540
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,920
And down to here in Roger.

541
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,920
Now now I'm going to try to catch my 10 feet on Amsterdam.

542
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
I have a little trick.

543
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
I thank you for the service.

544
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
Number 7 Delta Share.

545
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,920
Here we go.

546
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,920
Okay.

547
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,920
Another advantage of the height here that I just put in is.

548
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,920
I'm going to get better range of the radio because I'm going to quit.

549
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
Don't quit away.

550
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,920
Let me see 42 minutes from a destination or water dam.

551
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
There you go.

552
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
I don't know.

553
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,920
I don't know what the wattage of these transmitters.

554
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,920
But it's, you know, it's something like.

555
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
Gosh.

556
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,920
15 watts, maybe.

557
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,920
I've got the beacon now.

558
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,920
The hotel share.

559
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Delta beacon.

560
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,920
I'm right on track.

561
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
So that's all good.

562
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
Let's give Amsterdam a call.

563
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,920
Amsterdam information.

564
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,920
Number 277 Delta Share.

565
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
Flight Information Service.

566
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,920
Number 277 Delta Share.

567
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
Who to meet up?

568
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,920
Charlie 182 VFR from Farrow to Rotterdam.

569
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,920
Just across the FIR boundary.

570
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,920
And we'll be routing in via hotel share.

571
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Delta 7000, the box.

572
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,920
3,400 feet with even flight information service.

573
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,920
Number 277 Delta Share.

574
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
Number 277 Delta Share.

575
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,920
Number 277 Delta Share.

576
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
Number 277 Delta Share.

577
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
Number 277 Delta Share.

578
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,920
Number 277 Delta Share.

579
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Number 277 Delta Share.

580
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,920
Number 277 Delta Share.

581
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
Please pass your message again.

582
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
Did not read?

583
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,920
Number 279 Delta Share.

584
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
And IDoting.

585
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,920
It's just walks up a thousand.

586
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,920
Just trying to find me now on the radar.

587
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
Here.

588
00:32:49,920 --> 00:33:01,920
I'm sorry, I'm reading YouTube, can you read me?

589
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:16,920
Yes, it is, it's reading 3300 feet per trail, but two now.

590
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Oh my god, you're getting all the easier, you're a 90, that's a moment.

591
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Currently reading 3400 feet at 1017.

592
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
That's correct.

593
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Ready for a Q9, just a little bit of off the screen.

594
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,920
1013, number seven, self-chair.

595
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Well, that doesn't happen very often.

596
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,920
I guess Rado wasn't reading the end then.

597
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
I really had the tune into a voice.

598
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,920
Now, I said I was reading here too.

599
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:50,920
That could mean that in my radio is breaking up, which it wasn't, but just your voice.

600
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,920
I really had the tune into it for a second there.

601
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Anyway.

602
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:03,920
Okay, so we are now officially in, yep, we're officially now in Dutch Airspace, cruise no long,

603
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,920
and everything's all set.

604
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,920
I was going to talk to you just briefly about the codex elementarious.

605
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,920
You should take a look at this.

606
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,920
I put a video on Korea.com.

607
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,920
I didn't get a lot of response about it.

608
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:22,920
The codex is something you need to look at because it's something we're going to be dealing with in Europe.

609
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:30,920
It probably will be harmonized into more by December 2009, and then now talking about making this law in the United States.

610
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:37,920
And if you haven't heard about it, it's basically the law, or it's set up by the World Trade Organization

611
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,920
of all people who would should be responsible for your health.

612
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:48,920
And then going to determine what can be in your hood and what kind of food you can eat and under which conditions are which circumstances.

613
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,920
This is, I'm unusual already in the United Kingdom.

614
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,920
We've heard complaints of people who can't buy certain vitamins and supplements,

615
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,920
and only a pack of stuff may become outlawed.

616
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,920
And what I understand, and this is the thing I want to think about and research and look into,

617
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:11,920
is they may actually start orientating a water again in certain places in the world.

618
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,920
And that is, you know, that's just not what I'm not really too comfortable with.

619
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,920
Hey, you know what, there's some, I'm going to get a little busy here to take them about to fly into some clouds

620
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,920
and not quite sure how far the cloud cover is.

621
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,920
So why just follow along with me as, as we, let me see.

622
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,920
These are, I know, cumulus clouds just a little bit.

623
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,920
Nothing too severe though, but I'll do it a little bit to the left of it.

624
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:47,920
And I do see the tops of the clouds and I can't see the ground, which is part of the visual flying rules.

625
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,920
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take you in all the way into Rotterdam.

626
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,920
And just before we hit Rotterdam, we know I've had a ton of landing.

627
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,920
I got one more sock to play for you.

628
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,920
And, you know, tomorrow, I'll be flying back and I'll be collecting somewhere near the end of the day.

629
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,920
I'll bring you a football party because that is definitely definitely in the cards.

630
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,920
So, uh, hang back, sit tight, fly with me for a little bit.

631
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,920
But, uh, see how we do, uh, with the weather at the conditions here.

632
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,920
If I want to stay above the clouds, which seems to be reasonably okay right now, or if I want to drop down below.

633
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
So, hold on.

634
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,920
No, let's check the BBC World Service while we're at it, shall we add?

635
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
I'm going to let them down.

636
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,920
We don't get off to go.

637
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,920
I remember seven don't share a go.

638
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,920
Yeah, what do you do to hide three don't?

639
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,920
Three don't have six under this seat.

640
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Uh, yeah, that's correct.

641
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
I'm just going over the top of some clouds here.

642
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
Is that okay for you?

643
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
No problem.

644
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,920
Thank you.

645
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,920
Yeah, she's worried about shit.

646
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,920
I'm only, she'll go hide three.

647
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,920
Oh, then I'll hide.

648
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
Okay, hold on.

649
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,920
Let me try and, uh, the means to recycle the whole thing.

650
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,920
We'll try to get it.

651
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,920
Okay.

652
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,920
Okay.

653
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,920
Okay, she sounds a pop.

654
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,920
Oh, it's good to be on radar.

655
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,920
Is that any better of an absurden ambient fall

656
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
than ever seven don't share?

657
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,920
I don't have a deal with her.

658
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,920
Uh, I want to even know what I did.

659
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,920
Okay, that's, uh, that's confirmed and are you receiving altitude?

660
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,920
I'm out of these with altitude, slow, cold green eyes.

661
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,920
No, I don't appreciate that radar.

662
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,920
Probably made in China that I don't know.

663
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,920
I don't mind being involved.

664
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,920
Okay, let me turn it off and then on again with the one more recycle.

665
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,920
Okay, that's that.

666
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,920
That's that.

667
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
That's that.

668
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,920
That's that.

669
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,920
That's that.

670
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,920
We're here.

671
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,920
We have, uh, also here.

672
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,920
Oh, we don't appreciate that.

673
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
Shut up.

674
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,920
On the little side because they're all, but it's all the same.

675
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,920
I hope to see those.

676
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,920
Okay.

677
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,920
We'll remain at all.

678
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,920
And number seven don't share.

679
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,920
Prechates the other station there.

680
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,920
We're back with the, uh, squawk seven zero four seven.

681
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,920
Uh, I'm sending information.

682
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
Number seven don't share.

683
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
Make a second.

684
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,920
We have to be careful.

685
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,920
We have to be careful.

686
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,920
We have to be careful.

687
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
We have to be careful.

688
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,920
This is squawking seven thousand.

689
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,920
Uh, I've got one over here.

690
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,920
She walks through her next step there.

691
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
Three, four.

692
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Thank you.

693
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,920
I'm Dr. Medell, but you're looking now.

694
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
Uh, I'm least keeping your, uh,

695
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,920
uh, identification.

696
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,920
And the fault, but it's only long.

697
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Very cool.

698
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
Okay. Well, I'll have to have that.

699
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
Take a look at them.

700
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,920
I'm sorry.

701
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Is it okay for you, uh, for the information you have at the moment?

702
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,920
On the time.

703
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,920
On the time.

704
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,920
On the, uh, you, you're on the church, uh,

705
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,920
We're meeting you.

706
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,920
On.

707
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,920
Uh, yes, correct.

708
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,920
It is currently 3,600 feet.

709
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,920
Actually, we'd like to descend down to 2,000 feet at this moment.

710
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,920
So you want to follow along.

711
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,920
Number seven don't be sharing.

712
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,920
Okay, down the channel.

713
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,920
I don't understand who problem.

714
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,920
Uh, so the reason why I'm descending now is because, uh,

715
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,920
There's some nice clouds here that, uh,

716
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,920
have been keeping us in a formation.

717
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,920
Uh, which, uh, they're not high enough to be worried about it,

718
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
but they could be a little bumpy,

719
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
and they could be filled with some crap.

720
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,920
So we're just gonna descend.

721
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,920
Lots of beautiful going to these clouds.

722
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,920
Absolutely fantastic.

723
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,920
I don't understand what she's not seeing now.

724
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,920
Okay.

725
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,920
So we're gonna be on runway zero six.

726
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Information fox truck.

727
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,920
The wind is, uh, cross wind from the left a little bit.

728
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,920
Uh, about zero, three zero degrees.

729
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,920
So should be, uh, just fine.

730
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,920
And we've got about 12 minutes until we, uh,

731
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,920
We've got about 12 minutes until we, uh,

732
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,920
We land, uh, this is just, uh,

733
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,920
basically, uh, some kind of strong system that we're flying underneath right now.

734
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
It's a thousand feet.

735
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,920
Yeah, it looks like it's gonna end just before we hit the shore,

736
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,920
which is nice.

737
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,920
And then we have four thousand feet cloud days.

738
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,920
So it's all good.

739
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,920
Actually, only about five, well,

740
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,920
a little choppy here, only about five minutes later.

741
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

742
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,920
Come on, baby.

743
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,920
Keep it together now.

744
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Yeah.

745
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,920
No one's been doing that.

746
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,920
Number seven Delta Sheriff at Hotel.

747
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,920
From a seven Delta Sheriff, virtually,

748
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
for the wiki.

749
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
Whiskey next to number seven Delta Sheriff.

750
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
Right there.

751
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Number seven Delta Sheriff Whiskey.

752
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,920
From a seven Delta Sheriff, we've got one thing called.

753
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,920
Take a next, number seven Delta Sheriff.

754
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,920
Okay, get ready close.

755
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,920
And you can definitely feel the wind here.

756
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,920
It should be exciting.

757
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,920
Number seven Delta Sheriff, take a note.

758
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,920
Number seven Delta, join the left and share the knowledge in a section to a thousand.

759
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,920
Take number two.

760
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,920
Send me one thousand feet number two for zero six, left and number seven Delta Sheriff.

761
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
Okay, fellows, here we go.

762
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,920
Come on, come on.

763
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,920
Okay, up a beautiful exercise again.

764
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,920
It's up a beautiful and equally important wiki.

765
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,920
One thousand five hundred feet for landing.

766
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
A beautiful exercise, we're sure.

767
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
Hold on, I will show you the six same formations.

768
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,920
Hold on.

769
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,920
Hold on.

770
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,920
I will.

771
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,920
Here we go.

772
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,920
Here we go.

773
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,920
Number seven Delta Sheriff, down with zero six.

774
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,920
Number seven Delta Sheriff, number one.

775
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,920
Number seven Delta Sheriff.

776
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,920
We got three greens.

777
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,920
Uh huh.

778
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,920
We got some pretty strong winds up the two states of floods today.

779
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,920
I don't think I'm going to be able to do it.

780
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,920
I don't think I'm going to be able to do it.

781
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,920
I don't think I'm going to be able to do it.

782
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,920
I don't think I'm going to be able to do it.

783
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,920
I don't think I'm going to do it.

784
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,920
I don't think I'm going to do it.

785
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,920
I don't think I'm going to do it.

786
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,920
I don't think I'm going to do it.

787
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,920
I don't think I'm going to do it.

788
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,920
I don't think I'm going to do it.

789
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,920
I don't think I'm going to do it.

790
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,920
I don't think I'm going to do it.

791
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,920
I don't think I'm going to do it.

792
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,920
I don't think I'm going to do it.

793
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,920
I don't think I'm going to do it.

794
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,920
I don't think I'm going to do it.

795
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,920
I don't think I'm going to do it.

796
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,920
I don't think I'm going to do it.

797
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,920
OK.

798
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,920
This is definitely going to be a pretty exciting.

799
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:54,920
OK, I went down.

800
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:02,920
OK, I'm landed now.

801
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,920
OK, I'm going to do it.

802
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,920
I'm going to do it.

803
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,920
OK, let's do it.

804
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,920
Let's do it.

805
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,920
I don't think I'm going to do it.

806
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,920
All right.

807
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,920
That was kind of interesting.

808
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,920
A little bit of bounce there at the end.

809
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,920
That was quite a bit of wind.

810
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,920
They catered big to two.

811
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,280
I don't remember seven notes here.

812
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,320
It's a mixture of lunch and a...

813
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,520
Richard, why don't you take a two-key to get center here?

814
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,320
Okay, don't you remember seven notes here?

815
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,920
Wow, that was a massive, massive gust of wind I got there.

816
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,320
At the very end, wow, that was probably one of the sloppiest landings I've ever done.

817
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:59,120
It's undecflained exactly what happened, but I got a huge gust of wind just as I was touching down.

818
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,520
You know, from here, it's over over here, there's six clear to land.

819
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,720
23, 0, 1, 3, 2, 0.

820
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,920
Yeah, there you go, go, go, go, go.

821
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,520
So I got a huge gust of wind at, you know, about 25 miles an hour.

822
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,120
Just pop me back up, so it's really struggling there.

823
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,120
I get it down, you may put the engine rev up a little bit,

824
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,120
as I adjusted the speed.

825
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,120
Good landing.

826
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,120
That was certainly...

827
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,120
...somewhat exciting.

828
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,120
So, any landing you can walk away from is considered a good landing.

829
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,120
We'll say that was a great one.

830
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:40,120
And with that, I'm going to wind up this edition of the daily course.

831
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,120
Great.

832
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,120
Number 768.

833
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,120
It's an important thing though.

834
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:48,120
Leaving you with Tom Smith and something I thought was better profile for today's show.

835
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,120
I want my flying car.

836
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,120
And you know what?

837
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,120
I'll talk to you guys tomorrow on this for one Friday.

838
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,120
As long as it lasts, enjoy your freedom.

839
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,120
And guys live life with pleasure.

840
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,120
And gals too.

841
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,120
I want my flying car.

842
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:36,120
I want this to be attached to hell out of my garage.

843
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,120
It's my station wagon to a star.

844
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,120
I want my flying car.

845
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,120
They told us we have robots and portable fusion.

846
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,120
So our bodies so we wouldn't stay dead.

847
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,120
But I have to doubt because it didn't come out.

848
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,120
The way Mr. Asam off said.

849
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,120
My coffee bruises self every morning.

850
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,120
My shower seems itself every night.

851
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:09,120
But twice a day I'm caught in a traffic knot.

852
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,120
I'm growing older at every red light.

853
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,120
I want my flying car.

854
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,120
I want my flying car.

855
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,120
You know it just ain't fair.

856
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,120
I want to hit the air.

857
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,120
I want my flying car.

858
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,120
I want my flying car.

859
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:37,120
If I'm making a mistake, I can use my air break or grab a phone line with a spar.

860
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,120
I want my flying car.

861
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,120
No more waiting and hate in the church tail.

862
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,120
Gating when I'm levitate and over the town.

863
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,120
Parking fees wouldn't matter.

864
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,120
I drive a road ladder or a side climb right down.

865
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,120
No barrels of cones or construction.

866
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,120
The zones no blessing radios in the next lane.

867
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:06,120
I'd put on a stethon and make my church kitchen.

868
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:11,120
If I've got a flying car, I can get a girl like James.

869
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:26,120
James, stop this crazy thing.

870
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,120
A thousand miles of the gallon.

871
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,120
It never rides fucking your loud.

872
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,120
When the weather gets nasty, I make a real fasty,

873
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,120
positive climb through the clouds.

874
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:44,120
I never worry about signs of signals.

875
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,120
Those who's gonna take me to jail.

876
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,120
We've what's that sign?

877
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,120
Any someone else flying?

878
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,120
I got pigs on the wing on my tail.

879
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,120
Up in my flying car.

880
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,120
I want my flying car.

881
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:03,120
I stay on the ground when you can drive around.

882
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,120
In a Chevrolet shooting star.

883
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,120
I want my flying car.

884
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:11,120
I want my flying car.

885
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:15,120
Will I don't care how cos I'm ready now?

886
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,120
The future can't be that far.

887
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,120
I want my flying car.

888
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,120
Another fine, medium presentation.

889
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,120
Stick it in your ear.

890
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,120
I want my flying car.
