China

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000

153
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
A revolution never sends you an open

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
A revolution just arrived like the morning

Everybody trying to get the hands on the same green

The banks on the river to the banks of the greedy

00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,600
All under it just taken back by the needy

300
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,400
We come from the country and we come from the city

301

Play us on a record, you can play us on the city

302

All the shit you keep in us

Legalize it, burn them boy's in the base

384
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:44,060
you I am hooked and a conversation came up about why people are listening and checking out the

385
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:50,300
DSC and of course no agenda and the growth of that and I got to tell you you know you every day

387
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:04,140
idea with radio promotions and deal with a lot of stations and you know in that game and definitely

388
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:13,020
one thing that your podcast has that a lot of content out there on on radio lacks is that passion

389
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:18,540
you know and you can hear it I love listening to the music uh love the mashups love love the

390
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:25,260
buck cherry the other day it's great seeing bands like buck cherry on on the DSC and plenty other

okay definitely I'm going to call this guy we'll do that on Monday

419
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:29,100
comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip the member states of the European Union

420
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:34,140
are very own uh European Union savant the one-only comic strip blogger with a financial up

421
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:41,900
yeah I don't we go carry film on here's your EU correspondent csb yes you wrote that

422
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:47,660
against three strikes piracy policy okay so just to let you know what this is about

423
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:54,780
this is something that I believe is already in place in France and the UK has been looking at it

424
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:02,380
and it was just voted down in the uh in the in the European parliament the idea is if you're caught

425
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:08,540
downloading or uploading quote license content I think they're particularly talking about music

426
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:15,100
you get three strikes and after the third strike apparently you can no longer get broadband service

427
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:23,660
anywhere in your country and of course they'll kill your children but as you know I was to late last week

428
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:34,060
to send comment so this week a financial story the European investment bank EID is a EEDU

429
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:42,220
version of word bank and interestingly it is directed by such people as politician

430
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:51,100
Alistair Darling from UK and bankers like Frenchman Pierre Richard and Italian Reiner Mazera

431
00:31:51,660 --> 00:32:00,540
and Brit Tim Stone EID is lending big money on very good conditions to fund so caught private

432
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:08,220
finance initiative schemes including hospitals and privatizations some other investments but

433
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:15,500
these directors at the same time work for banks and financial institutions that actually are doing business

434
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:23,660
with EID that keep it KPMG, Dexia and Le Mans brothers do you realize what it all means

435
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:36,380
you're on the conclusions you yeah yes as if European citizen I must stand and

436
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,820
probe up at my hand over my heart all right yeah yeah man there's all kinds of stuff going on

437
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:46,140
don't think that we're immune over here in Europe to what's going on in the global credit markets

438
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:52,700
Gordon Brown prime minister of the United Kingdom has said this is an amazing thing he said

439
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:59,580
the I guess the bank of England or certainly the government is going to issue bonds

440
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:07,100
to banks in exchange for the shitty ass loans that are out there and make no mistake particularly

441
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:14,620
in this country a lot of shitty loans were made and so basically the taxpayers going to guarantee

442
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:21,100
that money so that the banks can spin up trading again which by the way from an economic standpoint

443
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:26,860
maybe a very good idea I I really am not qualified to say if it's good or not all I do know is that

444
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:32,460
it's pretty risky for us guys the taxpayers because we're now guaranteeing all the the

445
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:38,540
shoddy business that was done and it really gives banks no downside to taking huge risk because

446
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:47,340
we're too big to fail scares me my friends how about you it once was a place a wonderful

447
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,620
wonderful place where listeners to go and sample some of the best music podcasts

448
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:58,380

449
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:05,820
we live in harmony with those interfered ranger jeans and telling lava boots a place where one minute

450
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:11,580
you would hear the calming sounds of the stratavariates and the next gear piercing cords of a

451
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:20,620
prosthetic caster unfortunately on September 27th 2007 that podcast gave its final goodbye

460
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,940
here's one you got a crank i really like you're listening now on your computer through

461
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:43,900
speakers otherwise jams ear buds deep in guess who when the band was saying a shaking

462
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:24,300
when i'm like this before i'm about 10 years time ago

463
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:32,220
when the band was singing shake it all over

464
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:40,060
when the band was singing shake it all over

465
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:45,660
now they give a huge illusion we did the world to see it all rock and build a

466
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,220
roof way too

467
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:54,220
once you don't know how to even know how i just said i got to tell my bitch what in the

468
00:36:54,220 --> 00:37:10,540
now it's not a magic it's not music it's not all right i don't know i think i won't

469
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,380
i'm not just one time before

470
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:19,340
i'm about 10 years ago

471
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:27,180
when the band was singing shake it all over

472
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:36,060
when the band was singing shake it all over

473
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:52,540
now it's not a magic it's not a music

474
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,540
it's not a music

475
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:14,060
when the band was singing shake it all over

476
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:32,460
definitely an entry to the soundtrack of my life to guess who when the band was singing shake

477
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:39,180
all over

478
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,500
by the way if you're looking for some cool tunes to fill up your ipodder and be free player or

479
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,500
you're on these days you're cell phone head on over to emusic.com

483
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:08,300
all right so lots of calls came in about my statements about china and i just want to make

484
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:15,500
something uh really really clear i am not saying that i'm protesting i'm not saying that you should

485
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:21,100
protest i'm not saying you should throw away any products you have that are made in china

486
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:28,620
because you'd probably be going walking around outdoors naked um what i am saying is it seems

487
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:33,020
like there's a huge amount of hypocrisy in people who are protesting the Olympics

488
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,020
being hosted in Beijing in china because of their um violations of human rights which is

489
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:43,660
right there is just a question by itself or they the only ones violating human rights or do we

490
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:50,940
do a fine job ourselves it just depends upon your perspective i guess and uh is

491
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:57,980
dosing a torch really an effective way of um protesting and does anybody really care well

492
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:02,300
according to james are friend here in the UK no one gives a shit james

493
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:08,540
i don't know what this thing again for the protests you're not here and anything there's

494
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:16,940
nobody's interested it's got it all came with it's just all of anything more of a god

495
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,340
it's just being greedy but not being tortured we're not solving a death people protests

496
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:25,580
the people who are being punished in this life and nothing and we're not being punished

497
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:31,740
which is being the extent more and more and more of nothing it's as simple as that and nobody's

498
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:37,820
protesting nobody's interested in what you're saying because it isn't important what's important

499
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:45,180
i'm trying to get to equity in the world simple bye all right get some equity in the world

500
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:52,460
but interesting statement there james and obviously uh excuse me someone does care because

501
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:58,460
we're out trying to douse the Olympic flame as an ineffective pathetic means of of protesting

502
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:05,260
you don't see uh oh Gordon Brown's not going to attend the opening ceremonies oh wow meanwhile

503

504
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:14,060
of products i'm not saying it's good or bad i'm saying that it's just full of shit

505
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,660
it's hypocrisy is what it is please make all of our gadgets and our clothing and all of our

506
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,340
little plasticine things in our toys please make them really really cheap

507
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,140
and we won't say anything about that but we're gonna go and protest the Tibet

508
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:36,300
some country far away yeah i know it's such it's a horrible what's happening horrible what they've

509
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:43,260
done to tywan and others are we any better uh just feels like hypocrisy to me man and where's

510
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:49,100
the where you know what i'm so happy i'm so happy that finally the protest is starting to come

511
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:54,860
in the music and it's not coming in the form of music that i expected it initially to come it's

512
00:41:54,860 --> 00:42:03,180
coming in the form of hip hop it's uh coming in the form of of real urban street art that is being put

513
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:09,260
out there in fact i what i want to do is i want to take you back in time back to the early 80s this

514
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:15,580
is uh it's a mashup by djbc we've played before in the daily source code but the the main theme

515
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:19,660
of the song of course is the message from grandma's to flash you remember i'm actually it's uh

516
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:24,780
i guess it's melly mel who's doing the rap uh and you should have a listen at how we protested

517
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:31,580
in song in the 80s this was about the state of america in the 80s black people and this

518
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:40,380

536
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:29,100

558
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,400
who are normal

559
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,500
he's like a diesem chan新

560
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,040
come down

561
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,240
DJGG sees mesage for the city

562
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:34,260
That's how we did an old school, back in the 80s, mashed up in a nutty package.

563
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,260
Nice.

564
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:40,260
You know, I'm just going through all the Twitter stuff here and seeing where people are

565
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:44,260
saying about being able or not being able to get on to live 365.

566
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,260
I think we've uncovered something here.

567
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,260
I believe it's false advertising.

568
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:55,260
See, the way it works, the highest packages they have available just to sign up online

569
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:01,260
is you get 60 people who are not VIP members, which, of course, means you're signing up and paying for the thing.

570
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,260
60 simultaneously.

571
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,260
And I've never seen it go above 35.

572
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:10,260
It's like 35 seems to be that, no, actually, I have seen it at 40.

573
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,260
But certainly not 60.

574
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:15,260
So there should be room for 20 other people to get on.

575
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,260
And a lot of people are not even seeing the stream as being live at this moment.

576
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:23,260
So I think that we've discovered because we're doing this in a live environment where I'm broadcasting live,

577
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,260
you're feeding back to me live.

578
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,260
I think we've discovered that they're full of shit this company.

579
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:33,260
And I'm going to write them a very stern email.

580
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,260
And I think you should do the same.

581
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,260
There's absolutely no reason why this should be happening.

582
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,260
Other than that they have tricked out their system to not actually deliver what you're paying for,

583
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,260
and that's really offensive.

584
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,260
So let's get all over this shit.

585
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,260
Because I do like the fact that, and of course, who knows of that's true,

586
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:56,260
that they actually give a piece of that $99 a month to artists to pay for license music that is played.

587
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:59,260
Ask at BMI Harry Fox type stuff.

588
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:04,260
So I'm very, very suspicious of what live 365 is doing these days.

589
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,260
All right, back to China for a second.

590
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,260
As I said, a lot of people misunderstanding what I'm saying here.

591
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,260
I'm just opening your eyes and waking you up to what's happening.

592
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,260
I'm not saying we need to protest China at all.

593
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:19,260
And I'm not saying you need to protest it by breaking your iPod.

594
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:24,260
Now we have the French frog from Cupertino, Arnold.

595
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,260
He called in.

596
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:31,260
I believe Arnold still works for Apple, who, of course, makes all of their Shite in China.

597
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:36,260
Hey man, this is the French frog.

598
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,260
So it's in ValleyFrog.com.

599
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:43,260
There it is. I've learned that anyway, I've been catching up on the TSC.

600
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:48,260
I've been listening to 746 the other day.

601
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:54,260
And you mentioned, you know, by cutting, I mean, the whole China, by cutting a concept.

602
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,260
And that's a bullshit.

603
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,260
That is so stupid.

604
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:03,260
I'm sorry, that concept of by cutting products made in China is stupid.

605
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:07,260
Especially if they're made by the company you work for, right?

606
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:12,260
By cutting fathers from country that is not a democracy.

607
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:19,260
Where the citizens do not have access to, you know, to free media.

608
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,260
I cannot know exactly what's going on.

609
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,260
And then why people are cutting those products?

610
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,260
It never works.

611
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:33,260
The Chinese, those one point, whatever, billion Chinese people, they are not fortresses.

612
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:37,260
You know, I mean, they're just people trying to make a buck.

613
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:44,260
They're finally, you know, a lot of them are finally, you know, buying a car for the first time.

614
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:54,260
You know, they're doing what the rest of the developed world has been doing for decades.

615
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:58,260
They're finally, you know, a lot of them finally can feed their family.

616
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:05,260
They're not responsible for the abuses, the horrible abuses of their government.

617
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:10,260
In fact, a lot of them have no fucking idea that it's, that's what's going on.

618
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,260
Yeah, because they're chained to their machines in the factory.

619
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,260
What are you talking about?

620
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:21,260
This is, look, we can't have it both ways.

621
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,260
You know, we can't be protesting just the government.

622
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:28,260
Which, by the way, I think is the biggest cop out in the world when people will say to me, they'll say,

623
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,260
I don't dislike Americans.

624
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,260
I just dislike your president.

625
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,260
I just dislike your leaders.

626
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:39,260
You know, a country gets the government that it deserves.

627
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:45,260
So we voted Bush in, you know, and if you stole the election, we deserve them to steal the election.

628
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,260
We let it happen.

629
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,260
So, you know, come on.

630
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,260
I mean, you can't have it both ways.

631
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:58,260
You can't protest and then at the same time say, well, you know, but we're really hurting the people of the country.

632
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:04,260
You know, the point is to get a message across and the quickest way to get a message to anyone is to hurt them where it really hurts.

633
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,260
Which is usually their pocketbook.

634
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,260
Everything else is futile.

635
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,260
Now, does boycott in the Olympics hurt?

636
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,260
I don't think so.

637
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:17,260
I think that's a, that's a big financial ring right there.

638
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:20,260
The international Olympic committee, my ass.

639
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:24,260
Yeah, you guys are probably sleeping with the bankers as we speak.

640
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:28,260
So, okay, I get your point, I don't know, but I don't think it's correct.

641
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:33,260
You know, how are we supposed to, to let China know that we don't agree with what they're doing?

642
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:36,260
My question is, is it even our place?

643
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,260
Pot-cattle, black, maybe?

644
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,260
I don't know.

645
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,260
They shouldn't be penalized for it.

646
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:53,260
It's impractical anyway, because I defy anybody to live a life without having owning any product or service.

647
00:53:53,260 --> 00:54:02,260
That at some point is made developed, designed, whatever, somewhere in China.

648
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:09,260
Okay, but so just help me understand, I know why are leaders of the, quote, free world boycotting,

649
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,260
because they're not calling it a boycott.

650
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,260
They say, well, I wasn't, you know, Gordon Brown, prime minister of the United Kingdom.

651
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:19,260
I wasn't intending on, I wasn't planning on attending the opening ceremonies anyway.

652
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,260
Now, horseshit, he doesn't want to take the heat.

653
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:28,260
But at the same time, on the back end, they're taking billions of dollars or pounds or euros.

654
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,260
Or I just read this morning that China is now saying that they're going to dump about,

655
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:37,260
I don't know, about a trillion dollars worth of currency, US currency, back into the market,

656
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:43,260
and they're going to exchange that for more stable currencies, like the euro and the Canadian dollar.

657
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:49,260
Here, that people in North America, the Canadian dollar, more stable than the US dollar.

658
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:53,260
We should be protesting outside the White House.

659
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,260
It's impossible.

660
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,260
So, good luck with that.

661
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:05,260
And, you know, this is coming from a guy who tries his best to, you know, buy, meet in the US or meet in France,

662
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:11,260
because in French after all, products, when it's possible.

663
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:15,260
But, you know, I also believe that, you know, it's impossible,

664
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,260
and you like YouTube, you buy products.

665
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:18,260
I'm trying not.

666
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,260
You gotta be realistic.

667
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,260
This is not the way it's done.

668
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:24,260
You know, it's not the way it's going to work.

669
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,260
Anyway, great here.

670
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,260
Hope you win.

671
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,260
Love you.

672
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,260
And, uh, take care.

673
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,260
Well, alright.

674
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,260
So, I don't know.

675
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,260
What doesn't work for me is, of course, calling and complaining saying,

676
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:38,260
I'm wrong and I won't work and not offering any other solution.

677
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:40,260
So, maybe there's two questions here.

678
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:43,260
A is a boycott of products and effective boycott,

679
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:47,260
or does it hurt the people of the country your boycotting too much?

680
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:51,260
And, B, should we even be boycotting other countries?

681
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,260
And, that would be my personal question.

682
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:56,260
Shouldn't we be making our own house a little bit cleaner,

683
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:01,260
get some order in the house, and then lead by example?

684
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,260
I'm thinking it's a good idea.

685
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:11,260
Good evening, I would like to report on the state of our war against American people.

686
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:15,260
We're mounting a sustained campaign,

687
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:18,260
to crack down on every American,

688
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:21,260
and every person of every faith,

689
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,260
and every nation,

690
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,260
and to bring them to justice.

691
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,260
All missions are being executed according to plan,

692
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:33,260
without ruining our provocation.

693
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:37,260
Americans are being swept up in an international drag net.

694
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:42,260
Thousands of FBI agents drawn to trail of other citizens here in a broad.

695
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:46,260
It has everything to do with hate and evil, and murder and prison.

696
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,260
America's strong strong strong strong.

697
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,260
I will agents, we'll run!

698
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:55,260
Why can't you tell me if you don't know what you're doing?

699
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:58,260
We're just in line with you,

700
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,260
but you're really good.

701
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:06,260
You're just trying to explain everything to me,

702
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:36,260
I see a message from the government, like every day, I'll watch it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and

703
00:57:36,260 --> 00:58:06,260
listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen a listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it, and listen to it

704
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:09,260
Connected, stole a post, they control a race and take elections

705
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,260
It's the stolen bones, free-mason kill committing

706
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:14,260
See the dragon, get shitty or in every city

707
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,260
Why don't you know it yet?

708
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,260
Would you know it?

709
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,260
One of the things we don't know

710
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:22,260
Would you stand up for truth?

711
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,260
Oh, would you try and know it's true?

712
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:27,260
We have to be wanted, we don't know

713
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:29,260
All of the things that's wrong

714
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:32,260
Would you stand up for truth?

715
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,260
Oh, would you try and know?

716
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:38,260
No, I show self, who's the one with the most again?

717
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,260
All I love and motherfuckers couldn't stand his name

718
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,260
That even Nick is waving flags like they lost their mind

719
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,260
Everybody got opinions, but don't know the time

720
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,260
Cause I'm never cuz being took

721
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:50,260
It's playing the seat, the oldest trick in the book is making enemies

722
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,260
A phone to evil soul recover, making tourists don't

723
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,260
And take over your freedom, knocking low, eating search

724
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:58,260
And nothing changed, one more fellow people, locked in prison

725
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:01,260
He's big, still beat us, but it seemed we forgetting

726
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:04,260
But I remember, folks, they pimp our hoties, devil's do it

727
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,260
Fuck, truly, honey, ask the all around he's doing

728
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,260
We in the streets, highland trail to the feet

729
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:11,260
Follow, fuck, waving flags, greenies back and sitting knees

730
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:14,260
Boy, oh, blood, money, make these killers ride cold

731
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,260
I'm suspicious, who's five people dying never told

732
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,260
It's all a part of playing God

733
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,260
So you think we need them, we're being asked, cross

734
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,260
Pick away your rights to freedom

735
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,260
Be a witness to the sickness of this trick, take this

736
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,260
Hope you want to stand the time, brother, cause this makes you

737
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:30,260
What can we do, what can we do, what can we do, what can we do

738
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:34,260
What can we do, what can we do, what can we do, what can we do

739
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:39,260
Who can we do, what can we do, what can we do

740
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:47,260
What can we do, what can we do, what can we do, what can we do

741
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:51,200
So, now you asking, why my records always come the same

742
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,240
Keep it reoland facts, what the fuck am I doing, my days, see the gore here

743
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,240
To coming up the Beast, so every story, every word i'm saying

744
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,500
Fuck, beast, see you cook witness to your lumen, naughty

745
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,760
body, count, don't be surprised, these are devil's gonna

746
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,060
I'm talking bad, there where they are, they are

747
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:06,620
You think a couple thousand lies mean shit to killers

748
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:09,220
Niggas spread a God, we the ones ain't no villains

749
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,900
All ready up a world they think to demonize a country

750
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,460
Ain't no terror threatening us approval ratein' slumpin'

751
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,980
So I'ma say it for the record

752
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,980
We don't want that planned

753
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,780
Ain't no one in the country, cook a pawn

754
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,180
Had the hand in, just a way to keep your scary

755
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,300
So you think you need them

756
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,860
Praising through it's why that killer take away your freedom

757
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:27,500
I mean he ever got discovered, but it's not a symptom

758
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,060
Niggas talking loud, but ain't nobody's saying shit

759
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,700
And we can't afford for them at all and I's all in the first

760
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,260
That's why I'm fit to sign out each and every verse

761
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,900
I'll see the call out, whoopin' Harris, make a count

762
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,460
I'll see you in the fifth, each and every session now

763
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:43,100
I don't want a white-stack, burn sheet of public by it

764
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,820
I'll see you to profile and see the media's compliance

765
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:48,460
One's cut for business, either vicious, make a savior

766
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:51,100
Hope you understand the time, but the cut is great

767
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:53,740
Why won't you bear with you?

768
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:57,100
We're all our things, we know what we're just

769
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:01,420
And I want you all, what you try to lead to

770
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:04,540
And if you want it from the slow fall

771
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,140
I'll see the call out, whoopin' Harris, make a count

772
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:10,140
I'll see you to find out, whoopin' Harris, make a count

773
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,980
You try to hold the whole thing

774
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:14,380
What's going to be a very good deal?

775
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:17,180
You're part of things we know

776
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,740
We're just in the thought too

777
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:22,380
I'll see you to try to hide

778
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:25,260
And if you want it from the slow fall

779
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,500
I'll see the call out, whoopin' Harris, make a count

780
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,060
We're just in the thought too

781
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:33,340
We're all we're just in the thought too

782
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:37,420
You can't imagine how much money they spent trying to silence

783
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:40,460
Good people who put their lives on the line

784
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:42,060
The fight for change

785
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,460
Hear that?

786
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,700
Put your life on the line of fight for change

787
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:01,020
What would you do, played earlier this week by Paris?

788
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:04,780
Finally, we got some revolt going in music, man

789
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:08,220
Oh, you got to use the words to get people's attention, of course

790
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:13,100
If you use words like that, you usually can't get yourself played on mainstream

791
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,580
So I'll play this stuff as much as I can

792
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:21,260
Christian Quails says on a tweet here, as far as a country getting the government

793
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,420
They deserve the Chinese, did not elect their leaders

794
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:25,580
Yeah, but that's a cop-out, man

795
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,260
That's the whole point

796
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,260
You get the government you deserve, you have to fight for it

797
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,860
And you know, this is why I like the French, the French, man

798
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:35,980
If they don't like something

799
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,620
And you know, this after I yelled at our no

800
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,940
But if they don't like something, man, they say

801
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:43,580
They tell the government, you know what, then we're just going to burn this shit down

802
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:47,100
And guess what, it works, they get pretty much what they want

803
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:51,260
And everyone seems to be happy, sarcosis got a freaking supermodel girlfriend

804
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,060
Life is good over there

805
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,220
New destination for the Delta Shira

806
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:00,620
Yeah, and I'm not the only one picking up on on this trend

807
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,220
There is a lot more

808
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:05,020
Really good protest music coming out in hip-hop form

809
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:08,220
Hi Adam, this is Justin from Back of the Bus podcast

810
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:12,220
And I'm amazed to hear you play boots, Riley, and Paris

811
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:13,900
On DSC 746

812
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:18,620
We at Back of the Bus have played this song in tons of others from the same vein

813
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:22,140
And we kind of look forward to you playing more political music

814
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:23,900
Great choice, man

815
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,260
If you're ready to have your mind blown wide open

816
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:27,820
Uh-huh

817
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:31,260
You should listen to Jedi mind tricks and shadow business

818
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,940
Or just subscribe to our show

819
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:35,740
And by the way, the best place to download Jedi mind tricks

820
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:37,580
It's from e-music

821
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:38,060
Uh-huh

822
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:42,380
And if you head on over to Jusel Plotz and PW have a link ring at 35 free MP3

823
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,780
So you should probably check that out

824
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,780
This song, Shadow Business

825
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:51,900
I think applies to slavery you were discussing today in 746

826
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:55,500
So if you want to hear more, it's not provoking music

827
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,340
I don't know over to Back of the Bus podcast

828
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:58,540
Great hair, hope you win

829
01:03:58,540 --> 01:03:59,340
Love you

830
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,940
When you were over in American Simo

831
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:03,740
What surprised you the most?

832
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:07,740
I guess what hit me the most is the commission of the factory that the workers were in

833
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:12,700
The factory was surrounded by fans

834
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,020
Uh-huh

835
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,220
On top and on the bottom

836
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:19,100
And they have a gentleman fans around the whole factory

837
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,100
And-and-and the military come out

838
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:23,580
The gate has a uh-huh

839
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:26,460
Has a guard shock where the guard

840
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:27,580
Sypen comes through

841
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:30,460
The welcome movement in and out of the factory

842
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,700
The factory made of um

843
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,700
Panos with tin roof

844
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,700
Um, it's really hot

845
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,700
The temperature over there is

846
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,700
Revolving 90 degree

847
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,700
And inside the factory with a note

848
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,180
It makes you way over there

849
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:54,780
Yeah, it's a concept for every former slavery they call his slave labor

850
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:57,580
But they don't prosecute them because it's how they make tape up

851
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:00,140
When you rockin' that flat shit that's made in China

852
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:02,780
Foggin' that your old child's trying to feed his mama

853
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:05,340
He explores the contamination of the seeds

854
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:08,060
And only 55% of them will get degrees

855
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:10,540
And the women have to try to play cake the boss

856
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:13,100
Because it's sex discrimination in the labor force

857
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,580
The slave masks only let them speak in silent

858
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:18,540
And they suffer from lung disease and not damage

859
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:19,820
14 hours shifts

860
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,180
Seven days a week

861
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:22,620
Two shitty meals a day

862
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,820
Very little sleep

863
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,460
Human life only worth three cents an hour

864
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:29,020
All human rights laws no sets of power

865
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:31,660
What could 400 years in the gray pastus?

866
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:33,660
Only do you prove cleverness to slave

867
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:36,220
Man is like for a living if you live in an hell

868
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:38,380
When the mind is confined to a prison

869
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:41,660
And the lives they devised and the system they failed

870
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:43,420
But I expect the system to fail

871
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,780
Is like for a living if you live in an hell

872
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:49,420
When the mind is confined to a prison and the sound

873
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:52,220
And the lives they devised and the system they failed

874
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:54,300
But I expect the system to fail

875
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,900
Many Chinese workers are forced to sign secret agreements

876
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,500
Known as shadow contracts

877
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,660
Actually for they leave China severely

878
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:04,780
And in some ways you'll legally reach 15 their activities

879
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:06,300
For an American soil

880
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:10,780
Workers are forbidden to participate in any religious or political activity

881
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:15,420
Or to ask for a salary increase or even to fall in love or get married

882
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:18,300
This 1.6 million people locked in jail

883
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,860
They didn't know slave labor force trapped in hell

884
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:24,300
Yeah, they generated over a billion dollars worth of power

885
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,700
And only campaigns, 26 and hours

886
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,340
They make clothes for McDonald's and for Apple Bays

887
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,900
And worker 40, I wish ships and prison factories

888
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:34,540
And while we stood around to pay food, a whack of sakes

889
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,180
They have to work when all's the ridiculous act of names

890
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:39,820
Slave agrees, not illegal, that's a fucking law

891
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:42,380
It's illegal unless it's full conviction of a crime

892
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:45,020
The main objective is to get you in your fucking crime

893
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:47,660
And keep the prison full and not give you a fucking stop

894
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:50,380
But they the real criminal keep a ucafine

895
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:53,180
For petty crime, but they give you to the knot

896
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:55,260
And they know body dance of protection

897
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:56,620
Except the thought you've been copied

898
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:57,820
And human rights is effective

899
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:58,940
It's life worth flipping

900
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:00,220
And if you live in hell

901
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,700
When the mind is confined to a prison

902
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,660
And the lives they devised and the system they failed

903
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,820
But I expect the system to fail

904
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,420
It's life worth flipping

905
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:10,620
And if you live in hell

906
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:12,780
When the mind is confined to a prison

907
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:16,060
And the lives they devised and the system they failed

908
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:18,220
But I expect the system to fail

909
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:21,420
But the sweatshaw situation

910
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:24,940
Kind of conveys different and kind of take advantage

911
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,940
You know, on the people that are poor

912
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,220
And Apple not be a criminal

913
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:30,220
That is an advantage of it

914
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:33,260
The Chinese women make t-shirts and hats

915
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:35,660
And they're going to be gay for you

916
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:39,420
They put us when we get to a bijna

917
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,500
Do you Man these United States

918
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,020
Do you refuse to have the abortion

919
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:48,100
And this好像 has been

920
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:50,780
And define why the prejudice with the fact

921
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:52,760
That the Management of police

922
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,860
TheAMN workers are becoming pregnant

923
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:55,820
and having abortion

924
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:58,780
The human rights workers say is common practice

925
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:02,380
Instead of capturing Chinese lawplod

926
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:05,580
It's 마무�itious

927
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:07,780
The flight doesn't fly inside there.

928
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:08,940
There you go.

929
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:10,620
I love this stuff.

930
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:13,500
If you got more of that, please drop it in my drop.

931
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,980
Drop it in my drop.

932
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:15,980
You're new verb for that.

933
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,820
Drop it.

934
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:20,180
Drop it on me at drop.io slash daily source code.

935
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,420
Fantastic service.

936
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,180
I was trying to invest in those guys.

937
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:24,820
I was looking around seeing what's going on.

938
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:27,740
I love the idea they've come up with.

939
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:30,900
And turns out they already took a series A round of funding.

940
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,340
So that's too bad.

941
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:34,340
And by the way, for, oh no, just one more thing.

942
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:37,620
I do want to point out that I choose my products wisely.

943
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:40,220
And we purchased a French automobile.

944
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,220
Did I know?

945
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,100
There's a no twingo, which twingo.

946
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,620
I'm sure is a fine friend word.

947
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:47,060
Maybe it's a twingo.

948
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,940
It's probably what it is.

949
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:49,940
I don't know what the twin is.

950
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:52,420
It's got like a lawnmower engine in that puppy.

951
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,940
But man, I drove it out to the gas station today.

952
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:56,100
Who?

953
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:59,340
I got to tell you that that's a modern automobile right there.

954
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:00,900
And it's really comfortable.

955
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:05,820
It's almost like sitting in, kind of like a, like a, not a lounge chair, but in a really

956
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:08,940
comfortable garden chair.

957
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:12,540
And it's zippy and it's fast and it's, uh, it warms up really quickly.

958
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,820
I like that when everything is nice and warm and toasty.

959
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:16,100
It's got a great sound system.

960
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:21,940
You can plug in your iPod, plug in an MP3 player, or a USB memory stick, go figure.

961
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:24,340
And those guys got it together.

962
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:27,340
Let's see a couple more Chinese comments.

963
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:34,100
Adam, stress, find a comment on your latest idea to boycott sign up.

964
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:39,860
Which I'm a little, well, and good for, except that pulling out what we already have from

965
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:43,860
sign up, we'd rather point this because the money is already fixed.

966
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:44,860
Hence.

967
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:47,620
All right, as I said, you're confused.

968
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:50,740
I didn't say throw out shit you already have, of course not.

969
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:51,740
Hello, Adam.

970
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:57,100
This is Oscar from the Netherlands, now we're waiting in a trade to default from

971
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,620
Amsterdam Central Station to Denha.

972
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:07,100
Anyway, we've got in your, um, nice little marks about China and the Labour in China.

973
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:15,100
I mean, in real man, not every Chinese person that makes your iPod basically is a kid or

974
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:20,100
some other teen or near baby.

975
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:23,140
Kind of, uh, dude, how do you know that?

976
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:24,460
I'm, I look at my iPod.

977
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:29,180
I'm thinking, uh, there's women shackled to, uh, to machinery.

978
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:31,780
There's kids who are working 18 hours a day.

979
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:32,780
I don't know any better.

980
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:33,780
Do you?

981
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:39,220
I mean, uh, that just assembling your little device, of your lighting.

982
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:46,460
I mean, Chinese also had their other little issues and, yeah, politically, hmm, personally,

983
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:47,460
I don't like it.

984
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,180
But they had some nice little things.

985
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:53,460
I mean, they've got some, uh, that's got some modern stuff there as well.

986
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:59,540
I mean, don't forget, they had some villages that actually made some, uh, climate

987
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:06,300
neutral to, uh, however, because they, uh, recycle fully, uh, uh, you know what it is?

988
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,300
You're right.

989
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,300
I don't have enough information about China.

990
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,100
I'm only going by what I'm being told.

991
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:18,220
So the only thing I do know is that, uh, here in the so-called free West, we're not free.

992
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:22,940
Yeah, maybe we're not exactly chained to a desk or chained to a machine, maybe we're, what,

993
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:28,420
we are working 18 hours for sure my friends were working 18 hours a day.

994
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:29,420
Thank you, email.

995
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:31,180
Thank you, Blackberry.

996
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,180
Thank you, iPhone.

997
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,860
We're definitely working long.

998
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:35,460
We are totally enslaved.

999
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:37,660
Four months out of the year, you're working for the man.

1000
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:42,260
You're working for taxes, which, of course, is something Murray Sabron wants to get rid

1001
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,260
of.

1002
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,260
I should talk to him on Monday.

1003
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:45,260
That's going to be really interesting.

1004
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:48,700
He may be, you can help us get rid of that little minor nuisance.

1005
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,500
But, of course, we're shackled.

1006
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:58,340
We're shackled to our homes by massive debt that was marketed effectively onto us very effectively.

1007
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:00,820
Here in the United Kingdom, oh, man.

1008
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:05,820
The government expressly kept the interest rates really low for decades.

1009
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:08,740
Well, not decades, for decades.

1010
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:13,540
So everyone will go out and start borrowing and no problem, refile, be easy to do baby.

1011
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:14,540
You just watch.

1012
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:15,540
Now we're slaves.

1013
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:18,340
We're slaves to the man in the, in the free West.

1014
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:19,780
That's what we got to be looking at.

1015
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:21,460
That is my advice.

1016
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:22,460
Okay.

1017
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:25,020
Don't waste time protesting China.

1018
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:27,140
Let's get our own house in order first.

1019
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:28,220
It really is.

1020
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:29,780
It really is important.

1021
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:34,740
This is a mashup that I found.

1022
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:36,940
French coincidentally.

1023
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,740
What is it with France today?

1024
01:12:55,020 --> 01:13:25,020
How come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in

1025
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:55,020
a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad taste, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come we' a bad style, how come we're in a bad style, how come, we're in a bad style, how

1026
01:13:55,020 --> 01:14:08,020
Oh, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours

1027
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:55,020
That's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that

1028
01:14:55,020 --> 01:15:25,020
that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love

1029
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:55,020
that is what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I have, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, it's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love , that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, yeah, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that's what I love, that is what I love, that's what I love, that's what

1030
01:15:55,020 --> 01:16:02,020
Hey, a little bit twisted.

1031
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:05,020
I'm sure what I think of it yet.

1032
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:07,020
The master has called it over-dumb.

1033
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,020
It's a five-step, the title of this match.

1034
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:11,020
A radiohead versus Dave Ruback.

1035
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:14,020
Of course, you recognize, take five in there.

1036
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:16,020
I got to think.

1037
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:18,020
I really got to think about France.

1038
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:20,020
Got to consider that.

1039
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:22,020
Wow, man.

1040
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,020
This is an old school Charlie really long.

1041
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:26,020
We're at 75 minutes already.

1042
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:29,020
And it's a two-tea program.

1043
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:33,020
I rushed down during one of the songs downstairs.

1044
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:34,020
Put the kettle on.

1045
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:35,020
Rush back up.

1046
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:37,020
During one of the other songs went back down.

1047
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:39,020
Reheated the water, which was ready to go.

1048
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:41,020
And got me another cup of tea here.

1049
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:43,020
So I can last a little bit longer.

1050
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:46,020
And we still got about 35 people on the live 365,

1051
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:48,020
which seems to be the max.

1052
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:50,020
It's really, really honking me off.

1053
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:54,020
There's a couple things that came in through email that I didn't get to earlier this week.

1054
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:57,020
Mainly because well, yes, of course we got the lady Patricia on,

1055
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:59,020
which was a lot of fun.

1056
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:02,020
This came from Peter Decker.

1057
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:06,020
There's a website called condymusgo.com.

1058
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:11,020
And the mission of this website is essentially that

1059
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:16,020
when she was secretary of, was it defense?

1060
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:19,020
Well, she, I can't remember now.

1061
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:24,020
Anyway, she basically approved waterboarding as a,

1062
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:27,020
quote, enhanced torture technique.

1063
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:31,020
And they're calling for her resignation.

1064
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:33,020
Definitely worth checking out that website.

1065
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,020
Condymusgo.com.

1066
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:37,020
Let me see what else is happening.

1067
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:41,020
Passengers from Southwest are threatening to sue the airline

1068
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:43,020
because they broke their contract with its passengers

1069
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:46,020
by skipping important safety inspections.

1070
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:51,020
Yes, indeed, I believe they deserve to get sued.

1071
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:53,020
Oh, this was a very interesting one.

1072
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,020
This is kind of frightening.

1073
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:55,020
I sent me this.

1074
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:59,020
Shayna, I think, probably emailed this to me.

1075
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:04,020
In Germany, 29 people suffered from lead poisoning.

1076
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:06,020
And the authorities couldn't figure it out

1077
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:09,020
until they did some deeper investigation.

1078
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:13,020
And low and behold, all the people had purchased

1079
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:18,020
and consumed marijuana from the same or a similar source.

1080
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:22,020
And this is a practice that you really got to watch out

1081
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,020
for this shit, man.

1082
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:25,020
I can't believe this.

1083
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:28,020
So what, you know, once you,

1084
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:31,020
once the good gun judge distributed, I guess,

1085
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:36,020
in Germany, apparently, then the kids who are selling it

1086
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:41,020
will mix it up with lead shavings to make it heavier.

1087
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:45,020
I've seen, you know, similar practices like this.

1088
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:49,020
I've seen people throw sand into their bags to make it heavier

1089
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:53,020
and to mix it in with the actual holy herb.

1090
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,020
It's a shitty ass practice.

1091
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:57,020
And you all should be able to look out.

1092
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:00,020
If you don't smoke anything that's in the bottom of the bag,

1093
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:01,020
okay, that's just really bad.

1094
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,020
And one other thing that I realize,

1095
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:05,020
and I'm going to bring this up on no agenda

1096
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:07,020
when I talk with John C. DeVorek.

1097
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:10,020
I don't know if we'll do it today or otherwise obviously tomorrow.

1098
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:13,020
Is the surge in Iraq?

1099
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:14,020
I just wanted to point out,

1100
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,020
if you're looking at, and of course,

1101
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:18,020
we heard the kid from Brooklyn saying that he feels

1102
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,020
we deserve to have live cameras there.

1103
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:21,020
And I absolutely agree,

1104
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:23,020
but even on the footage I'm seeing on the news,

1105
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:25,020
you'll see that there's a new,

1106
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:27,020
there's a new soldier.

1107
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:30,020
And what I'm led to believe

1108
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:33,020
is that the US government has contracted approximately

1109
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:36,020
70,000, 70,000 Iraqis.

1110
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:38,020
Malicious, essentially,

1111
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:40,020
to be a part of the surge.

1112
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,020
And these guys are murderers.

1113
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:45,020
And they're kicking ass and taking names.

1114
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:47,020
And so essentially, you know,

1115
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:49,020
what happened is we didn't up by 30,000,

1116
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:52,020
we uped it by 100,000 by contracting out.

1117
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:55,020
Of course, that's what this entire war is.

1118
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:58,020
It's one big contract outsource.

1119
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:00,020
Ah.

1120
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:03,020
You hear the dog barking downstairs?

1121
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:05,020
We finally got our new fridge delivered.

1122
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:08,020
The guys went on the blank, went Sunday.

1123
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:11,020
We've been with another thing very interesting.

1124
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:13,020
We've been with our refrigerator since Sunday.

1125
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:16,020
The only thing I had is something I have up here in the office,

1126
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,020
which is a portable refrigerator.

1127
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:22,020
Actually, it's a box that can either blow hot or blow cold.

1128
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:24,020
And it can really refrigerate, really, really cold.

1129
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:28,020
And it runs either 12 volt DC or on the AC mains.

1130
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:31,020
And so we've been living out of this little fridge.

1131
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:32,020
And you know what?

1132
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:33,020
It's actually not all that hard.

1133
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:36,020
Once you have the basics, you don't really need all that crap

1134
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:38,020
that you fill up these huge ridges with.

1135
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:39,020
You should try that.

1136
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:42,020
To me, it was astounding and really felt like a revelation.

1137
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:46,020
It's like, I really didn't realize anything.

1138
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,020
All right.

1139
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:51,020
One more song to bring the freight train to a home

1140
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:52,020
for the footballer Friday,

1141
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:54,020
DSC 749.

1142
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:59,020
Don't prove it.

1143
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,020
All right.

1144
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:01,020
All right.

01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:49,020
All right.

1192
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:50,020
All right.

1193
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:51,020

1194
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:52,020

All right.

1213
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:14,020
All all right.

1214
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:15,020
All right.

1215
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:19,020

All right.

1218
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:23,020

1223
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:29,520
All right.

1224
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,120
And that divides me somewhere in my mind

1225
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:38,520
On the borderline of the edge and where I want to learn

1226
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:43,920
I want to learn, I want to learn

1227
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,920
I want to learn, I want to learn

1228
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:55,120
I want to learn, I want to learn

1229
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,320
I want to learn, I want to learn

1230
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:11,320
I want to learn, I want to learn

1231
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,320
The Lord, I walk that

1232
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,320
I shout, the Lord, the Lord

1233
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:23,320
I shout, the Lord, the Lord

1234
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:25,320
I shout, the Lord, the Lord

1235
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,320
I shout, the Lord, the Lord

1236
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,320
I shout, the Lord

1237
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:33,320
I shout, the Lord

1238
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:36,320
I shout, the Lord

1239
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:43,320
I shout, the Lord, the Lord

1240
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,320
I shout, the Lord

1241
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,320
I shout, the Lord

1242
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,320
I shout, the Lord

1243
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:56,320
I shout, the Lord

1244
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,320
I shout, the Lord

1245
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,320
I shout, the Lord

1246
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:05,320
This is just some of about the combination of green day and mark rons and it hits me right between the eyes

1247
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:10,320
He takes all the boxes, makes me feel like he never made me a sprite-day!

1248
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:32,320
He takes all the boxes, he takes all the boxes, makes me feel like he never made me a sprite-day!

1249
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:36,320
Party Ben, you are my hero!

1250
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,320
Alright everybody, how am I? I was singing out loud to that one.

1251
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:46,320
Spryday, my day Tuesday, Wednesday Thursday, full about Friday, I had a final fun phone to read.

1252
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,320
I didn't quite queue it up properly. Well there you go, my friends.

1253
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:54,320
It's been quite a ride today on the footballer Friday, did a source code episode number 749,

1254
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:58,320
three quarters of a thousand coming up on Monday.

1255
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:02,320
I'll see if I can get a very savor on the line. He seems like he's desperate to talk.

1256
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:07,320
That should be pretty interesting. So the final thought of the week, well, what should I say?

1257
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:12,320
I believe that we really need to have a closer look at ourselves about what's wrong in our life.

1258
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,320
It's, well, a lot of it's between your ears.

1259
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:22,320
Quite frankly, a lot of your attitude, a lot of how you look at the world and everything about how you feel is all controllable by you.

1260
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:28,320
So if you continue to live your life with passion, I guarantee you you're going to feel a lot better.

1261
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:33,320
And let's see if we can, uh, kind of our own house and literally do that.

1262
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:38,320
Improve yourself and prove yourself around your friends, your family, do something nice this weekend.

1263
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:42,320
Do something unexpected, turn left instead of right.

1264
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:46,320
I guarantee you you'll feel better for it and you'll be better for it.

1265
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:50,320
And let's not be pointing overseas to everybody. Let's get our own crap together.

1266
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:55,320
No matter where you live, no matter where you're listening to the show, it's up to us.

1267
01:25:55,320 --> 01:26:00,320
The new generation, the Gen X, Gen Y, and Christ, the Gen Z.

1268
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:06,320
They move our Friday and I'm spinal thought of the week.

1269
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:11,320
My friends live your life with passion and enjoy your freedom.

1270
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,320
Another hot show podcast.

1271
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,320
Stick it in your ear.

1272
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,320
Thanks for watching.
