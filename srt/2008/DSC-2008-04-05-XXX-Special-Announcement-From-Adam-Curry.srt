Part of the soundtrack to our lives.

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,760
We're no strangers to love.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,160
Do you know the rules and so do I.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,760
The story begins, while I'm thinking of you.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,360
When you get this wrong, any other guy.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,560
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,360
Got to make you understand that I'm gonna give you up.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,760
We're gonna let you know, we're gonna run around here, we don't do.

15

We're gonna make you cry, we're gonna share you that I'm gonna tell you my love.

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,920
We're gonna let you.

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,360
We know each other, so you're hot to be naked.

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,360
You're too shy to say it's safe, so we won't know what's been wrong.

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:31,360
We know the game I'm gonna play and you do ask me how I feel

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,360
Don't tell me you're too bad to see

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,360
But I know the game you are

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,360

I'm gonna run to you now

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,360
I'm gonna make you cry

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,360

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,360
You'll just have to say

39
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,360
It's like we've all known what's been going on
