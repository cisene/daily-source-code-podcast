It won't get in my way

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Cause now it's a new day

170
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It won't get in my way

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Cause now it's a new day

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It won't get in my way

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Cause now it's a new day

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It won't get in my way

175
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Cause now it's my time to move on

176
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's my time, I've heard what's going wrong

177
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's my time, I've heard what they say

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It won't get in my way

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Cause now it's a new day

180
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's my time, I gotta be strong

181
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's my time, I've heard what they say

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It won't get in my way

183
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Cause now it's a new day

184
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's my time, I gotta be strong

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's my time, I've heard what they say

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It won't get in my way

187
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Cause now it's a new day

188
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's my time, I've heard what they say

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It won't get in my way

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,500
This is the Charley, sir Jersey Todd, who of course should be hearing from later on in the program.

191
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,900
Oh, nice ending there dudes, they're from Ontario, Canada.

192
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:05,000
Hey everybody, it is late, it is completely, in my days, full, full, full, full, full, full,

193
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
bored.

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,900
I'm trying to be upbeat, but I got some kind of disturbing bad news when I got back in the

195
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,900
condo this evening.

196
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,900
My dad's in hospital, and I'm still trying to figure out what's going on.

197
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,900
He, I believe he's being operated on.

198
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Nothing I can do right now, and I didn't feel like going to bed.

199
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,900
So I figured I'd bring you a show.

200
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,900
I'm going to be kind of low key for today.

201
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:41,900
Mainly because I'm a man physically tired, and now obviously just a little bit emotionally tired.

202
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:47,900
However, I do have the bomb diggy show lined up for you, including young polettes.

203
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,900
It's a fun crowd casting with Adam Curry.

204
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,900
I Adam, who are you ready to be stumped?

205
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,900
Yes, he is.

206
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
Bring it up with the young polettes.

207
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:03,900
Hey Adam, this is hit us number 106, and all the tracks this week are from 1983.

208
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,900
So here we go with intro number one.

209
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,900
Biggest.

210
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,900
Yeah.

211
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,900
That's it.

212
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,900
That's it.

213
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,900
Is it, uh, was it, uh, Craig, uh, right next door?

214
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,900
And this is number two.

215
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,900
Okay, that's an easy one.

216
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,900
That's why we Michael Jackson and beat it.

217
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,900
Pretty short isn't least.

218
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,900
And the final one is number three.

219
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:44,900
Uh, uh, must have been love.

220
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,900
Yeah, I'll track from 83, darn.

221
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,900
And time's up.

222
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,900
There we go.

223
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,900
And these are the answers.

224
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
Oh, it's not John Craig.

225
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,900
Robert Craig's number one is Katie Grant.

226
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Oh, this is Grant to know you.

227
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,900
Oh, man.

228
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,900
Oh, man.

229
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:16,900
That takes me back on the soundtrack of my life.

230
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,900
Oh, man.

231
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:24,900
That takes me back on the soundtrack of my life.

232
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,900
And number one, Katie Grant and glad to know you.

233
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,900
And this is answer number two.

234
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,900
I knew I could, this was a run.

235
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,900
And this is Michael Jackson and beat it.

236
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,900
Anyway, hey, let's get started.

237
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,900
Michael Jackson is answer number two.

238
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,900
And this is answer number three in a test number one of six.

239
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,900
This is Roxette.

240
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:39,900
Roxette must have been love as answer number three.

241
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,900
And hit test number one.

242
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,900
Oh, six.

243
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
Okay.

244
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
I really blew the first one.

245
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,900
So what am I, did you do?

246
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,900
Yeah, I screwed up number one.

247
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,900
I'm the answers to this hit test and also the links to iTunes.

248
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,900
And the Instagram.

249
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,900
Online want to be found at hittest.botshow.com.

250
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,900
Thank you for playing Adam.

251
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,900
Everyone else.

252
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,900
Thanks for listening.

253
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,900
And next week, I'll be back for hittest number one of seven.

254
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,900
So until then, take care and bye-bye.

255
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,900
Well, I'm not just thanks for playing, but thank you for putting it together once again.

256
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,900
Yeah, that's bugging me.

257
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,900
I was so convinced that first one was Robert Cray.

258
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,900
Well, let me just listen to that again.

259
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,900
So here we go with intro number one.

260
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,900
Oh, wait a minute.

261
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,900
It does sound a little bit.

262
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,900
You know what?

263
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,900
Let me just try something here.

264
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Did you hear about the lawsuit that Warner Records has put on against seek pod?

265
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,900
My favorite illegal music site?

266
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:50,900
They're seeking like, oh, I think the typical $150,000 fine

267
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:57,900
were statutory compensation per violation.

268
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,900
Which I think would put seek pod considering it's popularity.

269
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,900
I had to probably put them down one or two billion dollars.

270
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Let me just find it here.

271
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,900
Let me see Robert Cray.

272
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,900
I'm pretty sure what's right here.

273
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,900
It is.

274
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,900
Oh, man.

275
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,900
Does that sound the same or what?

276
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,900
Hold on. Let's listen to the listen to the intro.

277
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
There we go.

278
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,900
So hit test number 106.

279
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,900
And all the tracks this week are from 1980.

280
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
Listen to that.

281
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,900
So here we go with intro number one.

282
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Okay.

283
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,900
It's a little different.

284
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
I agree.

285
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,900
You're all mixed.

286
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Yeah.

287
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
That's the big master.

288
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,900
Let's play the song.

289
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
What the hell?

290
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,900
What is what helps you?

291
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
See you, Robert.

292
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,900
And we'll find it right next door.

293
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,900
The ring we were, it sounds empty in the walls

294
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,900
The round midnight heard a shout on three-core One.

295
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,900
And I knew I'd be in the saxophone.

296
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,900
It was because of me.

297
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,900
It's because of me.

298
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:15,900
I heard him shout, who is he, his mum would love

299
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:21,900
He said, the baby don't you lie, I'm here no more

300
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,900
And I'm listening through feastin' walls, silent shame

301
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,900
As he called out my name, I was right next door

302
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:37,900
Because of me, it's because of me

303
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,900
It's because of me, it's because of me

304
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,900
Oh, she was right next door, and I'm for such a strong persuader

305
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:54,900
She was just enough, and I thought my guitar

306
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,900
She's gonna lose a man that really loves her

307
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,900
In the silence, I couldn't hear them written parts

308
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:59,900
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

309
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

310
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:59,580
The Robert Cray Band in probably the worst quality recording I've ever heard of today.

311
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:06,700
Next door on the Davis Horse Code episode number 714 coming to you from the Curry Condu.

312
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,100
I was like going to have another, well it should be a very interesting week depending on what's

313
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:22,220
going on back in the lowlands of course I'll update you on that as soon as I can it's kind of weird

314
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,700
doing the Fubar Friday without having the type of mixer control that I'm used to of course

315
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:35,180
I'm still using the new mobile setup rocker now with Ableton Live with soundbite and thank you very

316
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:41,980
much a lot of people sent in some really good suggestions for MIDI control surfaces that will obviously

317
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:47,820
work with Ableton Live. So what that essentially would do is it would give me faders and a little

318
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:53,820
mixer to work with which is basically virtually controlling the software. It's it's freaky to watch it

319
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,860
because you move a fader up and then you see the faders on the screen move up and down. So some really

320
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:05,340
good suggestions the Jeff Smith actually checked in a suggested Apigee do-et which is indeed a

321
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:11,740
beautiful little device so perfect for portable recording but the the absolute most fascinating

322
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:22,460
best suggestion came from Alan Pine located so actually let me see to see he is located somewhere

323
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:35,180
near Paris and he sent me a link to this thing called I guess it's I'm not sure what the name

324
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:42,540
I 3L I guess is the name of it and what it is it is this is this is phenomenal I'm

325
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,620
definitely gonna put a link in the in the show notes daily source code.com for you to check this out

326
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:54,460
it if you're into this stuff you're gonna freak out it is a controller a MIDI controller that you

327
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:04,700
can load onto your iPhone or iPod Touch and so essentially you have the faders on your iPhone

328
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:11,900
or your iPod Touch and then through Wi-Fi there's some configuration of course you basically need to

329
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,140
you know you basically need to hack your your iPhone or or iPod Touch with the was it the

330
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:24,540
jailbreak software but then remote completely wirelessly you can control these faders just by

331
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:30,700
holding the iPhone in your hand can you believe that how cool is that I mean so I could literally just

332
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,820
be you know kind of like fade and stuff up and down with my left hand while I'm controlling the

333
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:43,180
other stuff with my right hand really really awesome of course unfortunately my iPhone after it

334
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:49,100
took after it took that that bath in the toilet the the the the the most important part for this

335
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:55,740
experiment doesn't work which is the the touch screen but wow it would be great to have something

336
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,260
like that on on the Nokia on the 800 and 10 I wonder if anyone's done any software like that

337
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,300
because that also has a touchscreen and that would be a phenomenal use for that device which of course

338
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:14,540
you can buy at a 15% discount you can't get a cheaper anywhere in the world just go to the show notes

351
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,020
Atlantic Ocean the roughly equal distant between Iceland and Norway they're an autonomous

352
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,140
province of the kingdom of Denmark and in fact other than their legal system foreign affairs and

defense they are completely autonomous from Denmark I never heard of these guys and you know what

Surgery is he Todd, when the man is back, the man is definitely back

388
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,900
I got a great song lined up for you from the Italian variety

389
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:08,900
I was listening to episode number 30 of my sister's podcast

390
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,900
From the hills of Florence, Italy

391
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,900
She hadn't done a show in a long time, but of course I have her show on my on the go channel

392
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,900
So it popped up automatically, and so I listened and it was really it was a great update

393
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,900
In fact, I should put a link in the show notes to give her a little link of

394
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,900
She talked about, well, essentially the past couple months, although we're back to August

395
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,900
So it was real cool because you know, I caught up on a couple things that I knew that she'd been up to because she was actually a vacation with us

396
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,900
When we were in the states member Fire Island

397
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,900
For those of you who've been hanging around the show long enough

398
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:50,900
And she played a song by her husband, so my brother-in-law who is a well-known actor, director, producer, all-round entertainer

399
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,900
And he's a great guy, I really love the guy

400
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:01,900
And he, I've heard him sing before he, when we Patricia and I renewed our vows, or basically got remarried in Italy

401
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,900
A couple years ago, and we had the whole family over, and it was really cool

402
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,900
And Alessandro got up during like after dinner, or best

403
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,900
We were still kind of at the dinner table, but after dinner he got up and he had that we had a piano player there and he started singing

404
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,900
And the guy's just a great entertainer, and he has this classic song called Karina

405
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,900
Which she played on the show, it's not part safe, but I begged her and she gave me a copy, and I think you'll like it a lot

406
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,900
That's coming up right next

407
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,900
Hi Adam, it's Matt from Game's Weasel, coming up on this week's show

409
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,900

410
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:52,900

00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,900
Karina

504
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,900
Karina

505
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,900
Karina

506
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,900
You're an engineer

507
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,500
No one wants to play anyơi

508
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,660
did have to give you an audio comment.

509
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,980
You see, this one just really affected me.

510
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,860
You see, in researching this week's rumor Friday,

511
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,260
I don't know why, but I came across the history

512
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,780
of CBGBs.

513
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,060
Don't know why, I was just surfing around.

514
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,900
And I never really knew this.

515
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,620
If you don't know CBGBs, it was the legendary

516
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,140
legendary club in New York City.

517
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:25,380
And I'm the sign underneath CBGBs outside.

518
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,740
It said, I'm fug.

519
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,340
And I never knew what that stood for until now.

520
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,460
Because I'll just read you this interview with Hilly Crystal.

521
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,420
He says that the question most often asked

522
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,220
to me is, what is CBGB's stand for?

523
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,580
And I reply, it stands for the kind of music

524
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,740
that I intended to have, but not the kind

525
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,380
that we became famous for, country, bluegrass blues.

526
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,340
The next question is always, but what is omfug stand for?

527
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,780
And I say, that's more of what we do.

528
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,300
It means other music for uplifting gourmandizers.

529
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,980
And what is a gourmandizer?

530
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,780
It's a voracious eater, in this case, music.

531
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,700
Man, oh, man, oh, man, if there is ever inspiration

532
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,180
or a mantle for the pot-safe music network to assume,

533
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:15,380
it's that omfug of the music for uplifting gourmandizers.

534
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,380
You see, the listeners of pot-safe music network,

535
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,100
we're some gourmandizers.

536
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,220
I'll tell you that.

537
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,260
I want everything out there.

538
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,100
And the artist that are on the PMN,

539
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,940
man, we got some great, great chefs.

540
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,020
Well, that's just my final thought of the week.

541
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,580
What's yours?

542
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,500
Well, I got all kinds of thoughts running to my brain

543
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,660
right now, Todd.

544
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,500
I'm fug, we're definitely going to keep that in the show.

545
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,700
Hey, thanks to everybody for sending in your demographic

546
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,100
information.

547
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,940
Indeed, I was right.

548
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,380
It seems like we got a bunch of middle-age, middle-class dudes

549
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,980
listen to the show.

550
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,340
And I love you all, no homo.

551
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:58,220
By the way, just to make it clear, homo loves loud, too.

552
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,860
Got no problem with it.

553
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:08,060
This is from South Africa.

554
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,700
This is Derek.

555
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:15,820
Derek, the bandit versus James Nelson, featuring Marseille.

556
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,140
It's on the pot-safe music network.

557
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:18,940
Total chill out.

558
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,500
It's a little uncarturistic for a fubar, but...

559
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,380
I think we can all handle.

560
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,980
During the car, be careful you might start to speed up the end.

561
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:44,140
If you're on the train, be careful.

562
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,060
It might be late in the, a little bit too close to that person next to you.

563
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:01,260
I wish they'd love you.

564
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:05,980
You, while you're making my sense.

565
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,380
And I'll have to give you a hug.

566
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,980
Oh, oh, oh.

567
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,780
I wish they'd love you.

568
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,340
You, while you're making my sense.

569
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:27,820
True, I must have love.

570
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:32,220
True, I must have love.

571
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:36,620
I must have carried all the time.

572
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:41,100
It's on the theory of the way we're trying.

573
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,340
I must have carried all the time.

574
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,740
It's on the theory of the way we're trying.

575
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

576
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,540
I wish they'd love you.

577
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:02,220
Oh, oh, oh.

578
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,620
Just for a day.

579
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:10,780
Just for a day.

580
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:41,500
I wish they'd love you.

581
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:46,060
I wish they'd love you.

582
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:50,860
You, while you're making my sense.

583
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,860
True, I must have love.

584
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:59,020
I must have loved you.

585
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:04,140
You, while you're making my sense.

586
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,540
True, I must have loved you.

587
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:12,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

588
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,300
Just for a day.

589
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,500
I wish they'd love you.

590
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:27,580
Oh, oh, oh.

591
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:32,620
Just for a day.

592
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:37,260
I wish they'd love you.

593
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:47,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

594
00:37:47,260 --> 00:38:08,940
Just for a day.

595
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:17,660
Just for a day.

596
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,900
Just for a day.

597
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,300
Just for a day.

598
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:35,020
Just for a day.

599
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:59,020
Just for a day.

600
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,580
You know what I mean, that's just one of those songs that you can have that on in the car

601
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:08,380
and you turn it up really, really loud and just kind of start to space out and then you

602
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:14,220
forget the speedometer and then before you know it, you're doing 70 clicks.

603
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,820
Nice.

604
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,260
Very, very nice.

605
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,020
Hey man, what would a food bar Friday be without our EU correspondent, huh?

606
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,620
I'm all thank God he checked it.

607
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:35,980
Comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip.

608
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:41,580
Hi, I'm Adam Ferricari, I'm here with your EU correspondent.

609
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:47,660
So, as you know, EU, I say, is going towards recession and in result, well, you know,

610
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:52,300
a whole month as a second CSP, it's not officially a recession.

611
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:56,460
I think there's a, there's a, where the hell is nylon?

612
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,020
I have all these financial questions.

613
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,620
We know that he knows what's going on.

614
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,220
He is the Savank du Finance.

615
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,060
What is the official definition of a recession?

616
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,260
I don't think we're in one yet, but okay, CSP I'll play along with you.

617
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:13,260
Financial situation worldwide is more and more volatile.

618
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,140
So, EU countries are now intensifying efforts, meetings and, you know,

619
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:23,580
behind the scenes stuff, stabilizes the financial situation, but clearly in the

620
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:29,340
so-called Eurozone, it means 15 EU countries with 320 million people

621
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:34,300
that use Euro currency, that is, by the way, now getting stronger and not only against

622
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,300
US dollar, but also British pound.

623
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,820
So, maybe we all should switch back to gold standard as a whole, comments, recommends.

624
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,460
Well, great here you have Adam, what condition are you using?

625
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:52,620
Yeah, yeah, very funny, but of course, it's officially, it's love you,

626
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,340
mean it, great hair, hope you win.

627
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,660
Thank you very much, comics, trip blogger.

628
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,340
Yeah, I know, I just can't, my brain's motion, I can't get into all that stuff.

629
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:11,420
Ron Paul did put out something interesting, I got an email about it, let me, let me find it for you here.

630
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,980
What is it called exactly?

631
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:20,220
It is the four point plan, there you go, it's the comprehensive economic revitalization plan,

632
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:27,260
you can find it at RonPaul2008.com, four points, tax reform, spending reform, monetary policy reform,

633
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:33,180
and regulatory reform, just the highlights, tax reform, reduce the tax burden, eliminate taxes

634
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:37,340
that punish investment and savings, including job killing corporate taxes.

635
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:42,220
Nice, spending reform, eliminate wasteful spending reduce overseas commitments,

636
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:47,340
freeze all non-defense, non-intitinal spending at current levels, monetary policy reform,

637
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:51,900
expand openness at the Federal Reserve and require the Fed to televised its meetings.

638
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:59,340
That's very interesting, because up to now Ron Paul has said, we got to get rid of the Federal

639
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:05,260
Reserve, and I think he's taken a very wise step here by essentially putting in, I would call it a

640
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:12,220
phase-out step, but to require the Federal Reserve, which, by the way, please remember the Federal

641
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:17,980
Reserve, who prints our money, who determines in the U.S., who determines the interest rates is a

642
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:27,020
private commercial organization comprised of commercial banks of which the complete member list is unknown,

643
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:34,780
and it's a black bark, black box, a dark dark hole, so the idea of expanding openness and requiring

644
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:42,220
them to televised their meetings is a great idea, and he says return value to our money.

645
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:48,380
Of course, there's a, on this page, it's all expanded so that you can see exactly what it means

646
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:54,060
by that. So return value to our money legalized gold and silver as a competing currency, man.

647
00:42:54,060 --> 00:43:01,420
This is big, this is a really big idea, subbullet here, level the long-term boom and bust business

648
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:08,940
cycle by passing HR 4683. So there's all these proposed bills or laws, or whatever we could

649
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:16,060
call them, that go along with this, with this four-point plan. So pass HR 4683, which would repeal

650
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:21,020
provisions of the Federal Criminal Code, relating to issuing coins of gold, silver, or other

651
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:27,500
metal for uses current money, and making or possessing likeness of such coins. So I guess indeed

652
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:33,180
it's illegal to pass off, to make your old gold coins. Wouldn't that be cool, though, if you could

653
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:45,180
make your own gold and silver coins? Awesome. And then finally the fourth point is regulatory

654
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:50,300
form, repeal sarbans, oxly regulations that push companies to seek capital outside of U.S.

655
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:57,420
markets, stop restricting community banks from fostering local economic growth. So sarbans, oxly,

656
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:04,220
or sarbox, as it's known, has made the public going public-basic or being a public company,

657
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:09,500
very burdensome, very, very complicated. So damn, comics are blogger. You got me to do it after

658
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:14,220
all. I talked about some finance shit, even though really actually too tired to do it.

659
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:20,940
This song, my friends from the Pod Safe Music Network, is nominated for an Academy Award.

660
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,340
I couldn't be happier, so should you.

661
00:44:50,940 --> 00:45:04,380
And games I've never amount to, more than they're meant, will play themselves out.

662
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:27,180
Take the sink in both, and afford it home, and we still got time. Raise your old

663
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:38,460
full voice, you have a choice, you make it now.

664
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:52,780
Falling slowly, I stand only, I don't try to go back.

665
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:10,380
Just let it take me, I'll never erase me, and I'll pay too much.

666
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:25,020
Will you have suffered enough, and what with yourself is time at U.S.

667
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:41,180
Take the sink in both, and afford it home, and we still got time.

668
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:53,740
Raise your old full voice, you have a choice, you make it now.

669
00:46:53,740 --> 00:47:05,020
Falling slowly, I stand only, I stand only, I don't try to go back.

670
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:39,340
Take the sink in both, and afford it home, and we still got time.

671
00:47:39,900 --> 00:48:02,380
Falling slowly, glad answered, Marquetta Aglova, is from the original version picture soundtrack for

672
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:09,500
the movie once. It's nominated for Best Original Song and nice to have that on the

673
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:15,580
Podsake Music Network. Also has two Grammy nominations. Awesome.

674
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:23,180
Oh man, I am tired and I'm bummering out. You know, my dad and I don't really talk at

675
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:29,340
all. In fact, the last time we talked was that our big family reunion in August and

676
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,580
you know, a year could go by and we don't talk. There's a whole bunch of reasons for that.

677
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:39,900
And now of course, you know, now that things aren't, well, things weren't going too well

678
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:46,300
with them for a while, but you know, now that whatever has happened has happened, I was like,

679
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:50,700
you know, it's like, oh man, all these things we should have been talking about and, you know,

680
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:56,460
you always get a fatalistic view and crap, I don't know, my head's just spinning.

681
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:03,180
Ah, I need to, I need some to cheer me up. Let me see. One more song, which we do that. I figured

682
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:08,300
out by the way, how in Ableton, though, how I can find the time, where at what 48, 49 minutes

683
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:14,140
now, perfect. Just great for a footballer Friday. Here we go. These guys always cheer me up.

684
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,980
Whenever you're kind of down, you can always crank up the fire apes.

685
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:33,500
Still, I'll always wonder why. Oh, I couldn't take it anymore.

686
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,980
Just to know, let's be for a no more.

687
00:49:39,980 --> 00:50:09,980
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

688
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:39,980
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

689
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:47,980
They take it, he's way, I'll take it all too late

690
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:53,980
I've been no take thinking of you, we thought the thought you could be through

691
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:59,980
I've been no take you for days and days, I could only stand up

692
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:23,980
Oh, I can't take it anymore

693
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:29,980
Just to know that we've fallen no more

694
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:37,980
Take it, he's way, I'll take it all too late

695
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:45,980
Take it, he's way, I'll take it all too late

696
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:51,980
I'll take it all too late

697
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:56,980
I think it's that last tone that last chord that just hits me in the right spot

698
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:04,980
Fire Apes, hey Kate, wrap it up the Fubar Friday edition of the Daily Source Code episode number 714

699
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,980
Hey, that's a lot of episodes

700
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:10,980
All right, everybody, tomorrow I'm sure I'll have an update for you

701
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,980
I'll post something on the blog about the situation back in the lowlands

702
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:18,980
I try to get a hold of JCD John Cdvorak

703
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:22,980
We were going to do a Noah gender earlier today

704
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,980
And I did ping him on Skype, but I didn't get back to me

705
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,980
I was much later than I expected

706
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,980
So maybe we'll do one tomorrow morning

707
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,980
Which would be kind of interesting because I'll be here in San Francisco in the condo

708
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,980
And he'll be in the Devorak mansion somewhere in San Francisco

709
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:42,980
And even though it's called Noah gender, I think he wanted to talk about a specific topic

710
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:46,980
He mentioned it to me in passing on the street and I was excited about it

711
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:50,980
Uh, for now, uh, Adam at podshow.com, DailySourceCode.com

712
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:54,980
And, uh, of course, uh, I'd like to say

713
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,980
Love you, mean it's a great hair, hope you win

714
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,980
Live your life with passion

715
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,980
And, of course, enjoy your freedom

716
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,980
Have a great weekend, everybody, bye-bye
