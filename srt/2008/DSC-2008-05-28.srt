They are soft Norfe's 화�ahrens

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and they are pissed off about prices of diesel.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Probably 95% of the energy of diesel in the UK is tax.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And there is another two // tax rate

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We are in the 어려id category.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,920
And i am still about 4 cents

94
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,000
of the euro bills.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,160
With the gold cans

96
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,000
on the horizon

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
theapatalt of diesel

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,560
really really moved up there very fast. It's not even that much of a difference anymore between

99
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,920
diesel and super or we call Euro 95 here, which would be kind of like your basic unleaded.

100
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:45,000
And people are pissed and thank goodness they're doing something about it. I was so happy, so proud.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,600
We've got all these guys going out there with their semis blocking the entire west end of London

102
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,280
and making a stand. I was really, really proud of that. Thank you. And if there's any truckers out there

103
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,240
who were a part of it, please call into the voicemail lines. Those numbers are of course listed

104
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,560
in the show notes, a daily source code.com and also crossposts that are curry.com. I'd love to

105
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,240
hear from you. I was very, I know it fucked everyone's day up, but boy was I happy that that happened.

106
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,640
The French, we've got the fishermen there are also, I think, blocking the harbors.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,360
There's action being taken all over Europe and this is really, really good

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,320
because we need to take a stand no matter what. We can't just sit back anymore. We got to do something

109
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,480
about it, so I wholeheartedly supported and I'm sure that the chuckle heads out there aren't too

110
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,680
well, at least understand that there was no show yesterday, but it was all for a good cause once again.

111
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,840
I really, really am happy and proud of you guys. Let's keep this up. Let's do some more of that, okay?

112
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,120
Adam, do this. Sean, the ad bastard from Dallas.

113
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,360
Yo, I missed it. You respond to kind of a thing that you've been running

114
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,120
right your shows last couple of weeks, specifically addressing the legend regarding

115
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:02,040
I, the common man, is an out there rioting over gas prices, but they are over sports things.

116
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,320
Well, of course that has changed, but this is still pretty actuell, my friend Sean ad, the ad bastard.

117
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,840
And I was thinking about it and I think the real reason is because, you know, I think John the Warach was

118
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:18,440
talking about how people stand up and talk about, you know, getting their own bike lanes,

119
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,040
but you know, all the shit that's going on in the world, nobody's saying anything about this,

120
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,640
because I really think that we don't have the feeling that if we do stand up to do something

121
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:33,080
that's really going to change. You know, you see those bike lanes that are installed that you've

122
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,880
actually accomplished something, but standing up and saying, you know, lower my fucking gas prices,

123
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:46,280
you know, it's a giant oil company that controls that is the cartel in the middle east that controls

124
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:53,480
that. And it just seems almost hopeless, so I just get some light on that folder, grab air

125
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:00,680
couple of you in, yada yada yada, love the shows, keep it going, peace. And I think this, I think

126
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,440
Sean the ad bastard's a common came in before I changed the sign off. I please feel free to do all

127
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,480
your demographics, but don't forget to end up with they work for us. And that's really the point

128
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,040
here, my friend Sean, because yeah, it is kind of hard to stand up to a huge oil company,

129
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:24,280
although some things are happening shell oils, pipelines are being bombed. Some radicals are

130
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,360
blowing that shit up somewhere like Azerbaijan or whatever, I have no idea where it's taking place.

131
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,600
Yes, that's one way, but that time, not a big fan of that. No, I mean, the most obvious way

132
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,960
is to go after the government, because as I said, a lot of the price of your fuel is taxation.

133
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,120
So that is one thing that we can stand up for, and we can say, hey, we need to relieve some

134
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,640
pressure here, lower the fricking tax already. And that's what the Europeans are launching on to.

135
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:56,520
Of course, our severely overtaxed, or just to say, let's be fair, their tax severely, I don't know,

136
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,160
if it's more than it should be. I mean, that's, that's not here, you know, there, but that isn't

137
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,000
easy way to release some of the pressure. And it's going to happen very soon in the United States.

138
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,040
There's no two ways about it, because we have, and it's going to happen with people who drive

139
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,480
professionally first. So it's going to be independent, uh, cab drivers as an example, but certainly

140
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,000
truckers a lot of them are independent. I'm, that trucker Tom, I'm looking at you, man,

141
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,280
tell me about how your business is going. And I, I'm pretty sure trucker Tom is an independent

142
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,120
holier. So, um, you know, let's open up this discussion. Let's help our brothers, because that truly

143
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,520
is the backbone of our country, the backbone of America, certainly is the truckers. They move that

144
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:43,320
shit from east to west and back and forth and south to north. And, um, and I think that, you know,

145
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,920
when it starts to really hurt your livelihood and you see people who are about to go out of business,

146
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,880
that's when change really comes. And that, of course, is a, it's a really, really good thing.

147
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:59,240
Um, I gotta, you know, uh, there's so much to do today. It's unbelievable. Um, and we got some

148
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,440
savants calling in with some rather long, you know, pieces of information, but I think well

149
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,280
worth sharing with y'all. Let me, uh, let me give you a quick one here from, uh, from our buddy,

150
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:20,280
yes, about Ray. Hi Adam, this is Ray from the Netherlands. I must say Adam, I'm really, I'm

151
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,720
really loved at the SC761. This seems that you're getting up at 430 in the morning,

152
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,000
gives you the right vibration to spit fire out of the tailpipe. Although, I truly believe

153
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,440
the morning is the most beautiful part of the day. Never gets easy to get up on an early schedule,

154
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,360
especially in the winter when everything around you is dark and cold. Well, you'll find it out

155
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,000
yourself. By the way, I heard this, how Venus sits a guy from Germany in the SC761, having a

156
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,280
hard time wagging his wheelie, because his inspiration got messed up by your aim put on all that

157
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:03,720
prostate cancer-provation quota. He's been beat to, uh, uh, he's not a story. There's a girl I know

158
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,520
who's been working as a nurse in a hospital in the department where all the men are being

159
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:14,360
helped by all kinds of issues. She told me a little secret, and for anyone, and maybe especially

160
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,200
for my German friend who's having a little trouble keeping his mind on the job. That's a solution

161
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,680
my friend. She told me that for a man it's good to sit when they're having a pee. It's good for

162
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,960
your prostate to shift instead of standing into your thing. Really? So everybody should be sitting

163
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,040
from now on. Okay, Adam? Yeah. Anyway, I really love the soundtracks of your life.

164
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:44,200
I love him. He elasy brothers, damn man, that's so sweet. It's up here. I think it's time to

165
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,640
create a list of your songs and produce a CD or something which I think all the chuckleheads

166
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:57,720
love to buy. When, when we can make a game show out of it, something like 50 pop or an envelope

167
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:05,960
are not maybe the rupee rupee bird. Oh boy, I really have to calm down. I think I found another one

168
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:13,160
that could be on that CD. Well, by Adam, love you. Great hair. I hope you in normal. Just by sexual

169
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:19,640
and maybe your first cops are on. And boys, bad boys. Take care. What you're gonna do? What you're gonna

170
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:25,240
do when you come for you? It's next, next, next, next. It's next. It knows me. Hey,

171
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,120
you gotta learn the words. We usually do course. Good old Ray there. Hey, man, that's a pretty

172
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,320
good idea. I should put that together. I should put together a soundtrack in my life and just

173
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,120
call it that and the soundtrack to my life. That's not bad. I'll look into that for sure. Nice to

174
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,560
hear Mariano Rosenberg, each B&B do, man. I don't know about you Ray, but back in the day,

175
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,520
I was like hot for her. I was in 12 or 13, but it was like, ah, she was, she was the, the shit.

176
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:56,360
Big time. And the, of course, that was when I was living in Amsterdam. Oh, my goodness.

177
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,720
There's this is fantastic. There's a couple of things that came in on the daily source code drop

178
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:08,040
drop.io slash daily source code. Unfortunately, someone also was trying to help us raise our

179
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:16,520
prostate prevention, uh, prostate cancer prevention quota by posting a whole bunch of, uh,

180
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:22,280
yeah, you know, like soft core porn pictures, uh, much appreciated, but, you know,

181
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:28,200
now the whole page is like naked chicks, which is not exactly the idea, um, but by the way,

182
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:35,160
I'm at, uh, I'm at 604 this week, so it is highly appreciated. Let's talk about, uh, nuclear

183
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,160
energy, the nuclear energy that I believe just may be the way forward. Screw CO2 emissions,

184
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,480
get your new clear right now. Hey, Adam, it's been on desert. I was just listening to a

185
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:54,680
DSE. 761, you're talking about nuclear waste. It's actually, um, far as I know there's two

186
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:01,800
basic kinds of nuclear waste. The waste fuel expended fuel, which that can be recycled and, uh,

187
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,520
every enriched that's kind of difference between a fusion reactor and a fusion reactor reaction,

188
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,360
you can, uh, the one can help you make the other, uh, so you need a certain amount of both.

189
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:20,520
But the other kind of waste, all the old pumps, any, anything you've taken out of, uh, um, most, uh,

190
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:27,080
irradiated part of the plant when you have to replace parts or renew parts, that stuff, you know,

191
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,960
is really heavily radioactive. That stuff, you have to store that stuff, you're putting in,

192
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,200
um, underground involved, and it's going to be radioactive for 10,000 years and all that.

193
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,840
That's a part that's really hard to control. Then what they're worried about, when you do put it

194
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:48,920
underground, is if there's any groundwater, if there's any intrusion and the stuff starts creeping around,

195
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,840
in the groundwater, it's making the water radioactive. Yeah, you can't control it once it's released

196
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,320
into the ground. So long-term storage of the material is what the difficulty is.

197
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,400
Just thought I'd give you a little information, probably somebody really knows about what

198
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,160
I'll call in until you're the real deal. Yeah, a little on it. Otherwise, see you later. Bye.

199
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:16,440
No. Yeah, um, that's kind of where I'm at right now, you know, what's going on with the,

200
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,560
with the nuclear waste, and, you know, that's basically the only thing left I believe,

201
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,640
because there's a lot of changes taken place, a lot of new technology, a lot of new thinking,

202
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,600
a lot of experiences, well, when it comes to this type of energy, of energy source.

203
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,880
And, um, and I think that, you know, we just need to keep on exploring it, because, you know,

204
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,240
so, okay, we have a waste problem. You know, there's also the CDC's Center for Disease Control,

205
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,240
or somewhere I'm sure, spread around the country. We never talk about it. I'm sure there's tons of

206
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,280
viruses, which if it got into the air, would kill us all instantaneously. They certainly make movies

207
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,040
about that as well. You know, and that way, yet we're not afraid of those places being bombed,

208
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,400
or, you know, lack of security, which I'm sure happens from time to time. You know, and by the way,

209
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,520
life just ain't freaking safe. You know, you have more chance of getting killed in your

210
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,960
automobile than I have been crashing my plane. That's one statistically speaking. God forbid,

211
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,680
I'm flying tomorrow. It's raining cats and dogs as we speak. But, you know, compared to, you know,

212
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:24,920
what can happen with a nuclear disaster? Did I say a nuclear? I said nuclear, nuclear, nuclear.

213
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,640
It's so hard to say. But my tongue doesn't want to do it. No wonder George Bush has tough time.

214
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,720
Nuclear. Now, of course, you had some, some doubts about your analysis there. Luckily,

215
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,960
we have a sub-on, and that's what I love so much about this show. Automic Rod Jackson

216
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,840
to talk about just that very point. And then what can we do with this waste? Can we recycle it?

217
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:52,520
Turns out? Yes. Adam Atomic Rod, I'm here regarding your question on episode 7-6-1

218
00:17:52,520 --> 00:18:01,400
about what can we do with recycled nuclear waste. It is mostly used fuel. About 95% can be returned

219
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,480
to the reactor for fuel. The other 5% consists of the iable products like Stanteam, CZM,

220
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,320
Rucinium, and Rodeum, which can all be used for valuable industrial processes. Anyway,

221
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:20,120
just thought I'd answer your question. And I work for you as a member of the United States Navy.

222
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,400
Hello, yeah. Hell yeah. There you go. That's your government at work. And he does work for us.

223
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,440
And thank you very much Atomic Rod. I really appreciate it. Of course, he spent a large portion of

224
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,720
his life aboard nuclear submarines. And he seems to be okay. I don't think I can't see if he's

225
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:44,360
going in the dark, but he sounds all right. And yeah, that's another one of those little

226
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,960
things. How many of those? We got floating around, which I guess could potentially contaminate

227
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,320
the entire ocean. No one really talks about that much anymore either. Even though we've had

228
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:02,680
some maybe close calls. I think of the Russians. Didn't I read somewhere that a U.K. Atomic

229
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:11,400
sub hit a rock? Oh, boy. And then it all blew people so I could hit a rock. No outrage over

230
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,360
nuclear waste and contamination. So let's keep educating ourselves. I mean, obviously, I don't know

231
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,400
everything. I'm just a little boy here with this little Mr. microphone doing my thing.

232
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,840
Rodeum out the voice mail lines, listen to the savons. And from time to time, they're pissed off.

233
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,680
And he has another perfect example, because he's back ladies and gentlemen. Let's

234
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:39,720
have a word with the nylon. Spreading the news with the smile on where the world writes.

235
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:46,760
We go whole light. Let's listen to the nylon. Yeah, welcome back to New Yorker from London.

236
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,360
Yeah, I'm it's the nylon. I've got three things to pose to you today. Well, if you know,

237
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,960
by the way, nylon, when you call in, you've been absent for a couple of weeks. Would you mind

238
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,800
just saying, sorry. I haven't heard from me. I've been busy. Here's what's going on. You know,

239
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,360
we wouldn't mind if you told us what the hell you do by now. You know, you hide behind your acronym,

240
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,200
but who are you, my friend? Are you a truce of on tour, an agent from foreign countries?

241
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,880
So, she's still going all in about the EU and snooping. And I have to bring to your attention

242
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,920
that you overlook the story, purposely, otherwise in the 16th of April on the BBC, another UK media,

243
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,040
where it's found that BP, British telecom, your partner, your beloved partner, Gavin, Ben,

244
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:36,440
the whole crowd, was snooping on about 16,000 internet users without shared knowledge.

245
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,760
Oh, I know what this is about. And by the way, I think I've blogged about this. And I also think

246
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,600
I talked about it in the show, but you might not have heard every single one nylon.

247
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:51,640
If this is that company form, Papa Hotel Oscar Romeo Mike, which is working with not just BT,

248
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,920
but the three largest broadband providers. And I believe the same company or subsidiary,

249
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:04,120
or one, just like it, is now also launching in the US. And what this company does is they,

250
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,600
they sit at the ISP level. So, all of your web traffic is flowing through their, essentially,

251
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:15,320
through their, to their kind of like a proxy server, if you will. And when, you know, it's

252
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:22,280
was tracking your surfing behavior. And when relevant, it will inject relevant advertising.

253
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,000
Now, at first, I thought it was just doing this on any damage, which, of course, would be very

254
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,600
wrong. Maybe even more wrong than all of this is at the time. Turns out you have to be, you know,

255
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,800
the advertiser sign up. But, of course, the ISP is also going to a piece of this. Now,

256
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,760
you kind of go rising at a snooping. I think it's not fair. Because,

257
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:50,120
well, let's say, let me put it this way. I'm against what's going on here for damn sure. I don't

258
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,720
like it one bit. Mainly for privacy concerns. Also, you know, the whole advertising thing,

259
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,600
it just seems a little unclear to me. And the biggest defense, I feel, you know, this is a service.

260
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,560
Okay, if you want to take advantage of it, you know, it's built. I thought to truly do believe that

261
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,800
they're trying to give people relevant advertising. So, you know, this kind of snooping goes on in

262
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,920
different ways as you snooping as you call it goes on in different ways. Like double-click, you know,

263
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,640
there's all kinds of it. And what is it to code from AOL? Of course, the first time it's being done

264
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:27,480
at an ISP level. And VT has been very clear about it. They do the test. And I think they did mess up

265
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,000
by not telling their customers. But they weren't snooping, you know, now you're just kind of

266
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,600
blowing it all out of proportion. And I think that they've learned their lesson by the way. But let's

267
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,240
hear what else you have to say about this nylon. 16,000. They say it was just a test of pilot,

268
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:47,880
a glimpse without the acknowledge to snoopers you're in bed with. So, I think I would like to know

269
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,880
and to rest your audience because I wouldn't know if I went to VT bought Pod Show.

270
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:59,880
Well, they snooping on me when I went to VT Pod Show. So, can you tell us that we were not snooping

271
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,040
on if we were into VT Pod Show? I like that confirmation for you. So, okay. So, stop with the snooping

272
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:12,760
stuff, okay? Because that's just inflammatory and unnecessary. Of course you're not being

273
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,560
spied on when you go to VT Pod Show. We're not an ISP. The only thing you get from us is a cookie

274
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:23,240
for login. You know, that's it. And I don't know anything about you. I have no idea who you are.

275
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,200
You're known as the nylon to me. I don't even know if you go to our side at all. And we do

276
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,560
not have that type of relationship with VT. We're not in bed as you call it. We have a professional

277
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:39,480
business relationship, which is mainly based on marketing, not on anything else. So, I categorically

278
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,080
can tell you that we do not track anything other than your login information to keep you

279
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:51,480
logged in persistently across the site. And I mean, it really bugs me nylon when you use these words.

280
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,640
I do think that VT probably was not wise in the way they rolled this out. And I know what it's

281
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:06,200
like when you get attacked for mistakes. We've certainly had our fair share of mistakes,

282
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,600
things we've done wrong. And immediately we get branded with the high jackers of feeds.

283
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,800
We fucked up, but to say we're high jackers like we're evil, that's internet fanboy crap. Stop it,

284
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:29,320
you dick. Second, media, nuclear energy. You kind of decide if we call something something else.

285
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,200
Then people will know that it's really part of testing or nuclear energy.

286
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,680
No, that's not what it's for us. Very clear about me, VT. The reason why we change is because

287
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,640
the media buyers, the people that we need to have spend money on our networks, so that we can make

288
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,800
money and the independent producers we work with, they were not getting the type of

289
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,440
buys, media buys that we could be getting purely because of the word podcasting. It was almost

290
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,320
directly the request of the media buyers. We're not trying to hide anything, just trying to make it

291
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,400
easier. I believe that, you know, that's up to the advertising industry. And I'm tired of fighting it.

292
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,360
Okay. I'm tired of explaining podcasting. I don't give a shit. If they wanted, if his

293
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:18,520
nevio is easier for them, then voila, so be it. Has nothing to do with nuclear energy. Now,

294
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:25,160
I will say that for nuclear energy, you can't compare the two because yes, in that case,

295
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:32,200
there's something very different going on. This is three, four decades of brand that imagery

296
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:38,440
that's in our brains. And I'm trying to work on everybody's brain if this nuclear energy is appropriate.

297
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,000
Trying to reprogram by rebranding it, which has done all the time. But again, you're doing

298
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,160
things. I hate it when you do that because it's apples to oranges, dude. So, all these

299
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:54,840
rebranding that you're a meteorologist, it's a DSC. You're going to reclan something. Let's go back

300
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:01,800
to what I've been at you for the last year, which is the daily source code is a misnomer. It doesn't

301
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:10,600
exist. So, I need to hear from you since you don't do a daily show. What is your contract with me

302
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:19,080
and the audio contract contract contract contract. Let me see, where's the check from nylon,

303
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:25,400
everybody? It must be around here somewhere. I'm, ah, G. And you out of your mind, you're, I forbid

304
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,680
you from listening. You're not allowed to listen to show any more nylon to contract. Dude,

305
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,640
I've been doing this for four years, 762 episodes, and then some before I started counting.

306
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,480
I'm doing it because I like it because this is a circle of friends. I don't need to have

307
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:47,800
fricking contract with you. You dick. Just, members, listen, what is your contact to us? When

308
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,360
can we expect to show some you and when would you live up to your commitment? I don't have to

309
00:26:52,360 --> 00:27:00,360
commit to anything to you at all. How would the arrogance? Where's your contract?

310
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:10,280
See, boy. Or we brand into the weekly source code, whatever it is. But we need a commitment. I think

311
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:17,080
we deserve a commitment. You're not daily. And we like I like to know anyway is what is your commitment

312
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,520
to us? I also note that typically between the Thursday and a Monday. Hold on, let me just get to

313
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:28,760
that commitment. Yeah, my commitment is whenever I can do a show, I'll do a show. That's my commitment.

314
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:36,920
And through the magic of this technology that we've cobbled together, when I'm ready,

315
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,480
and when I can do a show, it'll come to you. And by the way, when I do five days a week,

316
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,160
which does happen from time to time, and I'm not talking about my prostate cancer prevention

317
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:52,360
quota, which by the way, you definitely need to up your quota, dude. People who actually email me

318
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,600
and say that damn happy because they have so it's such a hard time catching up. And I'm trying

319
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,400
to find this balance between the time, the length of a show, and the number of shows that I put

320
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,880
out. Because if I do a show every single day of the week, five days a week, the show has become shorter,

321
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:13,880
some of the topics are less involved. And I'd like to do three a week. This week, it may only be

322
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:19,160
one, man. You know, I got shit to do tomorrow. I got to help my wife. I got to fly her bags.

323
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,960
I got to fly her bags to Holland. Well, she takes easy jet. Friday, she's got her last final

324
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,640
live show of Holland's Got Talent. I'm going to be there to support her. And now Saturday,

325
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,080
I'll be able to do a no agenda with with John C. Dvorak. You know, so that's a real commitment.

326
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:43,560
We do that once a week. You know, so that's my commitment. I wouldn't when I do a show.

327
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,680
My commitment to you is I'm going to do the best damn show I can. And if that's not enough for you,

328
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:55,800
screw you. If you have to do a podcast, it tends to be no agenda. So clearly no agenda is a higher

329
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,760
priority than making up when you're DSC. No, it has nothing to do with higher priorities. It's just

330
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:07,000
easier to do one show a week and schedule that. In fact, John is going up to Seattle to his,

331
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:12,200
to his daily this weekend. So we're actually taping it today. So today, I'm not only doing a daily

332
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,000
source code. I'm also doing a no agenda. Maybe later tonight or whatever. And you know,

333
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,600
I'm probably won't release it until Saturday. So they, you know, it's like, dude, get a grip,

334
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:29,240
will ya? So I just want to know what the commitment is to your DSC audience. And why not re-brand that

335
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,720
since you haven't been there? I don't have to re-brand that. It's it's a perfectly good brand

336
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:41,480
DSC. And by the way, every brand of this many times, DSC, it's the Charlie, it's the Cha Cha.

337
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:46,440
It's the chuckle heads. You know, that rebranding is all over the place, man. It really reflects

338
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,480
what the show is about. The daily has really nothing to do with it. By the way, John Stewart's daily

339
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,320
show hit, yeah, they aired the air in episode every day of the week, but half of them are repeats.

340
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:03,560
Charlie, the Germany pod show. Another example of you overcomersing and under delivering.

341
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:09,480
Now, let me just say something about that. Over promising is different than being enthusiastic and

342
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:15,480
open about what's going on in business, which is what pod show Germany is about. Sometimes things

343
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,120
happen and sometimes they don't. And sometimes they get delayed and pushed out later.

344
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,600
Sometimes things just don't work out, right? Like Trinity just didn't work out for a whole bunch

345
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:33,480
of reasons, painted myself into a corner. Hey, what can I say? Mia Culpa, you know, I don't owe anything

346
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,520
to you. There's nothing to do with over-promising and under-delivering. I think I over-deliver on a lot of

347
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,160
things. If I promise, I certainly, I'll keep my promises, but I don't think I've ever had the

348
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,280
had to promise anything to the audience. Certainly not to you. I don't know you. You don't use

349
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:53,480
your real name. Don't know what you do. You have no credentials, no credibility until you tell me

350
00:30:53,480 --> 00:31:00,440
what you do. And if anything, I'm really sad about Germany that is taking that is going to take

351
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,480
a long time. And the reason is because we were trying to get together with a partner in Germany,

352
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,400
and that didn't work out. And it wasn't the right partner for us. So we're still looking for another

353
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:17,640
partner. That's how those things go. All right. Trinity, he's an example. Last Easter, you came back and said,

354
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:23,640
I'm going to do a daily show with us a month every day. Yeah, shit happens dude, didn't work out. So what?

355
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,520
Cool Dawns. Oh yeah. Yeah, blame me for that. Dude, after that book came out,

356
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,680
guide us and want to fucking talk about the CIA anymore because he's so freaking depressed about

357
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:38,600
what he was a part of. I'm not going to force the issue on him. And do you ever listen to the show?

358
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,960
If you listen, you know all these things. You do. Now Germany, and they all kind of follow the

359
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,840
things. You go into them and they say, oh, I didn't know what I was getting into. That's right, man.

360
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:56,520
That's who I am. That's what I do. I try as many things as I can. I try things. I'm not afraid of

361
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,560
trying new things. And if it doesn't work, then I pick up the pieces and move on. In order to get

362
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,640
the success, you have to pass by failure a couple of times. I know this from experience.

363
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,080
Germany, part show is equal to investors wouldn't pump up the money.

364
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,120
Doc, excuse me, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Has nothing to do with that?

365
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,920
It was a pure business deal with a partner that didn't work out. Has nothing to do with our investors,

366
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,240
okay? And by the way, we are making money in this, right? We're not bullshitting around.

367
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,800
God, man, you just irked me. Which is good because I had to release some energy here.

368
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,160
The only other way to do it was to out my quota to seven for this week. So

369
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:50,600
difficulties in the UK, what the hell are you talking about? You know, you really are such an idiot.

370
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,760
You're typical of people who think they know it all. This is like dig. You know,

371
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,080
you go look at dig. Look at the comments. People always know, this is the thing with the internet.

372
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,200
It's really bugging me. All people do these days. It's going around and look at new stories.

373
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,760
Don't even investigate them. Don't really do any work. Just repeat it and give your opinion.

374
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,680
Okay? And the opinion is always flawed. It's based on flawed facts to start with. No one does any

375
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:23,640
investigation. She's like a news guy wannabe. And by the way, what's your real name? And what do you do?

376
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,600
What are your credentials nylon? You were saying, anyway, told my three things,

377
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:38,280
CT snooping, DSC, what's your commitment? And stop over. Well, that was the three minutes.

378
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,280
The only thing I've always promised is that the voicemail ends after three minutes. And you should have

379
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:49,000
known that you do. Anyway, here's something I do want to do since I am personally bummed about

380
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,400
Germany. For a number of reasons, first of all, I really like Berlin. I really love Potsdam.

381
00:33:53,400 --> 00:34:02,200
I really enjoy working with with the Germans. Oh, man. Got a burp. Kiss me off. Aggravation. You dick.

382
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:10,440
Can't even burp anymore. There we go. A little bit of gas. And you know what? We're still actively

383
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,800
looking for a new partner. There's some conversations going on. And I love the fact that I could

384
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:24,200
fly to Potsdam. That's what I really, I were actually just just out of Potsdam. Fly myself.

385
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,120
So I was really looking forward to that. And so I'm bummed more than anybody. And there's lots of

386
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,840
German producers out there who were bummed as well. And I really hope one day that we can pull that

387
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:37,480
together. I hope that I want to be in Australia. I want to be in France. I want to be in all,

388
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,840
I would like to be in the Netherlands. I'd like to be in all kinds of places. But you can only go

389
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,640
one step at a time, dude. There's only a couple of us. It's not like, we're not Google.

390
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,920
That's the same thing with our technology. People think it's so freaking easy to make things work.

391
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,200
Yeah. And people think that, oh, you have this much money. You couldn't do all these kinds of

392
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,440
things. And oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. That's like, there's what they're saying about Twitter now. Well,

393
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,280
they've got $15 million. They should be able to make Twitter work. You don't know what that

394
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,960
fuck you're talking about. $15 million does not buy you Google infrastructure, which is what I think is

395
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:17,400
basically needed to keep Twitter running. Which is probably why the investors put it in because they

396
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,040
know that that's a perfect acquisition target for a company like Google. If you're not in the

397
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:28,920
business of building large-scale systems, shut the fuck up. I'm sorry. I'm stuck. God, that guy really

398
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,760
ork me anyway. I want to play something that is for all of the German podcasters, producers,

399
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:42,200
and friends, and potential partners. One day we'll be together, my friends. Here's Ricky Gunst,

400
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,480
on a by-e-by of the tackling source code.

401

404
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,000
Worthless albums

405
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:41,040
Unfortunately, there won't be a song

406
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,000
Cross the strings for now

407
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,900
But with no sources

408
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,700
Now I go home

409
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,160
Sing with the heart

410
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,820
Even without any knowledge

413
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,980
I was going to steal the爾

414
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:50,820
And that is the hell of a bane that's so great

415
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,820
And to sense, I feel like I've lost for less than that cross.

416
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,820
However, just a slight second hit.

417
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,820
Hitch for tofu, my deem, by eBay.

418
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,820
We set up the pool all the time.

419
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,820
And when it's decided I'm the only one.

420
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,820
By the scams, no idea.

421
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,820
Ricky Guns, Alain, I forgot my label by eBay.

422
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,820
I'm selling my life on eBay.

423
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,820
Proof that the pod save music revolution is alive and well.

424
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,820
And Germany, thank you very much, Ali.

425
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,820
Ali from Bond and Germany sent that one in.

426
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,820
Yeah, I like it a lot, man. I understood most of it.

427
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,820
And I really appreciate you thinking of us there in Germany.

428
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,820
Oh, man.

429
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,820
I just got to calm down a little bit.

430
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,820
You know, what I've been playing in the past a couple episodes

431
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,820
is these poems that people have been sending in.

432
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,820
And of course, now I'm getting a whole shitload.

433
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,820
And some of them are rather long.

434
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,820
And I'm trying to find the ones that really strike a chord with me.

435
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,820
And think that they'll strike a chord with the chuckle heads out there.

436
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,820
And the first one I played, which really got everyone pumpin was from this girl named Aaron Livingston.

437
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,820
And she sent in a comment.

438
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,820
Hi, Adam. This is Aaron Livingston.

439
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:11,820
And I wanted to call and thank you for playing my piece on your show on 759.

440
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:17,820
It was really surprising to hear that somebody's one of your audience and read them.

441
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,820
Justin, he had heard of it.

442
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,820
I had the piece on the Indyfeed poetry podcast.

443
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,820
Oh, I didn't even know that.

444
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,820
It was slapped into the Daily Source Code drop.

445
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,820
Drop.au slash Daily Source Code.

446
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,820
By the way, I want to thank those guys for,

447
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,820
who are in Alpha for giving me 20 gigs of space.

448
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,820
Yeah, a little less porn, please.

449
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,820
Check out heads if you don't mind.

450
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,820
Well, the great system that is. Yes, I didn't even know it came from that poetry podcast.

451
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,820
Cool. Excellent. So the system really does work. I love it.

452
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,820
And followed it on to you and I just really surprised that that.

453
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,820
And even more so that you actually did take that and play it on your show.

454
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,820
And then that piece to a wider audience.

455
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,820
Why would you be surprised, Aaron?

456
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,820
You kidding me?

457
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,820
That was fantastic. That was raw emotion that was in there.

458
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,820
I mean, you broke down in the middle of that one.

459
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,820
But it wasn't even about that. It was the words. It was beautiful.

460
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,820
Really was about the words.

461
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,820
So, and whether that's a song.

462
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,820
By the way, if you release that stuff in MP3,

463
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,820
don't you have just as many rights as an artist

464
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,820
from a mainstream record label?

465
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,820
I'm just saying.

466
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,820
I'm really attached to the system lately.

467
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,820
How that works and this is a conversation that it caused

468
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:35,820
because I really think that this is a great example of what happened

469
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:40,820
and why I love playing so much is that it's, you know,

470
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,820
I think one of the best moments of free speech out there.

471
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,820
I mean, it's anybody can sign up.

472
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,820
You get three minutes to talk about whatever you want.

473
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,820
And get instantly back. You start by logging the audience.

474
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,820
And maybe thinking about something they never intended to think about.

475
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,820
And so, I don't Wednesday in a bar.

476
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,820
Where this happens normally.

477
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,820
And so, I mean, if you solve all the audience interaction

478
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,820
and public discussion and there's a chance to talk about

479
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,820
a lot of taboo subjects that get pushed aside.

480
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,820
So, I really, really do appreciate you.

481
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,820
Let me just say about that.

482
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,820
You know, so that is a beautiful moment.

483
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,820
That's what happens.

484
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,820
Nylon.

485
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,820
That's what happens.

486
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,820
Beautiful moments occur and you need to stop and savor them

487
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,820
because they don't happen all the time.

488
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,820
Well, they do happen a lot, but you don't always recognize them.

489
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,820
So when that happens when this, we've got this community of

490
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,820
chuckle heads of artists, little me, just trying to

491
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,820
direct it all around and get the stuff out to everybody.

492
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,820
It's a beautiful thing.

493
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,820
Enjoy it.

494
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,820
I'm sharing that with your audience.

495
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,820
And I'd like to let folks know that they are interested in more

496
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,820
of the poetry outlets.

497
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:56,820
There's a whole association, poetry, podcasting.org.

498
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,820
There's about 30 poetry podcasts out there.

499
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,820
And it's really great research.

500
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,820
And I encourage everyone to look through their first

501
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,820
thing that they like.

502
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:10,820
And there are quite a few folks that are writing about piece

503
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,820
and about the war and just politics and general.

504
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,820
It's a great form for that.

505
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,820
So I think, again, Adam, and I really appreciate what you're doing.

506
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,820
Have a good day.

507
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,820
Oh, no, no need to thank me.

508
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,820
Thank you very much, Aaron.

509
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:23,820
I appreciate it.

510
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,820
And if you ever got anything else, just to slap it

511
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,820
on drop.au slash daily source code.

512
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,820
Let's go.

513
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,820
Let's go.

514
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,820
Let's go.

515
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,820
You've got a good evening colleague.

516
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,820
Adam, sorry.

517
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,820
This is, I need more feedback on melting the pubic hairs

518
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,820
of your ballfect.

519
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,820
You were talking about that.

520
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,260
and since you already gave me advice on how to

521
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,500
smear my face with expensive moisturising creams.

522
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,740
I want to get more feedback of the very valid question

523
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,780
that tells the drunk and lumbar ass.

524
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,780
Hey, hey, hello. Hello.

525
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,780
Hello.

526
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,180
It looks like we lost them.

527
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,380
Well, sales guy, you bummed glad you asked.

528
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,860
Um, we, I don't know if we discussed this

529
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,860
abruptly back in the days of the cottage with the

530
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,580
Metro sexual moment, but yes, I am completely

531
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:28,180
cleaned down there and for good reason because, first of all,

532
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,940
it makes your dick bigger. Okay.

533
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,540
Let's just, let's just keep it at that.

534
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,940
When there's no hair, you know, there's just more to it.

535
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,980
It's that extra inch you will not be disappointed by that.

536
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,420
Sorry for the language.

537
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,260
I'll have to make sure that people understand this show

538
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,860
is not safe for work. It is of adults nature and content.

539
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,860
Not brand safe, unfortunately.

540
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,060
No advertising on this show today, my friends.

541
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,820
Um, I use a product called Feat Victor echo echo tango.

542
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,820
Uh, you put it on eight minutes later.

543
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,700
You hop in the shower and you're washed off with the facecloth

544
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,340
and you're good and done and make sure you go all the way

545
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,580
to the back there if you know what I'm saying because

546
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,340
your lady will love it and if it didn't

547
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:07,540
it, lady, then your guy will love it.

548
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,820
Trust me on that one.

549
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:15,060
It's been a while since we did that.

550
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,900
I'm, I'm out of control today.

551
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,900
Can you feel it? Can you get the idea?

552
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,460
Put your hands on your iPod. Do you feel it? I'm out of control.

553
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,620
Let me see. I was going to play this thing, um,

554
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,300
yeah, I don't want to do it now. It's too long.

555
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,340
It's actually on the daily source code drop.

556
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,340
It's a piece by home. Look at my notes here.

557
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,820
Representative Marcie Captur. She's a

558
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:43,540
Democratic representative of the house, uh, from Ohio.

559
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,420
It's a cease band clip and she's talking about something we've

560
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,660
discussed on the show before, which is basically the super

561
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,460
NAFTA, which is that whole, you know, is the agreement

562
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,380
between Mexico, the US and Canada, part of that is of course,

563
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,420
the Amaro, which people have discounted but also seems to be true.

564
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,740
This is one of the things Ron Paul was warning us about

565
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,460
and this super highway, which is going to go all the way from Mexico

566
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,020
up to Canada. And she quite clearly sets out exactly what's going on

567
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,140
and how secretive this is being done by the Bush administration.

568
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:15,620
Uh, but it's seven minutes. So, um, I might put it in another show.

569
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:19,620
But you can, as I said, you can find it on drop.au slash daily source code.

570
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,660
Um, and it's just, it's just, I don't know, the show's just rolling.

571
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:26,660
So I just want to do one more little intro here and the song and then I'll get out of

572
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,260
your hair, okay? Check this out.

573
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:33,380
Hey, Adam, it's being a beautiful morning out and I'm just, uh,

574
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,420
on my way. I haven't listened to the D at C760.

575
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,580
I love this show. Great. Um, just wanted to share a few things with you.

576
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:44,740
Um, first off, I'm standing out here wondering about global warming because I'm

577
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:49,860
smelling, uh, a smoke or the just inch from the big Santa Cruz mountain

578
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,940
fire here. And uh, and then I want to talk to you about the, uh,

579
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,860
they need a little bail on. Uh, you're, you know, I know you're making a big deal

580
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:02,500
about the government intervention. But, uh, just as an example,

581
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,300
if you recall the, uh, U.S. government bailed out the Chrysler Corporation.

582
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:15,540
Way back when, uh, late 70s. Anyway, um, the next thing I wanted to mention was, uh,

583
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,820
about your nuclear energy stuff. Here was, uh, and this one is a twofold.

584
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,860
Uh, it's about nuclear energy and it could help with the prostate cancer prevention.

585
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:31,700
Okay. There was a group back in the early 80s called the vapors.

586
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:38,180
And they, uh, they had an album title, new clear day. It was, uh, it was quite good.

587
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:43,140
They had a hit thing off of that. Um, they hit thing it was called turning Japanese.

588
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,860
