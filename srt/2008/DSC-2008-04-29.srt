00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,840
This is the daily source code

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,840
The daily source code

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,840
I was 16 million dollars worth of airplane scrapped to my ass

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,440
In the next generation radio content in my ears

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,320
We are the 3D 3D

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,480
I like to think I'm slang for each edition

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,120
Sure

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,320
I'm casting this out of theory

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,120
Like a sound you hear the lingo's in your ear

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,400
But you can't forget

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,400
From sundown to sundown

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,080
It's all in the air

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,200
He read everywhere

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,640
No matter what you do

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,400
It's gonna run around

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,440
Hold on you

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,040
California's so

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,640
California's so

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,280
It's like a song comes up every morning

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,760
And if you listen

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,360
Oh so carefully

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,960
Don't we listen right on our side

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,800
This song comes up every morning

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,600
So the people sound

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
To sing

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,400
If that's how the surrogate

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
Vermont told

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,240
To California's so

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,280
When you hear me

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,720
You want a patch of heat

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,920
And you've got to

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,680
Because it's really such

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,320
It's all in the air

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320

What's a brand new kind

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,960
I think you need your mind

39
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,080

California's so

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,720
It's like a melody and a little bit

44
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,920
Oh

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,880
What is it?

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,560

So how imprisoned

55
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,720

California song

63
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:57,760
I don't think it's pod safe yet it was dropped into the daily source code drop over a drop that I owe slash daily source code

64
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,880
and man who like this uh she's all over youtube as well so I guess there's some some area of

65
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,000
grain is as to whether I can play it or not or what a great song everybody's daily source code

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,280

almost that the setup is acting up again quite honestly I uh I was trying to keep my prostate

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,960
prevention quotient up and uh just need a little bit more time for those who don't know what I'm talking

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,320
about well you haven't been listening to the show very long have you or you haven't been listening to

75
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,400
show at all because this is the uh the new news that uh you should have tell men who uh masturbated

76
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,920
at least five times a day at five o'clock sorry didn't want to bring my own uh situation

77
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,440
near the conversation men who masturbated at least five times a week have uh less chance of uh

78
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,280
getting prostate cancer so um doing my best for prostate prevention and that's just one of the many

79
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,880
exciting things we'll talk about on today's show in fact uh things are heating up over here in the UK

80
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,240
and uh it's uh a topic that I do not know a lot about is not really been discussed on uh on the

81
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,640
Charlie I do want to open it up in particular to our listeners here in the UK we have a big

82
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:43,360
mayoral election going on in fact I think it's um it's uh councils throughout the United Kingdom

83
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,240
have elections coming up if it's it may even be today or tomorrow again this is just to show you how

84
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,000
incredibly ignorant I am and what I do understand though is that uh the mayor of London can

85
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,400
livingston who is uh member of the labor party that would be Gordon Brown the Prime Minister's party

86
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,800
looks like he could actually be uh kicked out by uh by this one guy named Boris Johnson I don't know

87
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,000
much about either of them but it is of course important uh to Gordon Brown if the capital

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,760
the leading city of the United Kingdom is no longer uh part of his quote uh control zone so this

89
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,040
is a very interesting race in fact it was brought to my attention that I really hadn't talked

90
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,880
about this by my good friend Charles the Drunken Londoner uh Charles Adam Hi Charles your drunk

91
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,480
Londoner um capitalistic firstly insurance that you know as you know I work in the media never ever

92
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:47,520
ever tell them what you do just say uh I mean just put for me I don't tell them I'm a producer

93
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,000
director now okay this is uh Charles actually referring back to my difficulties and obtaining

94
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,880
car insurance because of the field of work that I am so you know if they ask you what you do you have

95
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,560
to be honest and if they find out later that you lied you know it'll go on your permanent record

96
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,320
Charles they're assumed you're then going to have celebrities in your green tickle so I tell

97
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,960
my working mom yeah I'm going to have celebrities in my twingo yeah that's for sure that'll work out

98
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,280
I think which isn't online I am often caught up um as I work in most of the promotion sector

99
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:26,000
um so the other thing it's not a peak out of you about the Londoner or L'Election

100
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,840
what what I'm talking about you're only interested in the state politics come on man

101
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,960
everything around start discussing what's going on over here because um it really is a very

102
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:44,160
important vote for this for this the whole country really and uh being down and gulfed your uh

103
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,800
your fact thanks be affected by you also be affected affected by things like congestion charge and

104
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,240
the um you know back to that kind of thing parking piece uh so I'm hopeful anyway I'll ramble

105
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:02,480
on um uh my on my my view is is vote lib 10 second vote green or vice versa um

106
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,800
traffic red tennis who's done a good job but I think it's time to get him out and um

107
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,960
policy just a laughing boy anyway I think that yeah Charles thank you also you know I don't know

108
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,520
anything about these guys uh the only guy that has any visibility on my radar is Boris Johnson

109
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,400
because he's such a colorful figure you got and if you have never seen this you know see if you

110
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,720
can find some video somewhere on uh on google or uh or youtube of uh of this guy Boris Johnson

111
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:36,960
because he's he's kind of like a buffoon uh he's funny he does funny so if in fact they had a they

112
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,920
asked him a a question I saw this yesterday um where they asked uh you know the candidates

113
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,160
or maybe it was just some other setting where they asked him specifically uh some questions and

114
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,800
what was the one question was have you ever slept with a man and his answer was uh not yet

115
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,920
okay first of all that's a pretty heavy question you know we don't oops I'm about that we usually

116
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:08,960
don't get much further than uh uh boxers or briefs but uh man they go pretty far here in the UK

117
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,080
I thought that was uh pretty funny so I'm not sure who's representing the green party I have no idea

118
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,400
which party uh Boris Johnson represents obviously I could google it but I think we need to open up

119
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,680
that conversation and of course it's going to affect me here in gilford we're a greater London essentially

120
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:31,200
or almost if you look at it uh very dependent upon uh upon the city and uh yeah you know

121
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:37,120
would uh oh wow I just saw a couple of uh tweets come in from a 10-downing street which of course

122
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,680
is uh the UK version of the White House uh oh this is interesting Gordon Brown was on uh

123
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:52,160
GMTV this morning talking about uh cannabis check this out oh let me just get the uh let me get the

124
00:08:52,160 --> 00:09:01,040
story here okay um wow so this has been something of quite debate uh currently uh cannabis is

125
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:09,280
a class C category drug uh which uh would you can't I guess you can't get arrested if you are

126
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:15,360
in possession uh but if you have intent to distribute that you know but it's basically it's uh like a

127
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,720
small it's like a slap on the wrist I guess uh if you get caught with a class C drug and Gordon Brown

128
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,760
has been talking about uh upgrading this to class B and listen to the words that are coming out of his mouth

129
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:34,160
uh on GMTV this morning quote I have always been worried about cannabis with this new

130
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:44,080
skunk this more lethal part of cannabis wow uh you can say a lot about uh the skunk which uh it

131
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,240
doesn't seem to kill me yet but uh I don't think it kills people he goes on to say I don't think

132
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,080
that the previous studies took into account that so much of the cannabis on the streets is now

133
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:01,680
of lethal quality lethal notice these words lethal it's just not that's a lie it is not lethal quality

134
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,920
it's quality just take out the lethal part and he goes on we really have to send out a message to

135
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,840
young people this is not acceptable I've always had a very strong uh I've always been very strongly

136
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,760
of the view that cannabis is unacceptable and we have to send this message uh so uh this is really

137
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,320
the crux the important part of final report from the high-powered group of advisors was delivered to

138
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,400
the home office with the government's response oh I want to mess in this up uh where is it okay

139
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,720
so some experts including doctors police judges and drug counselors are understood to have concluded

140
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,760
that cannabis should remain in the class C category but Whitehall sources indicated that Mr Brown

141
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,600
was determined to push through reclassification to class B apparently because he says the stuff

142
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:59,600
is lethal that's just a lie I don't care what you say there studies about psychosis and uh split what

143
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,080
is it uh what's the other word for split personality I know you're yelling at uh at your iPod right

144
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:11,200
now um I can't come up with it but yeah you know the depression there's all kinds of stuff but lethal

145
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,080
I mean then you might as well say that about cigarettes man that shit is really lethal

146
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,880
uh we're going to hell in a hand basket now Boris Johnson on the other hand I do know this about

147
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,560
the guy he admits to smoke dope so maybe there's something there for us from the guy anyway oh by the

148
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,760
way before I forget I want to thank you all so much remember uh Masha Geller and of course it is

149
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,840
Masha without the R uh she runs the iMedia conference and she wants me on a panel in uh in May

150
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,000
with and it's around a really unfortunate day it's on a Monday and there's usually some really

151
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,560
important meetings that take place on uh on Monday and I know that I got some Mondays coming up

152
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,280
in this month so it's very difficult for me to pin down uh this date but uh essentially she'd

153
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,080
called in uh asking if I please would be on her panel and I said well you know if uh she would send me

154
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,360
a naked picture so uh thanks for all the emails and the phone calls uh that you uh placed to her

155
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,680
uh by the way I didn't know that she called into the show voice mail using her home phone number

156
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,760
that probably uh wasn't so smart on her uh on her part because you know anything you call into

157
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,480
the voicemail it's pretty much fair game but let me tell you boys and girls she sent me a picture

158
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:31,280
and although not and not an entirely naked picture she it's a smoking hot one so I am now trying to

159
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:37,680
make good on my word and twisting and turning everything I can to make this conference because

160
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,880
she's got more balls than a lot of guys I know here the empty toe show comes to the country home

161
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,560
of one of Britain's richest bankers and I'm joined us ever by our chief value the governor

162
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,000
of the Bank of England love and king now normally the books and works of art at this exclusive

163
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,040
residence would remain firmly behind closed doors but in today's nervous market bankers are

164
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,520
grateful for anything they can get oh that's right how to stir me for years they're able to

165
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:09,760
take advantage of cheap money and build up large fortunes and how how are they able to do this

166
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,200
because Gordon Brown and want to regulate I don't know why yes that's politics moving you know

167
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:21,600
economics have be very grateful if you stick to your field oh whatever here I could have a large

168
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:29,120
collection of collateralised debt obligation oh I see and what are they oh mortgages essentially I mean

169
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,040
large chunks of outstanding debt which normally the bank would package up and sell on isn't that right

170
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:42,080
yes except right now there's no one we can sell them to move it well I'd say looking at the date

171
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:51,280
I'd say these go back to the beginning of 2008 very common very popular especially in the United

172
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:58,080
States where they originated until the bubble burst and then people realize that these mortgage

173
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:04,880
backed securities were worth only a fraction of their value I say what would you say these are

174
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:12,480
worth no well as you can tell from the mark here and they're typically rated but you know when

175
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,840
they were made the manufacturers hid lots of things you know like inside like secret compartments

176
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,760
so you you really can't tell whether they're worth a lot or whether they're worth next to nothing at all

177
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,680
I see so we really have no way of knowing how much bad debt there is in here no

178
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,480
I'll give you 10 billion pounds for them oh you know just do it will you what about the model

179
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,880
hazard or look this isn't economics moving this is politics you know as well as I do that

180
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,920
if labor is about anything it's about supporting the bankers bailing them out it's not bailing them out

181
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,440
over it's a temporary liquidity solution oh I see like nationalizing northern rock

182
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,360
that isn't nationalizing it's temporary public ownership

183
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,560
I told you moving it's politics besides it's only a loan we can always ask for the money back

184
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,000
with its taxpayers money and in the meantime the taxpayers subsidizing the banking system

185
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,120
and that's where we've taken steps to make sure that the bank of England has more tax at its disposal

186
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,880
by doing the way with the 10p tax rate exactly so the poorest people in the country are going

187
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,080
to pay an extra 230 pounds a year to help shore up some of the richest banks

188
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,440
well I'm sorry moving but that's a labor government for you

189
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,120
I'm not quite sure where that came from it sounds like it came from the BBC was dropped in the

190
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,600
in the daily source code drop.io and I love it I think it's a word to say bird and

191
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,240
fortune so it must be some program from the BBC but what a way to explain it absolutely right on

192
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,640
what has happened here is and actually I have someone to give you a little more in-depth

193
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:57,600
on exactly what's going on with this is that the the British government has essentially given

194
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,480
all the upside to the banks and all the downside to the taxpayers with this 50 billion pound

195
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,920
basic securitization or it's even worse it's a derivative it's a swap of the bad loans they have

196
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,280
against government bonds and please people in the UK listen to me this is your money it's my

197
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,200
money's who I pay taxes here not just council actually income taxes and Gordon Brown just took

198
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:29,200
your money and he just gave it to the fucking bankers. This is Tracy and San Diego the monetary

199
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,000
scientist. Another guy who needs a name jingle tray I can't wait to hear what you're going to

200
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,040
say this is tray from run to gold dot com although while always has some interesting insights

201
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:46,000
into the way finances in the the global situation work and I really like what the Irish

202
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,040
Devont had to say and also you see that's the rhetorical question both keeps us free

203
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:00,320
well you see gold and silver are not merely valuable commodities investments or media exchanges

204
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:07,120
more importantly they are key checks and balances in America's legal and political institutions

205
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,160
I feel something from the constitution coming on we have article on section 8 plus by the

206
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,440
article on section 10 plus one the providers will monitor provisions of the constitution

207
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,680
but why is that because of that on Greensman said in the asking to the gold standard there's nothing

208
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,920
that stands in the way of confiscation to reinflation there's no safe store value and under the

209
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:40,960
federal reserve system we have a system completely in opposition to the constitution and what we

210
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,000
use as money is just political currency it's either a public debt or a private debt and if it's

211
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,280
a private debt then the banks they get to privatize the gains and socialize the losses which

212
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,520
is what Gordon Brown's doing with the housing mess okay that did you hear that let me just play

213
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,840
that again because he's really putting it in a reasonably eloquent way this is exactly what

214
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:12,480
it's happening and we're being ripped off over you see privatize all the downside and hand over

215
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,040
any profits to the banks and the hope that a reserve system is inherently unstable so it

216
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:25,120
lurges from one crisis to another and that's always expand and here the nature of being what it is

217
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,680
with air vise and limited and in station will read what will happen is it will culminate and

218
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,840
accumulate in an unsustainable bubble that will either implode in a deflationary depression or

219
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,200
explode in a hyperinflation so either one of these I'm sure is going to happen in a couple of years I

220
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,440
think a 2011 2012 is kind of the time frame that this is just going to collapse on itself

221
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,000
it all is going to come crumbling down because I agree I don't think it's sustainable

222
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,400
now the price of gold has been manipulated for two reasons one to suppress the evidence it's the

223
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,720
canary in the gold mine and second to throttle monetary evolution advances in currency

224
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:14,480
which I discuss some of them on my site run to gold dot com but really gold and silver

225
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,000
are what provide the foundations for democracy and limited government whereas you are currency

226
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,280
inevitably functions to a fashion and social is another forms of financial imperialism

227
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,760
one means is the great austrian economist said quote it is impossible to grasp the meaning

228
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:38,000
and idea of sound money if one does not realize that it was devised as an instrument for the

229
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,160
protection of civil liberties against a spotty inroads on the part of governments

230
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,200
is it just me or does this door does the tray sound a little bit like bill gates

231
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,040
listen to it for a second it really sounds like bill gates is talking listen to it

232
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,640
ideologically it belongs in the same class with political constitutions and those of right

233
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,800
so we want to have our our freedoms if we want to have control over our lives

234
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,360
instead of being controlled in our lives by government well we'll know the rule

235
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:20,320
she who has to go makes the rules and a lot of people just don't have the gold so they don't

236
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,680
make the rules and that's the way to do we have to run the gold

237
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,000
nah this is a bummer three minute time limit man that's it that's it's there for a reason

238
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,720
the same reason why there's a fast forward button on the iPod I got another comment about

239
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:44,560
the price of oil as it relates to the dollar from from a truce of aunt of the charlie prolific

240
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,680
programmer it's in real prolific programmer style way to let me get his jingle here for a second

241
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,040
I had to make the prolific programmer here for the first time I was looking out the

242
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,720
all right I was in the agenda episode number let me see what's this

243
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,200
20 years ago I think it was look you can't find it's listening to know what genre

244
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,000
let me get the number for you I got time

245
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:24,480
207 to be close it is now by nine p.m. I just wanted to

246
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:34,640
what point to comment regarding your little price here oil is pricing dollars

247
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,360
therefore dollar goes down oil price by nothing can go up and it tracks the euros that's

248
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,760
part of the world increase and I don't quite understand why it's so much but that is going to be

249
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,400
part of it and you're going to the Johnson before I can make some of you do this just

250
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,680
thank you prolific programmer you made it very clear you made it this clear some PHP code my friend

251
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,160
well that doesn't really hold up because the oil has now shot up to 116

252
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:12,560
close 120 dollars and the dollar actually has rebounded slightly so you know what happens is someone

253
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,880
farts over in the Middle East and that's another reason to go add four to five bucks to the price

254
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,600
of a barrel of crude you know it's it's crazy it is crazy shell oil today announced nine

255
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:30,320
billion dollars in profit thank you to the royal family of the Netherlands it's right being us come on

256
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,520
it's isn't that clear by the way I will say that a lot of investment

257
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:44,160
goes into developing new ways to squeeze us and I'm going to talk about alternative energy

258
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,360
but the oil companies are working very hard on other ways to get some kind of burnable shit out of

259
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:56,240
the earth and so they do use a quite a you know oil refineries are not cheap to build you know

260
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,720
these easily could be ten billion dollars and that's why a lot of them get together and consortium

261
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,120
consortia I should say more than one a little see these oil companies all building refineries together

262
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,360
actually I do know a guy who knows who works for a haliburton company

263
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,720
it's actually a cat and dan who I fly with and he he gives me a lot of insight a lot of

264
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,720
inside the details I'll ask him if he wants to come on the show and say anything about it

265
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,640
because most of the stuff he tells me is like hush hush you can't say anything

266
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,960
but I'm sure there's some things he's able to able to talk about

267
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,640
and we should just keep our eye on him because they're making lots and lots of money and

268
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,360
I don't know about you but I'm paying more and more to fill up the gas tank

269
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,440
well it's what you personal finance advice you can trust I had him done ready from what I want to

270
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,640
this week I talked about the much hated council tax and how you could be in line for

271
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,000
rebate of hundreds even sales and to pounds by getting your house rebanded and my tips

272
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,280
are on the three must-nose of financial jargon for this and more money saving advice go to the

273
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:10,960
website but want to watch a dot beatypot show dot com hi Adam this is Justin from back of the bus podcast

274
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,400
and I have to disagree with those who say there is nothing that we can do for china or

275
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,080
I guess more importantly for ourselves because you know the thoughts that we have inevitably

276
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,600
what you say is kind of what you do and then you know what you do is so you become

277
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:37,200
and who you become is really your destiny so you have to be careful what you think and what you say

278
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:49,040
and so it's more than just to be nice to say to believe in hope we really just need to

279
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,880
wouldn't you say and I don't want to think that one day I'm gonna be throwing my metaphorical as it

280
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:04,960
is key into the harbor as you've talked of before but it might if I'm living in a 10 city

281
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:13,520
as I see a lot of Americans are already today I mean what have I got to lose I mean

282
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,360
man anyway I know you're still looking for political hit pops so I dropped a track and I

283
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,840
would call Uncle Sam god damn great her hope you win three five times

284
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:59,760
come on welcome to the United States land of the sea home of the slave

bloodshed in a side creep in the broad instead of pages that are all good and long

288
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,200
the cold caught in a latch key child ran away one day and started acting fast

289
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,320
king aware the wild things are daddy's proud for the woman and tired and passed it down

290

him boarded and tortured a work force that never healed the wounds of ship the curse all

291
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:39,520
that a grown up alive nation holding up an artist is for the part of David can you feel nothing can

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,040
save you you question the rain you get rusted and cleaned up Chris raised but I must be in

293

land of the sea home of the slave the credit period your guard with a dollar is sacred

295
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:05,280
power is in the broad home of the United States land of the sea home of the slave

296
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:11,760
the credit period your guard with a dollar is sacred power is in the broad home of thousands of

297
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:18,240
that lazy the fuck you will blame me or rather they hate me only two generations away from

298
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,080
the world's most despicable slavery trade I and he it's no many ways to the greater human

299
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,840
being that it can't be changed in his day legacy so ingrained in the way that we think we

300
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:37,760
no longer need change to be enslaved no this is like the overseas even got a rate along the way

301
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,320
because the children can't escape from the pain and they born with the poison of hatred and

302
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,240
that fate trying to separate the man from his soul you always strengthen him and lose your own

303
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,400
wish you that fucker if you won't hit a frog mine him the truth is mine oh now I'm gone

304

00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,280
bleeding from their com talk about you don't support a crack yet what you think happens to the

people habit even if you ain't on a front line when that's a yellow crunch time you're right back

311
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,080
at it play look at how you hustle and backwards at the end of the year add up what they

312
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:49,120
subtracted three out of twelve months your salary paid for that man that's exactly what's

313
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,800
enough here to the gas plasma to see where they may dare to point the damn camera only a

314
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,800
you

315
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,280
and once again the protest is in the hip hop by the way not looking for hip hop especially I'll take any kind of

316
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:53,280
protest song it's about time five years after the start of this 90s war eight years into this crazy

317
00:29:53,280 --> 00:30:00,000
administration our world's going to hell in a hand basket I tell uncle Sam got them and by the

318
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,680
way when you guys put something in the daily source code drop please please please please give me a little

319
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:12,960
bit of information about who performs it where I could find it and we should continuously be trying

320
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,200
to get all these people under the pod save music network because this stuff deserves to be heard

321
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:26,400
by the way I want to congratulate LG the electronics manufacturer man they did a great promotion

322
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:33,280
which I think it popped one day early I'm not quite sure but I even I had seen these ads for a new

323
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,640
TV series which was called Scarlet you may have seen this this really beautiful girl with

324
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:45,120
which I presume would be either photoshopped or colorized lenses with these red eyes and it was

325
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,600
a new TV series coming soon the date would be April 30th and so today being the 29th and

326
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,720
news is pretty much out that and I guess it just popped earlier whatever I think they had a big

327
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:04,160
party in Los Angeles yes Scarlet TV is coming the Scarlet TV series in fact is what they called it

328
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:10,160
and it's right because it's a series of actual high definition flat plan flat panel televisions

329
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,400
so they created this trailer which and I wish I had seen the trailer before I knew that it was

330
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,960
a spoof because now that I see the trailer I can see I can hear kind of the words they used which

331
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,280
you know really are saying something different if you go back now in hindsight and review

332
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,680
you're like oh okay they're totally talking about something other than a TV series or it could be interpreted

333
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:35,920
in multiple ways and they got some hot actresses and I actors and a hot shit director to do this

334
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,960
and I think it's good I have no idea how the how the screens are but as a promotion you know

335
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,040
in this very very overcrowded loud market man I think they did a pretty pretty bang up job on that

336
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:57,680
congratulations LG now send me a free unit that's what I need oh second let me reset this

337
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,720
there we go we try this again right now that time pocket China any path that was getting

338
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,200
the government they deserve every person as a right to stop and say no this should happen to me

339
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,120
every person as a right to be a free system every person as a right to also give up all of these

340
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:19,920
rights to form a better society we forgot in the basic lessons of being a human the only thing

341
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:27,040
that we truly can so I'm gonna strive for is to be him all of these laws and rules that we put

342
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:33,440
in place are agreed upon how we should act as a society we forgot all of these things we forgot

343
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,200
there history we forgot what it's like to have to fight for something a grandparents knew it was

344
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,840
like to fight for something that appeared the first depression they learned how to say they learned

345
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:51,600
how to recycle before it was even called recycle yet our parents rebel against this in the

346
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,320
sixties they were telling against the ways of society against the way of having this group of

347
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,960
having to say that having to read it not like a word as let us they claim to be the the green

348
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,680
generation but it never really worked out that way they they found out that the corporate mentality

349
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:16,000
is what was needed to progress to be successful to make money and speaking and making money oil

350
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
profits can I take a minute of their time because last quarter they took in over a hundred thousand

351
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,480
dollars a second and yet they still obtain the subsidies for alternate fuels which apparently

352
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,240
are causing hunger to you out the world so I don't have any solutions the only solution I can say

353
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,160
is to stand up for what you what you feel is right and we all have a responsibility we all have

354
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,680
to make some sort of sacrifice to get what we believe in what we believe is right we just have to

355
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,120
be willing to make those sacrifices. All right do you see an organ.

356
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,400
All right man thank you yeah call back anytime good pipes by the way absolutely we're

357
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,760
pacified we're pacified with gadgets and toys and I don't just doesn't hurt enough yet you know

358
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,240
so there will be a breaking point when I and I think it will come down to to gas and that's

359
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,280
pretty much the easiest one I remember as a kid I remember when I just had my license and I was

360
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:19,760
living in the Netherlands and gas was about about one gilder which these days is about five U.S.

361
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:28,480
sense was one gilder to the leader and I remember when it went like one ten and I just started

362
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,080
working I just had a car and I had a you know from Amsterdam to Hilversum it's like those days

363
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,200
it was only a thirty minute commute but you know enough if you'd drive in around the work

364
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,200
place as well and you know you're doing this five days a week this commute you know at the end of

365
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,800
the week I'm like crap man it's like I may not be able to afford actually going up the gas tank

366
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:55,040
if it goes on like that I remember those days and we've got to be close we've really got to be

367
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,800
coming pretty freaking close to it being impossible or basically we're working to drive to work

368
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,600
I mean in the United States certainly in the UK maybe a little bit different I think personally

369
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,360
I think public transport in the UK is not all that bad of course I have the South West

370
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,080
trains which is the the rich fucker line so maybe they maintain that better but I've only had

371
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:23,200
good experiences in the past a couple years that we've been here but yeah you're right we don't know

372
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,960
what it is to really go through hardship we just in fact I would say thinking back on my parents

373
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,880
they were determined never to be poor but their measurement of what it meant to be poor was indeed

374
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:43,280
it was those really you know those really small things like you know having having to we're

375
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,960
not having to save money having any kind of cash but man you know in my family I'll take

376
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,360
my mom while the idea of nothing able to pay your bills was just you know it was just you know

377
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:01,440
man it was so deeply ingrained so deeply embedded that it was actually I think a psychological issue

378
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:10,400
almost and you can just see the evolution I think is what I'm saying and I look at the

379
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,240
generation dump today and man they have absolutely they've got it made at least if I look at

380
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,480
my daughter and her friends yeah there's all kinds of stuff going on and it's not nice to

381
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,000
live in a broken home and you know or be a teenager and pregnant but these are all luxury

382
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:33,040
problems as far as I'm concerned that she didn't happen back in the day you know nothing is

383
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,480
you know they all have money they all have some need they've all got a cell phone and iPod and time

384
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,640
on their hands and you're right man it has to get a hell of a lot worse before we're going to do

385
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,200
anything about it so it's alright I'll continue to complain now I take that task upon me willingly

386
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,040
oops man I'm just having problems with the controls today I'm sorry this is all pilot error

387
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:05,440

394
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,400
this police in China discovered a factory that was taking orders and fulfilling them to make flags

395
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,920
pro Tibetan flags free Tibet flags they're making so much they don't even know what they're making

401
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,480
guess that's in June is supposed to be the the 3G model and hopefully with longer battery life because

402
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,320
that was my biggest problem with the iPhone is my day just last longer than the typical

403
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:44,320
cupatino california seven hours you know I need to really be talking on that thing and I have

404
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,920
some pretty damn long conference calls sometimes and I just don't want to have to be plugging

405
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,800
in everywhere that's what you see people with iPhones keep an eye on them they'll have a power plug

406
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,560
in a you know jack for the 12 volt cigarette lighter in their car they'll have a docking station

407
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,120
at their desk you see them continuously charging these things because they just run out of juice too

408
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:10,960
quickly but alright Jeff I'll check it out man since I don't have a since I don't have an iPhone now

409
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,680
I guess maybe it'll work for other phones as well if it worked for my Nokia then I'll definitely

410
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:22,560
get some and I'm quite disappointed you know I've been the show has been sponsored and

411
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:29,040
part by acu quote acu quote dot com for the past couple of weeks and you know the deal with acu

412
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,040
quote and and you know these guys you know they listen to the show and actually I think the owner

413
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,920
of the company is a is a chucklehead himself and I have to admit that he's you know in what

414
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,400
we've done like three or four weeks and this is for life insurance which you should have life

415
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,360
insurance and I can't believe that every single one of you has and of course the reason that I wanted

416
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:59,760
to bring this sponsor on board is because I am a big believer in life insurance I've seen it

417
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:07,360
be put to be put to good use in horrible situations time and time again and we've got a fantastic

418

offer for you of the 70% discount on your life insurance if you use my my special link which is

419
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,440

420
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,640

421
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,920
if all of you already have it that's fine please let me know but if you don't let me know why

422
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,800
haven't at least it will actually a lot of you have you know gone to the website that's for sure

423
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:46,480
but no one is bought anything and I'd like to know why it doesn't make sense to me so let's find out

424
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,240
and by the way the owner's really cool about he said man I love the fact that lots of people are

425
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:56,400
checking it out and getting information um and the campaign is actually over I just wanted to

426
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,640
extend it a little bit because I wanted at least have one person who doesn't have life insurance

427

get it and if you all have it you know fine but if you don't let me know let me know what you're

434
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,880
second I'm just oh what is that oh there's my uh my 15 minute warning I got to talk to peda

435
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:57,920
here we go uh Lance what's this name Lance Larson and so I got to see Mill from Rob I think it's

436
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:04,800
say used in or us used in I would say maybe us in he says I recently got Lance Larson to post this

437
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,160
album on the pod save music network he's a very well connected Jersey boy good friends with both

438
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,880
booth and Bruce Bruce and uh jump on jovey interesting fact about Lance from his bio

439
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,760
it was uh during this period this is a quote from the bio during this period the Larson would

440
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,640
make as Kevin coined the New York Times would later write his most visible contribution to rock

441
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,720
and roll iconography here's the deal the red baseball cap in the cover shot of Bruce Springsteen's

442
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:39,360
blue jeans clad backside from born in the USA this picture was meant as a heartwarming gesture from

443
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:46,400
Bruce to his close friend following the untimely death of Larson's father and he's got a couple

444
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,240

It's held

454
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,880
It's held

455
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,920
We've grown your wings

456
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,920
I throw you in the eye

457
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,920
And I hear you sing

458
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,920
I need you

459
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,920
Your time is near

460
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,920
I've been dying to meet you

461
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,920
For so long

462
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,920
Long

463
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:18,920
I hate you

464
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:30,920
I hate you

465
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,920
I hate you

466
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,920
I hate you

467
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,920
I hate you

468
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,920
Lonely

469
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:36,920
I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny

470
00:46:36,920 --> 00:47:06,920
it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it, I'll deny it

471
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,160
The ISP I have shall go unnamed, but I've seen this behavior before.

472
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:19,920
I get it at Comcast, which I have in the condo in San Francisco, is you start to download

473
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,960
something and what I see happening or the behavior I see from the ISP is you'll get a tremendous

474
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,040
ban with throughput from maybe the first 30 seconds or a minute if it's a large file and

475
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,600
then it really drops down dramatically.

476
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,160
And I think that they've got some kind of filters on these things to say, okay, this

477
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:42,160
is clearly a piece of video or maybe it's a peer-to-peer, something.

478
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,920
I also really believe they're breaking connections just to reset peer-to-peer connections.

479
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,040
I see all I can feel it, you know, you've been on the internet as long as I have,

480
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,440
you can feel these things, you can feel the behavior, you have a couple of tools to look

481
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,520
at stuff and it starts to feel a little bit weird, but there's definitely some what they

482
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,400
call a ban with shaping going on.

483
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,520
And this is all kind of right now for this conversation, our AT&T, these idiots.

484
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,320
I don't know which idiot said it, you know, is coming out and saying, well, the internet

485
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,440
will be full by 2015.

486
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:24,760
Ah, the problem you guys have is you lied, you lied incessantly about unlimited access, unlimited

487
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:29,320
downloads, because at the time unlimited didn't mean a lot.

488
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,120
And you were slow to catch on to what was actually happening and now you know, it's

489
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,080
truth and advertising.

490
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:40,400
You've got to fess up and if the economics don't work and believe me, when it comes

491
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,040
to telecommunications, if you're bringing in, sorry, some Dutch slipped in there.

492
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,680
If you're bringing in less than you're showing out as with any company, it's not good,

493
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:57,240
but with telecoms, it can become an astronomical problem very, very quickly.

494
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,680
So just tell us what the real charges are, will you?

495
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,480
And where's the ISP who's actually going to come out and just say it?

496
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,480
We're fucked.

497
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,840
We got to charge you guys more, but we'll give you a really good service for it.

498
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,200
And this, by the way, has nothing to do with net neutrality.

499
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:16,760
It's just these guys who knew that this was coming and they haven't figured out how to

500
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,480
market it yet, because I really like that.

501
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,200
Oh, eat all you can.

502
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,160
Free salad bar.

503
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,560
It just didn't work.

504
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,560
Anyway.

505
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,360
That is not the biggest of our problems.

506
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,720
If you look at what's going on in the world, wouldn't you agree?

507
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,320
We still got our boys and girls killing each other in the desert, pisses me off.

508
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:40,880
Adam and mevio.com, dailysourcecode.com, curry.com, and of course, voicemail lines listed

509
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,720
in the show notes of dailysourcecode.com, please live your life with passion.

510
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,680
And tomorrow, we'll still be free, so enjoy it.

511
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,200
Another fine, mevio presentation, share it with a friend.
