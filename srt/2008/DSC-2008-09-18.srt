1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Delta's here at Charlie's 7-9 or 1.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,160
$16 million worth of airplane strap to my ass.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,920
In the next generation radio contenting my ears.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,360
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,400
All testing, it's NATO Curry.

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,160
We want to leave, take a care

7
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,760
How we find a lot of nice things to wear

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,160
But then a lot of nice things done by our bed

9
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,160
Oh, baby baby, it's a wild boar

10
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,160
It's hard to get by our heart just to punish my heart

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,960
Oh, baby baby, it's a wild boar

12
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,760
I always remember you like a child

13
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,760
You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do

14
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,560
And it's breaking my heart into

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,560
Cause I never want to see you sad girl

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Don't be a bad girl

17
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,560
If you want to leave, take a care

18
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,760
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there

19
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,560
But just remember there's a lot of bad

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
I wouldn't be well

21
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,960
Oh, baby baby, it's a wild boar

22
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,360
It's hard to get by our heart just to punish my heart

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,160
Oh, baby baby, it's a wild boar

24
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,960
I always remember you like a child

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:27,360
Live it, laugh it, laugh it out, laugh it out

26
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:57,360

Oh, baby, baby, it's what I hold on

29
00:03:32,360 --> 00:04:00,360
Oh, yeah, baby, it's a wild, wild world

30
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,360
And we're just actors on the stage playing our part

31
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Hey, John, what is I doing?

32
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,360
The resource code episode number seven, nine or one

33
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,360
And it's September 18th, 2008, where is the time going?

34
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,360
I'll be sucked into the continuum I guess

35
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,360
For the first time now, I start my day off by going to the drop

36
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Because that's where all the news is that's the real news

37
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Drop.io slash daily source code, this show of course

38
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,360
He's comprised of that, that is the true source code to this program

39
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,360
You guys produce it, I just put it together and try to guide us along

40
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,360
Hey, it's been a pretty nice day today in the United Kingdom

41
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,360
And I've been home for, well, I haven't been home, I've been in and out of London doing meetings

42
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,360
There is also some stuff that's been happening like we released a whole new version of the site

43
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360
That's pretty cool, mevio.com in the States and BT Pod Show

44
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
And in the UK, very proud of the work that we've done

45
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,360
And finally things coming together the way we envisioned them

46
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,360
So that's been nice, but also of course I've been pretty much glued to the television

47
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Said whenever possible to CNBC, which we get over here in the United Kingdom as well

48
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Just following the markets, it's been, I mean, it's been really fantastic

49
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,360
To watch all of this predicted, all of this foreseen, all of this of course

50
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,360
has been completely planned, we've talked about that here on the Charlie Shuckleheads

51
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Are in the know

52
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,360
And today, I really only wanted to handle two topics

53
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,360
It was going to be a pretty short show, and I just wanted to whip through it

54
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,360
And as I started going through the drop, and yeah, there's only a couple of ways for me to do this

55
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Either I do a show every single day, which is shorter and just get the news out

56
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,360
That's coming in or I try to aggregate it and make some kind of coherent story out of it

57
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,360
And give you some real valuable information, because I too have to process this is so much coming in, so much going on

58
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,360
And of course the financial markets is what everyone's talking about

59
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,360
And you know, I just, all these comments, because that of course is the new place to leave voicemail

60
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,360
Right there on the drop, drop.io slash daily source code and

61
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Well, here's one right now, out wait a minute, this one isn't just a comment

62
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,360
It has its own jingle, of course

63
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Hold on how much time will it be going in

64
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:45,360
I, I don't know what the number 10th is

65
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,280
me pretty Mack now my my I've never been a question I don't I don't I don't know

66
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,960
here the answer but what's the purpose of probably banging sector if all

67
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,480
what if all that happened my northern rock is taking over my coming in the

68
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,600
Bank of England right right is it I don't know yeah that's all in demand

69
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,600
so maybe your mind is advancing you know on this many thanks cheers well we

70
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,880
have lots of savants and and they've been sending me messages I've been

71
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,880
aggregating information I've been learning and I'm going to try and

72
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,680
distill the most important parts for you right now so first of all what's

73
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,360
happening now in the financial sector is the people who are used to making money

74
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,360
with money OPM is even better other people's money they're the ones that are

75
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,400
going down so they're going down but of course the people who are truly

76
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,600
putting the bill is us and that's why I'm highly interested in this because today

77
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,560
even though I haven't followed much of the news today I had another meeting and

78
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,040
really it's been two hours the last two hours just preparing for the show

79
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:54,280
hundred and eighty billion one eight zero billion dollars put into the

80
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,600
pumped into the economy as they say it by the federal reserve approved by the

81
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,080
Treasury Hank Paulson all criminals by the way I'll just say it outright I'm

82
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,240
not afraid to say it stealing our money this is and this of course is you know

83
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,760
if the pension funds haven't already been rated to the max then then this is

84
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,320
just printing money which means inflation on the way of course the coordinated

85
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,800
effort with the European Central Bank and with the Bank of England and this is

86
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,720
all to keep themselves afloat which isn't as futile it's not actually going

87
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,960
to work and the piece I wanted to explain to you is AIG this of course was the

88
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,400
news yesterday American international group AIG is an insurance firm it's a

89
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,840
holding firm of multiple types of insurance companies now you have the

90
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,720
traditional insurance companies that we know about car insurance how

91
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,760
insurance or home insurance I should say they in fact have a big aircraft

92
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,840
division for insurance who knows some of the insurance I have on the Delta Delta

93
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,600
Sheriff may even be through a subsidiary of AIG it's absolutely possible now we're

94
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,680
not supposed to or don't we're not supposed to be worried about these particular

95
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,720
companies because they are regulated by the government and the government you

96
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,840
know we're supposed to take a look and keep a watch fly and make sure they

97
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,040
have enough reserves that in case lots of claims come in that they can actually

98
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,280
pay for them and that regulation is done on something you keep hearing a lot

99
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,880
of these days the faith and credit of the United States of America the

100
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,720
faith part of course is the most interesting one because that means people

101
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,200
would have to believe in us believe our story well it's starting to get pretty

102
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,160
thin here my friends now the important part the part that's really

103
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:41,880
in measurable in size is the derivatives business the insurance of bonds now

104
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,600
already I can see your eyes maybe glazing over I really want to give this a

105
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,800
shot and try and explain how it works because as well worth it and then you

106
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,680
can understand the vastness of of the problem with the AIG and why it's all

107
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,920
interlinked and related so a derivative a simple plane derivative or swap a

108
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,440
credit default swap you'll hear people talking about this all the time the CDS

109
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,680
don't just pass over that let's pay attention to it let's find out what this

110
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:15,400
really means because it's it's interesting the the swap is put into place and

111
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,480
I learned a lot about this when when I worked at in-house actually with

112
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,320
our first company was thinking of ideas I'm wondering if it was still on ramp

113
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,880
of we've gone public by that point it was somewhere around that time and

114
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,280
bankers trust which is long since been sold and folded up into some other

115
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:38,480
bank traded mainly in derivatives and they hired us to build and market for

116
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,080
them internally a web-based trading desk and so I learned about these swaps and

117
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:51,160
a swap is very simply put if I have a bond okay so bond is basically it's

118
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,360
it's a collection of assets now this and these assets can be mortgages that

119
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,680
of course is the true problem we're looking at today but it could also be another

120
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,680
type of bond David Bowie issued a bond for fifty million dollars about ten

121
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,720
twelve years maybe longer than that maybe a maybe thirteen fourteen years ago

122
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,040
so he put fifty million bucks in his pocket and then the bond holders of

123
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,880
course have the right to go and use his his music mainly on commercials and

124
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,760
other stuff so this bond is going to throw off a certain type of yield which

125
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,680
means it'll make money just because of the value that it'll have an in-flow

126
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,560
of cash now let's just take it as a mortgage bond so I've put together I'm

127
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,280
making simple making million bucks doesn't matter that much worth of mortgages

128
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,960
and I've structured that into a bond and by the way I'm not a sovarant on this

129
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,520
topic I'm just telling you from a simplistic I'm a disc jockey okay so just

130
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,960
from reading and and and asking have been able to aggregate this information

131
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,400
it's not entirely right I'm sure and people can correct me but in essence

132
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,640
I'm pretty sure I'm spot on so you collect all these mortgages together there

133
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,520
worth a million which means they should be spinning out maybe a hundred thousand

134
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,960
dollars a year and you can sell this you can sell this to someone else let's

135
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,560
say I want to sell it to let me see John C. Devorac would be a good one now

136
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,480
John C. Devorac has to eventually pay me back for that right now if I'm not too

137
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,240
sure about his credit worthiness I might want to take out some insurance just in

138
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,120
case he defaults on that bond so I used to be able to go to a company like AIG

139
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,120
and say AIG I guess what I got this million dollar bond I've sold it to Devorac

140
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,920
but you know you guys please send me so many some insurance so that if he

141
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,760
defaults that I still get my million bucks back and maybe even plus some you

142
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,320
know yielders and interest or whatever and they'll write that you know just

143
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,040
like you can get health insurance or it's not not crazy you know people

144
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,560
write you insurance for a for a car crash thinking that you know you'll probably

145
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,520
pay it more than you'll ever have to claim and they have all those no claims

146
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,640
bonuses and all that you know so that you are incentivized not to claim anything

147
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,440
you know you have your your own risk portion and all that but it's exactly the

148
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:15,160
same thing only this is for someone defaulting on payments and AIG of course

149
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,920
will pay me will charge me money for that and that's typically measured in

150
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:28,200
basis points so in those days maybe it was 70 basis points which would be

151
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:35,480
$7,000 to ensure a million dollars worth of bond okay so that's a pretty

152
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:44,840
simple system now what's interesting is that AIG they can now say hey you know

153
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,720
we've sold this insurance to Adam based upon this money that door this bond that

154
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,400
he's lent to a devourack one and we so that's $7,000 that's coming in from that why

155
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:02,600
don't we packed together you know a 10,000 of those and go sell that and by the way

156
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,920
we're probably gonna go get insurance on the person that we sold that to so you see how

157
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:13,000
the domino start to stack up in fact this has gotten so broad and so massive that

158
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,760
AIG probably was ensuring money they had already ensured two or three times over

159
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,440
what's crazy about these derivatives particularly the credit default swaths and this is

160
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,960
what I learned working at bankers trust is that it's not was not really regulated as far

161
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:36,440
as I know it's all done on phone calls and the contracts are fact you know there's no real

162
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,520
trading system then there may be but now but when I was working with him in the 90s it was just

163
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:49,080
facts is going back and forth vanilla deals we call them very very simplistic stuff and

164
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,600
you know really the traders had the knowledge in their head and they had all their what they call

165
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,200
counter parties and this is you know and they just transform money based upon the contracts

166
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,840
but of course this inflates the actual original value that million dollars inflates it to

167
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,560
maybe a billion dollars worth of money that's floating around their system their system mind you

168
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:16,600
now when these people don't trust each other independently then everything starts to unravel

169
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,480
and of course the unraveling of that is you know how the you know geez how you how do you

170
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,880
find out where all this stuff is you know it's you've got to get all the facts is and you've got

171
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,800
to unwind these layers upon layers upon layers of lending to each other which is how banks make

172
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,920
money they lend money and whether it's in the form of insurance or whether it's in the form of

173
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,960
a bank loan which of course is not real money it's all just that it's you know it's it's a loan

174
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:51,080
it's a it's an entry in a spreadsheet it's not much more that is what created this this huge issue

175
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,160
and this is in the trillions of dollars it's a hundred and eighty billion dollars it's you know

176
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,200
unfathomable amount of money but it's a joke compared to what the issue really is and now that

177
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,520
and on these banks they just don't trust each other how do you know they don't trust each other

178
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:14,360
is because the spread or the rate of lending to each other or that's let's put it this way

179
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:21,160
AIG where they used to get you know 70 basis points will be kind of you know what you'd have to pay

180
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,080
if you were doing business with AIG that has now gone up to two thousand basis points

181
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,320
so to borrow ten you know to ensure against ten million dollars you'd have to pay two million

182
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,240
dollars and insurance well that obviously is not a real strategy because you're not going to get

183
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,400
that kind of money in from the original ten million that you loan that you want insurance upon

184
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:50,360
so AIG although we now own 79.9% of it as American taxpayers is useless it's you know yeah

185
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,520
maybe we'll make some of that money back by by selling off all the individual other pieces

186
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,000
and that's only taking into account that you know the regulators have actually paid attention

187
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,160
and haven't been you know having sex with the with the insurers and doing dope with them like

188
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,960
the mineral management agency has done with the oil companies let's just say that didn't happen

189
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:20,680
then we might be kind of safe for the what is it the 85 billion that they they gave to AIG in return

190
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,880
for 80% and by the way I don't want my government running the companies that I'm a co-owner of screw

191
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:32,040
that shit now I could go on and on about this but at least I hope you have a small idea of

192
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,840
well it's a pyramid scheme or a Ponzi scheme really what has just been built up and it's all

193
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,920
come toppling down which is exactly as we predicted to talk a little bit more about this issue I yield

194
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:48,200
my time to the distinguished gentleman from Texas congressman Ron Paul this is from his website

195
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,680
that he posted yesterday pre the 180 billion infusion into the markets which of course was printed

196
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:02,040
up and is also our money doctor run hello today we had a lot of financial fireworks in the

197
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,480
markets a lot of things are going on and I think we are in the middle of something going on it's

198
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,400
very big it doesn't look like it's going to end real soon today the Federal Reserve came in

199
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:21,640
and offered 85 billion dollars to buy on AIG and it looks like it's never going to end they're talking

200
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,040
about the next company whether it's more in Stanley or whatever already we've been able to

201
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,920
fannie me and Freddie Mac and the layman's went bankrupt and then of course of course Bear

202
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,560
Stearns had a bailout not too long ago and we're talking about big bucks we're not talking about

203
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,880
hundreds of millions or even hundreds of billions now we're talking about trillions of dollars the

204
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:49,400
obligation is immeasurable nobody can measure it and the derivatives markets very much involved nobody

205
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,280
knows how much you're involved but all I know is they're starting to unwind and that is why all these

206
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,800
banks and investment companies are in such big trouble and all the only thing they can resort to is

207
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,680
coming coming to the federal government coming to the Federal Reserve and asking for bailout the

208
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,080
interesting thing is like today coming up with this 85 billion dollars they don't come to the

209
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:15,240
Congress I mean the Federal Reserve buys them out they own it we we as taxpayers now own

210
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,880
me and Freddie Mac and nobody knows how much that will cost that could be that could be into the

211
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,800
trillions of dollars so they don't come to Congress we don't have appropriations it's done by secret

212
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,080
government private individuals behind the scenes moonoving them and they'd be lighting and trying to

213
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,120
patch things up but of course in the meantime I'm sure there's a few people making a couple bucks

214
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:42,200
out of this whole thing today and foreign affairs committee we had a bill come up was considered

215
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:50,440
insignificant it was only only a billion dollars and it was to send aid humanitarian aid to Georgia

216
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,840
and there was some debate on it which was fortunate but about 25 of the committee members

217
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,160
didn't show up for the vote he's going to be put on this suspension believing that they'll get

218
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:07,880
two thirds vote very easily and they say well it's humanitarian we need to help him and yet that is

219
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,920
such a controversial issue going on and to me it's just a disaster to pump more money in the

220
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:20,680
Georgia stirring up trouble can provoking Russia trying to reunite the Cold War all these many

221
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:26,040
many things but financially speaking we don't have a billion dollars I mean where are we going to

222
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,800
get it they try they're going to appropriate and authorize this money but they're not going to

223
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:37,880
raise taxes in the next few months to pay for this and they'll probably have to borrow it or you

224
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,240
know get it from the federal reserve some way you know just monetize them down and and get more money

225
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,960
but with all the problems that we have we have in this country the infrastructure in this country

226
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:54,520
we're still going around we're looking for more problems so in a way this casualness on how we

227
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:01,000
spend a billion dollars overseas and foreign aid for humanitarian purposes which in reality is a military

228
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:09,640
support for that government who's supposed to in return protect an oil pipeline in that country and

229
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:17,720
even this bill actually stated that it had something to do with the pipeline so this this to me is

230
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:25,800
is just you know a symbol of how serious the problem is that this is not even event and yet the whole

231
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,680
Cold War with the Russia with Russia now they restart stirred up again at the same time our

232
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:37,000
financial markets are collapsing today the market was down 450 points a couple of days ago down

233
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,960
500 points a gold I mean filing people made it got some sense and said hey this can't help the dollar

234
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,200
when they bailed out the money made pretty mac in the market this was in in collusion with the

235
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,920
Chinese because the Chinese were getting worried because they held so much of the security so we

236
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,840
had to bail them out as well to protect our dollar so the Chinese government and the American government

237
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,520
were in bed together and the immediate reaction there was it was a tremendous boost in the dollar

238
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,520
but that had to be temporary because you can't create money like we're doing and in order to support

239
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:17,320
the dollar because ultimately it hurts the dollar and everything we do in Washington today whether it's

240
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:24,200
on the appropriation size whether what the fit is doing buying up America is all put in pressure

241
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:32,200
on on the dollar and one of these days we're just going to have to wake up and say that we need

242
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,200
to liquidate debt this is a malinvestment our problems come from the fact first they start with

243
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:44,920
the Federal Reserve is a monopoly and it controls interest rates artificially low causes

244
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,480
people to make mistakes that's the basic source but they don't top of that in the housing market what

245
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:55,800
we had we had the community reinvestment act which told investors that they had to loan to risky

246
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:02,520
borrowers and that was a complication hard to contribute to this FDIC contributed it's called

247
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:09,800
moral hazard everything that we have done over here creates moral hazard that is we assure people

248
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,360
or assume that we'll take care of everybody just go out and take the risk it's the opposite

249
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,720
of the marketplace and then they have people come along and say see this is the failure of capitalism

250
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,400
this has nothing to do with capitalism this is something that started off as interventionism

251
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,760
and us being too involved in the economy for the benefit of special interest but now it's being

252
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:37,640
socialized out in the open I mean we the taxpayers now own mortgage companies insurance companies

253
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,240
and we're going on a lot more if our car companies need build up believe me it's going to happen they're

254
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,120
not going to let all our car companies go broke either but this will come to an end the end of this

255
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,560
comes when people reject the dollar and I think we're getting off we close to this we we you see the

256
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,840
movement we're seeing in the markets today we know that there are serious problems out there and

257
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:05,160
Congress basically are oblivious they had no idea what's going on better back I'm not even sure

258
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:11,480
the Federal Reserve has any idea what to do about this they've been manipulating maneuvering

259
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,320
for their benefit over the years but eventually the market wins out and right now I think the market

260
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:24,360
is is saying that this is so serious and so big that we better be prepared and the reason why

261
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,160
this is so important if we care about people and humanitarian sense what you want to do is protect

262
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,600
their value of the money just think of the third world nations when they have total runaway

263
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:38,440
inflation the middle class gets wiped out and today what we're seeing today is the middle class

264
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:46,520
being jeopardized by this type of system we have of unlimited spending unlimited debt

265
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,760
unlimited creation of new credit so it's time that we wake up I think a lot of people are waking

266
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,640
up and starting to realize this but also there's a lot of people starting to panic but the answers

267
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,280
are there the answers are in the free market and sound money in our constitution but we did that

268
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:08,440
we could solve it wrong it's so far we haven't seen very many people resorting to going back to the

269
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:15,240
basics the basic principles of the marketplace capitalism and our constitution

270
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:38,920
we're going back to the market and we're going back to the market and we're going back to the market

271
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:13,720
and we're going back to the market and we're going back to the market and we're going back to the market

272
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:29,800
and we're going back to the market and we're going back to the market and we're going back to the market

273
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:45,880
and we're going back to the market and we're going back to the market

274
00:28:45,880 --> 00:29:01,960
and we're going back to the market and we're going back to the market

275
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:31,960
and we're going back to the market and we're going back to the market

276
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:48,040
and we're going back to the market

277
00:29:48,040 --> 00:30:04,120
and we're going back to the market

278
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:34,120
and we're going back to the market

279
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:40,120
and we're going back to the market

280
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,160

00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:08,920
ensure okay and then think about uh why he need he and i think he's he's bullshitting us i think

294
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,960
you know i saw um letters on cnbc where he's really angry that they're doing this and all we need

295
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,560
it is a bridge loan and we shouldn't have sold out yeah i think it this is another crony getting bailed

296
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,440
out that's the way i read it that's just my personal opinion because then again the hell do i know

297
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,520
i'm just a dj uh dj former vj i linked to that story which is really worth reading in the

298
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:35,720
show notes daily source code dot com hey adam this is reaching home from Brooklyn, New York

299
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:42,840
uh just wanted to drop you a quick line say hi i just finished watching that uh zero nine eleven

300
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:49,560
investigation uh documentary which i thought was awesome um i just wanted to thank you very much for

301
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:57,000
turning me on to that and turn into world on to it uh i i uh seen other uh documentaries but this was

302
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:05,320
very extensive filled and a lot of the questions that i had and certainly uh brought to my

303
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:14,520
attention some some unanswered questions um i uh uh actually cut and pasted it to my uh blog page

304
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:21,320
and uh turned everybody i know on to it uh Facebook and all my friends and stuff like that so uh

305
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,200
people's a good work thank you so much for everything that you do Adam um a long time listener this

306
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:35,480
is my first call uh uh i don't know my sign off uh that's a name definitely uh uh work for us

307
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,920
and uh thanks for everything uh yeah and we got to keep reminding him Richard from Brooklyn my friend

308
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:47,000
that's all i asked for that is all i want there's an awakened citizen a true patriot that's

309
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,680
all you have to do first we need to we have uh a lot of movement right now and although it's uh seven

310
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,640
years old at this point nine eleven is a good starting point we'll talk about that later on in the

311
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,040
show but it's a good starting point to help people wake up just because there is so much evidence

312
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:11,080
empirical evidence that does not fit with the official conspiracy theory so uh that's all i'm

313
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:16,680
asking for it's just passed it on get people you know help people uh understand what's really going on

314
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:23,640
okay and uh that means you couldn't turn them on to this show or or a multitude of websites that

315
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:28,040
they're out are out there and there's this uh on there must be a hundred different uh quote

316
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,760
documentaries that of course is my favorite the zero and uh investigation to nine eleven which is an

317
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:39,800
Italian documentary which just makes me laugh because uh you know funny how we actually need the

318
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:46,360
Italians to show us how blind we are for what's been going on uh here's a topic i i didn't plan

319
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:51,480
on bringing up but after going through uh email and the show notes i i did want to just uh aggregate

320
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,320
all of these different reports and this is about the uh cervical cancer uh vaccination that i am so

321
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,040
against and i'm not just against the cervical cancer vaccination pretty much against most of

322
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:08,360
vaccinations um because i i don't trust our government and i don't trust our government and uh our

323
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:15,000
drug approval process to actually um allow them to inject something into my child now let me point

324
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,080
out that obviously when it comes to tetanus when it comes to polio uh when it comes to hepatitis

325
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:30,760
um these uh inoculations these vaccinations this uh yeah i've had them i'm still reasonably okay i

326
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:38,200
guess uh but it is my belief that the government lies to us uh for all kinds of reasons and i'm seeing

327
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:45,880
more and more proof that uh part of this uh particularly this hpv vaccination which is um called

328
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:54,520
Gardasil Gardasil Gulf Alpharomio Delta Alpha Sierra India Lima um that it's uh first and

329
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:00,840
foremost it's a scam to make money for the biggest drug companies on the earth the pharmaceutical

330
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:06,280
industry. Of course there are big trouble now because you know they have these patents and uh uh

331
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:13,000
the main one lipitor is uh running out which means then anyone can make it and uh and uh and there's

332
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,240
no huge profit so they need to you know there's nothing really left in the pipeline except for

333
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:23,720
of course the avian bird flu which uh as we know is a something that might have killed 150 people

334
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:29,160
uh in the 15 years that we know about it if that um but there's billions of dollars that they're

335
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,320
counting on for making uh up the vaccination which means they actually have the virus you can't

336
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:39,240
make of a vaccination for a virus without having it i'll get to that in a minute but um um the uh

337
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:44,120
the cost of uh polio tetanus hepatitis vaccinations which of course have been around for a long

338
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:54,200
long time uh four dollars this new um hpv one hundred and forty four dollars so that's a scam

339
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,840
it's a scam for them to make money and it's being rolled out globally we know about it in the United

340
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:04,600
Kingdom we know about it in the Netherlands uh coming in Canada, Switzerland and this is one of my

341
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:11,640
favorites uh left on the drop uh Renato uh Castillo from Brazil um I'll quote literally

342
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,520
Adam it's happening man Brazilian health department is doing a mass vaccination mainly men

343
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:24,440
between the ages of 20 and 39 their goal is to vaccinate 7070 million people the vaccine is for

344
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:31,720
German measles German measles even though we don't have any epidemics and and by the way you

345
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:37,640
can survive the measles okay you will not necessarily die from the measles and all of this is

346
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,560
to comply with the Pan American Health Organization determination to mass vaccinate people all over

347
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:49,880
Latin America and he sent me uh two links unfortunately they're in Portuguese and uh I don't speak it

348
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:57,960
but check those links out in the show notes a daily source code dot com along with that uh this one is

349
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:05,800
this one just blew me away uh this is all the drop uh this is from uh is MSNBC Austin Texas this

350
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:13,080
from 2007 uh turns out here is some conservative and parents rights groups are worrying that

351
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,960
requiring girls to get vaccinated against the sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer

352
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:23,240
would condone pre-marital sex and interfere with the way they raise their children uh this is mandatory

353
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:30,520
uh shots for this HPV which again it is it's only something you get from having sex okay

354
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:37,720
and uh typically having sex with a lot of guys and a lot of guys with dirty dicks

355
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,080
and and that's a that's a poor man's assumption but that's pretty much what I understand from the

356
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:50,120
literature so it's not quite like polio okay and giving it to 12 your girls basically says okay so

357
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,160
go ahead but what else is in those shots that's what I want to know that's the part I don't trust

358
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:01,240
uh please someone here's what I'd like to know go get some of this guard to seal and let's have it

359
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:06,280
tested I'll bet you a hundred bucks right now it's got mercury in it I'll bet you it's got other

360
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,600
crap in there that they're not telling us let's have that shit tested show me that I don't trust the

361
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:16,760
government another link here all of these in the show notes a daily source code dot com

362
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:24,360
in July U.S. citizenship and immigration and immigration services quietly amended

363
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,640
it's list of required vaccinations for immigrants applying to become citizens one of the newest

364
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:41,000
requirements guardacil which vaccinate against HPV that's a money scheme but I truly believe

365
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,440
particularly when you hear about you know what's happened with they want to vaccinate Latin America

366
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:52,840
against German measles come on I don't trust that shit now the scariest one this is from the

367
00:39:52,840 --> 00:40:01,480
BBC this really freaked me out the body of an aristocrat who died nearly 90 years ago has been

368
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,960
exhumed in the hope that it will help scientists combat a future flu pandemic this is the bird flu

369
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,400
this is the next one this is where all their money is going to come from so this goes back to

370
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:19,240
Yorkshire landowner sir Mark Sykes who died in France in 1919 from the Spanish flu remember now

371
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:28,040
that they vaccinated and he here he's a picture of him with his uniform on they vaccinated all

372
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,080
these soldiers and there's a lot of literature about this and it's quite well known that you know

373
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:39,720
50 60 million people died from the Spanish flu but that it developed from these soldiers

374
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,480
having all kinds of shit injected to them and you can live with viruses but stress and poor

375
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,720
nutrition brings out viruses and that's when they can become lethal the scientists believe

376
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,760
this guy's remains will help piece together the DNA of the Spanish flu which could have similar

377
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:04,040
genetics structure to modern bird flu so it sounds like science but to me it feels like they just

378
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:14,360
needed a nice little sample so they could make this vaccine and let me see I love this let me see

379
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:25,240
I can find this part in this story his body will have to be examined in a special airtight

380
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:32,680
laboratory to avoid any risk of contamination the guy was buried in a lead coffin okay a lead

381
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:40,600
90 years ago which scientists hope preserve the virus so we're digging up the virus we're digging it up

382
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:47,240
so we can make a vaccine and then shoot it in everybody and God knows what that means

383
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:54,360
and I've been feeling this may become mandatory as well so I'm just suspicious okay I really am

384
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:59,400
suspicious I don't just take it for granted I go ahead just shoot something in my in my kids arm

385
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,560
without me knowing exactly what's in there who's doing the testing on this HPV I'd like some

386
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,240
independent studies to show me exactly what this vaccine contains okay

387
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:22,200

00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,160
Use your place to find the answer to this and any other hitist.

431
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,160
And to also find the links to iTunes, you can buy the tricks featured on the hitist online.

432
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
Okay.

433
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,160
Let's look for this hitist recorded with a Mac, which still takes a bit of getting used to.

434
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,160
But this one's been created with soundbites by Black Cat systems.

435
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,160
And it seems I've got it set up just right since I use all my needs.

436
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,160
I use it all the time.

437
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,160
For recording the hitist.

438
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,160
One more thing after a month of 15 months or so,

439
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,160
the hitist podcast is back.

440
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,160
Right on.

441
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,160
Which is my own personal podcast filled with audio stuff and things to hit.

442
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,160
That I have to do with switching from PC to Mac.

443
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,160
And also personal stuff that's been happening in my life lately.

444
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,160
So check it out at, well, the same address.

446
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,160
Alrighty Adam.

447
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,160
Thank you for playing everyone else.

448
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,160
Thank you for listening.

449
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,160
Next week I hope to be back with another hitist.

450
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
So until then, take care.

451
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,160
Have fun.

452
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,160
And remember, try to think with your hearts.

453
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,160
Bye-bye.

454
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,160
Be back.

455
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,160
If test at gmail.com info.

456
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,160
Yompholette.com.

457
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,160
And be OLDT.com.

458
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,160
Yo.

459
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,160
Thank you.

460
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,160
You're on for providing a nice little break there in the atmosphere.

461
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,160
And we got to Ray on the Charlie coming up as well with more musical goodness and

462
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,160
just wacky stuff, just to balance out the show.

463
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,160
Now, there's a couple of links here that I don't have time to discuss.

464
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,160
And just, of course, they're going to be in the show notes.

465
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,160
These are mainly BBC stories, but just stuff I want to bring to your attention because

466
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,160
it's important.

467
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,160
So you can follow those links if you want to in the show notes.

468
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,160
DataSourceco.com, curry.com.

469
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,160
Iran sending weapons to the Taliban.

470
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,160
That is very, it's just data points.

471
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,160
That's an interesting data point.

472
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,160
That could be an impetus to send tanks, which are there being brought in from the Ukraine

473
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,160
from Afghanistan to roll them into Iran.

474
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,160
I don't actually believe there will be a nuclear strike, by the way.

475
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,160
That's pretty much off the table as far as I'm concerned.

476
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:18,160
Now, the link here from the BBC, the IMF, approves the loan to help Georgia.

477
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,160
This, of course, is a scam.

478
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,160
This is how we get these small countries under control.

479
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,160
We don't actually give them money, but we lend them money.

480
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,160
It's just a little thing there in the database.

481
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,160
They have to then pay interest.

482
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,160
And it's primarily used because they don't get money.

483
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,160
That money is actually paid out to the weapons manufacturers in the United States.

484
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:44,160
Some of those around the world, all who, of course, have ties into the IMF and the World Bank.

485
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,160
So they send the weapons over.

486
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,160
And they say, OK, so we just sold you a couple tanks.

487
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,160
That's a couple million there off of your billion dollars that we've promised you.

488
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,160
And remember, you still got to pay interest if you don't pay the interest.

489
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,160
Well, then we're just going to take over your country.

490
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:03,160
And that means we get to take over where the pipelines are.

491
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,160
And we get to use your airfields and please don't default on that money.

492
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,160
Because we're going to have to come in and take over.

493
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,160
Is Ukraine's government has fallen on a part.

494
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:20,160
Only two days after Vice President Dick Cheney visited the Ukraine.

495
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:26,160
And it's truly a, it's crazy because it's a fight between the president.

496
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:32,160
Now, these guys had what they called just like Georgia had the Rose Revolution.

497
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,160
Ukraine, when they separated from Russia,

498
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,160
the Ukraine had the Orange Revolution.

499
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,160
And they have a coalition, which is a very familiar type of government.

500
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,160
So they have multiple parties.

501
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,160
And the president, it's really the president versus the prime minister.

502
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,160
The president, he wants to join NATO.

503
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,160
Now, if that, of course, is why Dick Cheney was hanging out with him.

504
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:00,160
Because he was hanging out with the president, not necessarily the prime minister.

505
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,160
And most of the country, as well known, does not want to join NATO.

506
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:09,160
Unfortunately, on the other side, we've got the prime minister.

507
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:18,160
And she wants to become a member of the European Union, which I don't think is a good thing either.

508
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,160
But it's interesting to see how Dick Cheney was there.

509
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,160
Two days later, shit falls apart, what's next?

510
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,160
Will it be some form of violence or how is that going to, how is that going to end?

511
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,160
And they also have a breakaway province where the Russians are handing out passports.

512
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,160
They fact similarly of what happened in Georgia.

513
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,160
So I'm just waiting to see.

514
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,160
Something's going to go on there.

515
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,160
It's another data point to keep your eye on.

516
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,160
Something crazy that goes beyond me.

517
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,160
I just didn't have the bandwidth to go into it and to read into it.

518
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:54,160
This kind of like Opus Day type of religious outfit called Legatus.

519
00:50:54,160 --> 00:51:01,160
And the title of this article is called How Legatus brought down Wall Street.

520
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,160
I think a gocker or maybe even Boeing Boeing posted on this.

521
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,160
But again, it was just too much.

522
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,160
My brain started to hurt when I was reading through it.

523
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,160
But I wanted to make sure you have it.

524
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:16,160
It's another important data point as we start to understand what is going around us.

525
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,160
As the veil is slowly lifted as the bars are widening of that invisible cage.

526
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,160
And we are starting to wake up.

527
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,160
Wake up people.

528
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,160
They work for us, but they don't know it.

529
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,160
And we're all being lied to.

530
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,160
We need to wake up and smell a coffee.

531
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:48,160
That I've been listening to to your show since about number 50.

532
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,160
So I've listened to a lot of your stuff.

533
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,160
Yeah.

534
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:59,160
And your rants and this and I got to say that lately I was beginning to wonder whether maybe you were kind of going crazy.

535
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,160
But I got to say that I want to congratulate you.

536
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,160
And I admire your courage and your willingness to stick your neck out.

537
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:13,160
So just a big thank you for my guy in Canada and keep up the great work.

538
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,160
No, no, man.

539
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,160
Thank you.

540
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,160
Thank you very much.

541
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,160
Everybody.

542
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:21,160
And I feel this so strongly now that people are waking up to multiple things.

543
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,160
They're waking up to 9.11.

544
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,160
They're waking up to the financial crisis.

545
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,160
They're waking up to vaccinations.

546
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,160
They're waking up to what's going on around them.

547
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,160
They're waking up to the cameras.

548
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,160
And they're making songs about it.

549
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,160
They're writing about it.

550
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,160
They're blogging about it.

551
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,160
They're making videos about it.

552
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,160
They're making poems about it.

553
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,160
Poetry.

554
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,160
Who thought I would ever give a shit about poetry?

555
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,160
And, uh, curry.

556
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,160
This is Brian Colin.

557
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:49,160
So I decided to start writing again.

558
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,160
And, um, you know, I wrote this poem.

559
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,160
Used to write a lot of poetry.

560
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,160
And, uh, I don't know, maybe you'll play it on your show.

561
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,160
Maybe not.

562
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,160
Or maybe you'll just read it and like it.

563
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,160
I don't know.

564
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,160
But it seems, you know, this is something maybe that I can do to help people.

565
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,160
I don't know.

566
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,160
But the aim of the poem is called, I'm awake.

567
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,160
All right.

568
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,160
A little nervous, but here it goes.

569
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,160
I'm awake to your master plan.

570
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,160
I see through your left right hypocrisy.

571
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,160
And my left are right.

572
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,160
I answer slowly.

573
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,160
I'm a human being on the small dot called earth.

574
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,160
First and foremost, I'm on to you.

575
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,160
I say, your fat tooth in.

576
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,160
This is in.

577
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,160
This is out.

578
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,160
By this.

579
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,160
Where this.

580
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,160
Your car is great.

581
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,160
Your floor.

582
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,160
I taste great.

583
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,160
I've cut your deceptive eyes.

584
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,160
Telling lies.

585
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,160
I'm on to your ways.

586
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,160
No more.

587
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,160
My numbing days.

588
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,160
I am free.

589
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,160
I say, god damn it.

590
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,160
I'm free.

591
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,160
You have my mind.

592
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,160
No more.

593
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,160
Checked in a paradigm of waste.

594
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,160
You can't stop me.

595
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,160
I can smile now and forever into the sun.

596
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,160
Stars, the moon and beyond.

597
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,160
I am alive now.

598
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,160
My ideas like prescription meds.

599
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,160
Take my reds and I will fill all your heads.

600
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,160
I'm your red pill dealer.

601
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,160
Your new age healer.

602
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,160
I've got your goodies galore.

603
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,160
It's truth.

604
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,160
And I've always got more and more.

605
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,160
I thought I was one, but I am many.

606
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,160
It's not me by far.

607
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,160
It's we the people.

608
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,160
Together strong.

609
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,160
Together I feel change.

610
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,160
We are all connected.

611
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,160
Every color, creed.

612
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,160
Man, woman, child.

613
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,160
We will create.

614
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,160
We will last.

615
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,160
Your plan has failed.

616
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,160
I'm sorry to say.

617
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,160
We have been awakened.

618
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,160
Yeah.

619
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,160
I don't know.

620
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,160
My palm.

621
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,160
I hope you enjoyed it.

622
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,160
Peace.

623
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,160
They work for us.

624
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,160
Are you kidding me?

625
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,160
Beautiful.

626
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,160
Absolutely stunning.

627
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,160
Thank you so much, my friend.

628
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,160
Chocolate heads.

629
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,160
This is what it's about.

630
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,160
It's just us.

631
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,160
And the more of us we bring in.

632
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,160
The better it gets.

633
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,160
We've got to wake people up.

634
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,160
We've got to let them know what's going on.

635
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,160
I want to slip in one little thing, which we have.

636
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,160
I don't talk about too much because, you know, there's already such a vast amount of

637
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,160
understanding to do just in the physical world.

638
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,160
Let alone the another dimension.

639
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,160
Yeah.

640
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,160
And this is a Ryan call for Massachusetts.

641
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,160
Hey, right.

642
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,160
I've been listening to your show for a while.

643
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,160
About a year or so.

644
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:22,160
And I just wanted to talk about the October 14 event that could possibly happen.

645
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,160
Yeah.

646
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,160
Now, is it October 14?

647
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:29,160
Is that where the Canadians are supposed to come first?

648
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,160
Yeah.

649
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:35,160
So this is the news and the word out that I've gotten through my channels is that.

650
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,160
And I'm so open for this.

651
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,160
The depletions.

652
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:45,160
We'll surface and make one of their enormous space crafts of visible.

653
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:48,160
It's supposed to be on October 14.

654
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:54,160
Now, could this be a total fabrication, just something I'd like to believe in?

655
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,160
Hell yeah.

656
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,160
Of course.

657
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,160
Of course.

658
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,160
I'm not saying that I know anything.

659
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,160
I never say I know anything.

660
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,160
I know a little bit about music and flying, but that's about it.

661
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,160
All the rest is just self-taught.

662
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,160
So who the hell knows?

663
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,160
But I've spent a fair amount of time.

664
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,160
And I heard about the October 14th pretty early on.

665
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,160
I talked about it on no agenda.

666
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,160
And it's just another data point.

667
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,160
I think we should keep our eyes open.

668
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,160
And particularly if something shows up and there's a lot of debunking and a lot of government

669
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:29,160
saying it's not true or even worse if the government says they're here to kill us.

670
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:35,160
Or if it's all just a big promotion for Keanu Reeves' new movie.

671
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,160
I don't know.

672
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,160
I do not know.

673
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,160
But I'm very open to it.

674
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,160
Very open to it.

675
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,160
Perhaps.

676
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,160
But I know, or is it a separate audience?

677
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,160
Didn't have to do it possibly the whole Billy Myers thing.

678
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,160
It happened about, I think, 20 years ago, 25 years ago.

679
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:00,160
The thing with Billy Myers that he predicted two or a half wars, which is rather interesting

680
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,160
because George Bush won, and George Bush won, and then George Bush won.

681
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:13,160
And then Bill Myers also talks about debating Iran, which I think will call it pretty close to you.

682
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:21,160
So I'm just wondering, do you think, you know, I really would like something to happen on the 14th.

683
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,160
You know what I mean?

684
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,160
I think it would be great.

685
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,160
I mean, I think that would really wake up a lot of people.

686
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:31,160
I guess I'm a little skeptic, but good on it.

687
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,160
You know what I mean?

688
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:38,160
You know, you say, you know, keep keep a, you know, keep, keep peace and love in your heart,

689
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,160
which I, you know, I think that's a, that's just a good mod of the live by general.

690
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:50,160
But anyways, I'll let the show, and take care, and they work for us, peace out.

691
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,160
I do indeed my friend.

692
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,160
And I have nothing but love in my heart.

693
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,160
You know, this is a big topic here in the curry manner.

694
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,160
I can't hate anybody.

695
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,160
I really can't.

696
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,160
It's, it's, it's leading my body.

697
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,160
I have no, uh, remorse.

698
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,160
I have no guilt.

699
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,160
I have no greed.

700
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,160
I have no envy.

701
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:15,160
Uh, that's really all that's left is love and creativity.

702
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:19,160
That's, uh, that's what I want to utilize in my remaining days.

703
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,160
God, I hope I have a whole bunch more.

704
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,160
I really do.

705
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,160
That'll be nice.

706
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,160
Okay.

707
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,160
So we're about two thirds the way through the list.

708
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:33,160
We got some really good songs and an article that I'm going to read to you,

709
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:38,160
which is really, really something for thought, and it's really heavy stuff.

710
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,160
So I want you to prepare for that.

711
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:46,160
But first, uh, well, we obviously have to do a little bit of light entertainment.

712
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:52,160
Um, my buddy Ray has been documenting my life in his series of Ray on the Charlie,

713
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,160
which is the soundtrack to my life.

714
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,160
I love it.

715
00:58:55,160 --> 00:59:00,160
That I do have a voice that, that is, of course, egotistical, but it's kind of nice because

716
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:05,160
the soundtrack to my life is a concept of everyone knowing exactly where they were,

717
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,160
what they were doing, and what feelings they have associated with the song.

718
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,160
And sometimes we share those soundtracks to our lives.

719
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:15,160
Sometimes in extremely different ways, but it's always fun to play the game.

720
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,160
All we want you tonight is Ray in good times.

721
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,160
My friends, good times.

722
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,160
Hope we've got to be a part of us against our name.

723
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,160
We'll talk to you.

724
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,160
I'm sorry.

725
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,160
I'm sorry.

726
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,160
I'm sorry.

727
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,160
The soundtrack to my life.

728
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:35,160
Well, let's take a look at the landscape on a road trip through your life.

729
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:39,160
This episode of Ed and Carys, the soundtrack to my life,

730
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:43,160
brings us back to 1988.

731
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:50,160
Ed was 24 years old, and lived with a lady Patricia and two house bats in New York City.

732
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:57,160
Most of it was wonderful time, living with a lot of your wife in the city of your ambition.

733
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,160
Ed was a VJ for MTV.

734
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:05,160
We also did radio work for the New York City Radio Station WHDC.

735
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,160
V100, New York, New York.

736
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:13,160
Oh, by the way, I almost forgot to tell you charcoal answered at 1988.

737
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,160
What's the year in which art, two little lot of words got married.

738
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:21,160
The fifth August, a road trip, driving drove around to block through just an hour.

739
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:26,160
To take a seat in the lady, P.S. and Mary, to couple, back to their apartment.

740
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:32,160
I'm talking to my baby on the telephone, all this done.

741
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,160
Okay, back to the job.

742
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,160
The soundtrack to my life.

743
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:41,160
During the years, Adam's image became more and more of that from the center of America.

744
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,160
Had metal dream, besides making some honor beards,

745
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,160
making music videos.

746
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:49,160
But MTV was also a host of the programs and English ball.

747
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,160
It's up to it to count down.

748
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,160
And most of all, modern, old, rock, and TV.

749
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,160
I just approved my two, my true leopard mania.

750
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,160
I brought in all of the 45s that I had.

751
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,160
My favorite one, of course, in cool for the V-sides is Armageddon,

752
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,160
which features stompers and maximists in the good old boys.

753
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,160
We released me on the V-sides.

754
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,160
Now, the deal is, we put all of these together.

755
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,160
Then you get the full album cover.

756
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:21,160
You know, maybe they should do this as a V-J test for audition in the future.

757
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,160
I don't know.

758
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,160
Phil Collins coming up with a leopard bite.

759
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,160
And so it was a stereo.

760
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,160
Soundtracks in my life.

761
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,160
Adam Cleared, you had a crush on the English Armageddon.

762
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,160
That old man broke Sheffield.

763
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,160
And formed in 1977 as a father.

764
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,160
We released me on the V-sides.

765
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,160
Adam Cleared, you had a crush.

766
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,160
Soundtracks in my life.

767
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,160
And it's a train that I won't be late to.

768
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,160
Night in 2018.

769
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,160
Adam coming up with a smile.

770
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,160
We made it up.

771
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,160
And no one can't.

772
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,160
You don't wanna make it up.

773
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:54,160
And now I'm holding with it.

774
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,160
When you made it up.

775
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,160
And you don't wanna make it up.

776
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,160
You got it.

777
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,160
Now you get me.

778
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,160
It's better than when we go.

779
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,160
Anything more to tell.

780
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,160
You know it's not fair.

781
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,160
Don't rock it.

782
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,160
You know you got it.

783
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,160
Now you get me.

784
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:32,160
We made it up.

785
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:36,160
We made it up.

786
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,160
We made it up.

787
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,160
We made it up.

805
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:50,520
married what we did right after you know we just went down to City Hall in New York City

806
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:54,360
got married now we actually witnessed to another couple's marriage because their

807
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:58,200
witness didn't show up. Steve Lease from MTV at the time now it's serious

808
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,080
satellite radio was our witness we just pulled them into the car and said

809
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:06,120
come on we'll have the car circle and we got married and that night we had dinner

810
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:11,800
in a very small Italian restaurant totally our Italian restaurant which kind of

811
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:17,400
makes you think about Billy Joel's song it was right there 56 and 7th I believe

812
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:22,440
if it's still there could be right in here to our apartment back in the day. Andrew Gold

813
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:28,440
yeah I mean the both of us being from the music business we have so many songs that we

814
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:33,240
share together that really mean something to us when it comes to nuttools though I'll say

815
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:40,760
although not necessarily from that song per se from that from our wedding day but more from our

816
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,960
tenth anniversary when we really had a party because we didn't have any part we didn't

817
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:48,360
many money you know we couldn't fly people in we waited until our tenth anniversary

818
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:53,400
and then we flew everybody and had a big a big party at I wasn't able to have a place

819
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,640
the manner the manner in New Jersey right near where we lived among Clair Barona

820
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:04,040
and Patricia had a jealous violin player two violin players and a jealous I think

821
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:10,120
and as we retook our vows and this was a surprise for me they played you in my heart

822
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:14,760
you're in my soul by Rod Stewart and then later she sang for me the man I love so those are

823
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:20,200
some of our songs associated with the soundtrack to our collective lives thanks Ray really appreciate

824
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:27,640
a man it's great to have this record I love it this record of my life sorry I didn't have anything

825
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:37,240
to blow my nose with okay I'm you know I'm really big on history and I was just talking about

826
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:42,600
this at lunch with the reporter who's doing a profile on me for an entrepreneurial magazine

827
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:50,280
that history has taught so poorly I feel and there was this this essay on what really happened

828
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:57,480
dot com called the Rise of the Fourth Reich which was so good and it really hit home so hard

829
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,320
that I wanted to share it with you and I actually just want to read it it doesn't have an author's

830
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:07,000
name so I'm going to suppose that it was written by the person who does the site I don't know who

831
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:11,880
it is but let me just read this to you and of course a link in the show notes that it's

832
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:16,920
source code dot com create dot com so you can re-read it at your leisure maybe send it to somebody

833
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:25,160
so here goes the Rise of the Fourth Reich everybody likes to say Hitler did this and Hitler did

834
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:31,720
that but the truth is Hitler did very little he was a world-class tyrant but the evil actually

835
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:37,320
done by the third Reich from the slave labor camps to World War II was all done by German

836
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:42,440
citizens who were afraid to question if what they were told by their government was the truth or

837
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:47,640
not and who because they did not want to admit to themselves that they were afraid to question

838
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:54,760
the government refused to see the truth behind the Reich's dot fire refused to see the invasion

839
01:07:54,760 --> 01:08:01,240
by fault by Poland as a staged fake which it was and followed Hitler into national disaster

840
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:08,600
the German people of the late 1930s imagined themselves to be brave they saw themselves as

841
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:15,160
the heroic Germans depicted by the Wagnerian operas the descendants of the fierce Germanic warriors

842
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:19,560
who had hunted wild boar with nothing but spears and who had defeated three of Rome's

843
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:26,040
mightiest legions in the Tutinburg forest but in truth by the 1930s the German people had

844
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:32,680
become civilized and tamed culturally obsessed with fine details in both science and society

845
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:39,960
their self image of bravery was both slave and slavery Germans were required to behave as if they

846
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:45,960
were brave even though they were not it's easy to look back and realize what a jerk Hitler was but

847
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:51,560
at the time Hitler looked pretty good to the German people with the help of the media he was

848
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:58,840
time magazines man of the year 1938 the German people assumed they were safe from a tyrant

849
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:03,160
they lived in republic after all with strict laws regarding what the government could and more

850
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:09,880
importantly could not do their leader was a devoutly religious man and it even sung with the

851
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:16,680
boys choir of a monastery in his youth the reality was that the German people as individuals had

852
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:22,760
lost their courage the German government preferred it that way as a fearful people are easier to

853
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:28,520
rule than a courageous one but the German people didn't wish to lose their self image of course

854
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:33,640
so when confronted with a situation demanding individual courage in the form of a government gone

855
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:40,040
wrong the German people simply pretended the situation did not exist and in that simple self

856
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:45,240
deception lay the ruin of an entire nation and the coming of the second world war

857
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:53,480
when the Reichstag burned down most Germans simply refused to believe suggestions that the fire had been

858
01:09:53,480 --> 01:10:00,440
staged by Hitler himself they were afraid to but so trapped were the Germans by their belief in their own

859
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:07,080
bravery that they wield themselves to be blind to the evidence before their very eyes so that they could

860
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:12,600
not an agreement with their furer while still imagining themselves to have courage even as they

861
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:19,160
avoided the one situation most required real courage to stand up to Hitler's lies and deception

862
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:27,960
when Hitler requested temporary extraordinary powers power specifically banned under German law

863
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:34,280
but powers Hitler exclaimed he needed to have to deal with the terrorists the German people having

864
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:40,680
sold their souls to their self delusions agreed the temporary powers were conferred and once

865
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:47,720
conferred lasted until Germany itself was destroyed when Hitler staged a phony invasion from

866
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:53,800
Poland the vast majority of the German people their self their own self image depended on continuing

867
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:59,480
blindness to Hitler's deception did not question why Poland would have done something so stupid

868
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:07,080
and they found themselves in a war but Hitler knew he ruled the nation of cowards and he knew he had

869
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:13,720
to spend the money to make the new war something cowards could fight and win he decorated his troops

870
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:19,880
with regalia to make them proud of themselves further trapping them in their self image Hitler copied

871
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:25,480
the parade regalia of ancient Rome to remind Germans of the defeat of the legions at the Twittenberg

872
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:31,880
forest talismans were added from Orthodox religions and the occult to fill the soldiers with delusions

873
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:37,880
of mythical strengths and an afterlife of the fell in battle finally knowing what it takes

874
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:43,720
that it takes courage to kill the enemy face to face Hitler spent vast sums of money on his

875
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:51,400
wonder weapons airplanes submarines ultra long rage artillery the world's first cruise missile

876
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:56,920
and the world's first guided missile weapons that could be used to kill at a distance so that

877
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,640
those doing the killing need not have to face up to the reality of what they were doing

878
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:07,800
the German people were lured into world war two not because they were brave

879
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:13,880
but because they were coward to want it to be seen as brave and found that shooting long-range weapons

880
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:18,840
at people or they could you know they couldn't see them so it took less courage than standing up to Hitler

881
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:25,080
sent into battle by that false image of courage the Germans were dependent on their wonder weapons

882
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:32,040
when the wonder weapons stop working the Germans lost the war i remember as a child listening

883
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:37,880
to the stories of world war two from my grandfather and my uncles would served in Europe i wondered

884
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:43,160
how the German people could have been so stupid to his even elected Hitler the dog catcher

885
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:50,120
let alone leader of the nation such is the clarity of historical hindsight and with that clarity

886
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:56,840
i see the exact same mechanism that Hitler used at work here in this nation the american people

887
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:02,840
imagine themselves to be brave they see themselves as the heroic americans depicted by western

888
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:08,440
movies the descendants of the fierce patriot warriors who had tamed the frontier and defeated the

889
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:14,680
might of the British empire but in truth by the dawn of the third millennium the american

890
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:20,520
people have become civilized and tamed culturally obsessed with fine details in both science and

891
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:27,640
society their self image of bravery is both slave and slavery americans are required to behave as

892
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:34,280
if they are brave even when they are not the american people assume they are safe they live in a

893
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:39,320
republic after all with strict laws regarding what the government can and more importantly cannot do

894
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:46,200
their leader is a devoutly religious man the reality is that the american people as individuals

895
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:52,440
have lost their courage the government prefers that way as a fearful people are easier to rule than

896
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:58,440
a courageous one but americans don't wish to lose their self image of courage so when confronted

897
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:03,480
with a situation demanding courage in the form of a government gone wrong the american people simply

898
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:11,640
pretend the situation does not exist when the world trade towers collapsed most americans simply

899
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:17,640
refuse to believe suggestions that the attacks had been staged by parties working for the US government

900
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:24,840
itself americans were afraid to even as news reports surface proving that the US government had

901
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:30,760
announced plans for the image of a Afghanistan early in the year plans into which the attacks

902
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:36,440
on the world trade towers which angered the american people into support of the already planned war

903
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:44,040
fit entirely too conveniently but so trapped our americans by their belief in their own bravery

904
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:49,400
that they will themselves they will themselves to be blind to the evidence before their eyes

905
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:55,160
so that they can not an agreement with the government must illimaging themselves to have courage

906
01:14:55,240 --> 01:15:01,640
even as they avoid the one situation which most requires real courage to stand up to the government's

907
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:08,840
lies and exceptions the vast majority of the american people to them their own self image

908
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:14,360
depended on continuing blindness to the government's exceptions never questions why Afghanistan

909
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:20,760
would have done something so stupid as to attack the united states and as a result

910
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:27,400
americans find themselves in the war now the US government has requested temporary extraordinary

911
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:32,520
powers power specifically banned under constitutional law but powers the government is claiming they

912
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:38,520
need to have to deal with the terrorists the american people having already sold their souls to their

913
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:43,880
self delusions are agreeing the temporary powers recently conferred will be no more temporary in

914
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:50,200
america than they were in germany the US government knows they rule a nation of cowards the

915
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:56,040
government has had to spend the money to make the new war something cowards confite the government

916
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:00,840
has decorated the troops with a galea to make them proud of themselves further trapping them in their

917
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:05,720
self image talismans are added from orthodox religions and the occult to fill the soldiers with

918
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:10,360
delusions of mythical strengths that an afterlife if they fall in battle and finally knowing

919
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:14,520
that it takes courage to kill the enemy face to face the united gut knights says government

920
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:21,080
has spent vast sums of money on wonder weapons airplane submarines ultra long range artillery

921
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:26,920
cruise missiles guided missiles weapons is a kill at a distance so that those doing the killing

922
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:32,600
need not have to face the reality of what they're doing as i mentioned above Hitler was time

923
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:39,640
magazines man of the year in 1938 stolen was time magazines man of the year for 1939 and 1942

924
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:46,360
both of these men and many others also celebrated by the media were unimaginable monsters

925
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:53,320
the lesson from these facts is that it isn't easy to spot a genocidal tyrant when you live with one

926
01:16:53,320 --> 01:17:00,440
especially one from the press sports the press supports and promotes tyrants become obvious

927
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:07,160
only when looking back after they have done becomes known the German people did not stand

928
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:11,960
up to Hitler because their media betrayed them just as the american media is betraying the american

929
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:19,160
people by willingly voluntarily even proudly abandoning its traditional role as watchdog against

930
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:25,640
government abuse it is the very nature of power that it attracts the sort of people who should not

931
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:31,320
the united states is the world's last superpower is a prize that attracts men and women

932
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:37,240
willingly to do absolutely anything to win that power and hence are also willing to do absolutely

933
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:43,000
anything with that power once they have it if one thinks about it long enough one will realize that

934
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:50,680
all tyrants past and most especially present must use deception of their population to initiate a war

935
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:56,840
no citizen of a modern industrialized nation will send their children off to die in a war

936
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:03,240
to grab another nation's resources and assets yet resources and assets are what all wars are

937
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:10,200
fought over the nation that wishes to initiate a war of conquest must create the illusion of an attack

938
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:16,680
or a threat to start a war and must always give their population of powers and excuse never

939
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:24,440
to question that carefully crafted illusion it is naive not to mention racist to assume that tyrants

940
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:30,120
appear only in other nations and that somehow America is immune simply because well we're Americans

941
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:37,240
America has escaped the clutches of a dictatorship thus far only through the efforts of those citizens

942
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:42,840
who unlike the Germans of the 1930s have the moral Kurds to stand up and point out where the

943
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:49,480
government is lying to the people unless more Americans are willing to have that kind of individual

944
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:55,640
courage future generations may well look back on the American people with the same harshness of

945
01:18:55,640 --> 01:19:02,520
judgment which we look back on the 1930s Germans I hack the Pentagon for self-incriminating evidence

946
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:07,880
of Republican manufactured white powder pestilence marine core flat vest with the guns and

947
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:14,120
ammo spitting bars like a demon stuck inside a piano turn a symbol into a soldier with just one

948
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:19,560
line so here's the truth about the system that a of your mind they gave out kind of six billion

949
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:27,080
dollars in 1989 and 1992 and now the last chapters of revelations are coming true and I know a lot of

950
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:32,760
people find it hard to follow this because the blame in no bigotry makes to hate my politics but

951
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:38,520
like America wasn't destroyed to buildings in a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our

952
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:43,560
children I was watching the towers and though I wasn't the closest I saw them crumble to the earth

953
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:48,040
like they were full of explosives and they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did

954
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:54,040
about the bombs planted on the George Washington Bridge for non-Arab's arrested during the emergency

955
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:59,400
and then it disappeared from the news permanently they dubbed the tape of Osama and they said it was

956
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:05,080
proof jealous of our freedom I can't believe you bought that excuse rocking a motherfucking flag

957
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:11,880
don't make you a hero the devil crept in the heaven go over slept on the seventh the new world

958
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:17,800
order was born on September 11 and just so conservatives don't take it the heart I don't think

959
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:22,200
bush did it why because he isn't that smart just a stupid puppet taking orders on a

960
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:29,480
the same people are sending a well stone the military industry got it popping and locking

961
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:34,680
looking for a way to justify the wolf with doctrine as a matter of fact rums fell now that I think

962
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:40,360
back without 9-11 you couldn't have a war in Iraq or a defense budget of world conquest

963
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:46,040
proportions kill freedom of speech and revoked the right to abortion acts kind of extortion

964
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:50,840
a blessing to the wealthy and wicked but you still have to enter to the arm again you scripted

965
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:55,320
and dick chain you fucking leech why don't you tell him your plans about putting your

966
01:20:55,320 --> 01:21:00,040
pipelines through afghanistan how is Rayleigh troops train oh my god

967
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:05,080
Pakistan you might have some house niggas fooled but I understand colonialism

968
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:10,680
it's sponsored by corporations that's why haliburton gets paid to rebuild nations tell me

969
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:16,360
the truth I don't scare into paralysis I know the CIA so I've been Latin on dialysis

970
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:21,560
and 98 when he was top 10 for the FBI government ties is really what a government

971
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:26,440
life read it just felt instead of asking a government why because then the course of death

972
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:33,960
the course the propaganda that it died and all the way around the world is not playing the mighty

973
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:09,240
for mine and take up a deep breath my lungs still took a pass if you've got to be a good day

974
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:14,280
because it has to be stretched out my arms I say a lot my worries you've been aided

975
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:19,560
you'll end with the possibilities these are mine it feels a bloodline never so they come

976
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:25,320
hold as I swing from the bottom of the sun with time a finally feel fine days as it should be

977
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:29,960
of my own design there's no one on like me to when I'll rest sleep and dream mine to

978
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:35,560
continue with them so all that I need nine to the bad day and a hundred to be because you can't

979
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:41,240
have a good day unless you believe every day good and bad will be around for us focus on

980
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:51,240
the lessons of the politics sounds over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over

981
01:22:51,240 --> 01:23:07,240
and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over

982
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:13,240
and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over

983
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:26,200
all the fact that we are here yeah that day I'll come to you

984
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:32,440
you think the sun finds a little rising long shadows stretch out the brisk air flies in

985
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:38,280
I think we're in the pool cool the conversation concepts in the moment meditation though

986
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:43,400
old days playing back in my mind the whole of people and the faces in the moment at time so

987
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:48,760
well we're in smiles all the small in the misery so I find tomorrow all this become history

988
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:54,520
and we're to pop it in the mind before the war the artists know the stars oh the sunlight's a darkness

989
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:59,240
could be the dumbest ending in computer smartness and about respect between the ghost and the

990
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:04,680
fantasy I've been former in the season of the harborships on the soul of seats and they were the

991
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:09,400
hardest now and everything really bad will be a powerful answer for the song this will be the

992
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:15,080
song

993
01:24:39,400 --> 01:25:09,400
Oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man, oh my man

you in the next video,

998
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,400
comment from our buddy, Russ and Washington.

999
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:15,400
Hey, Curry, Russ and a lot of people.

1000
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:19,400
I just have to say one thing boss of us are holding nine and seven

1001
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,400
truth or stuff.

1002
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,400
All right.

1003
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:26,400
I'll admit, the government reports on the glass of the

1004
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:29,400
world trade center and, you know,

1005
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,400
and all that stuff, yeah, sounds like bunk.

1006
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:35,400
Yeah, that would be the 9-11 commission report.

1007
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,400
Really?

1008
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,400
I don't know.

1009
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:39,400
You know, have your right.

1010
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:42,400
But one thing I have to say here, boss, is

1011
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:47,400
you don't need to melt steel in order for steel to fail.

1012
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:51,400
You'll lose a lot of it, Frank,

1013
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:55,400
after being heated to some amount of degrees.

1014
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,400
I wouldn't say I'm sitting in my work club right now.

1015
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,400
So I can't just look it up online.

1016
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,400
But you don't need to melt steel.

1017
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,400
They want to do it in the term melt.

1018
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:09,400
It is completely overlooking the fact that you can heat up

1019
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:12,400
steel to a degree with both melt.

1020
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,400
But it will fail.

1021
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,400
And that's one of the things you see that.

1022
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,400
These truthers need to get to their head,

1023
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,400
that if you're still going to argue,

1024
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,400
that'd be food and they'll come down this way.

1025
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,400
And again, you know,

1026
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:25,400
I've read the report that they've come out.

1027
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,400
It sounds like a bunch of B.S.

1028
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,400
But again, you don't need to melt steel.

1029
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,400
So on that regard,

1030
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,400
I want you to look into seeing what temperature

1031
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:39,400
steel does fail with a given weight at a given heat

1032
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:40,400
and temperature.

1033
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,400
So that's, I think, in those you guys,

1034
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,400
really need to look on,

1035
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,400
if you guys are sorry,

1036
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,400
if you guys are ever going to convince enough people

1037
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,400
that there's something to this conspiracy.

1038
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,400
Sure, there's a conspiracy.

1039
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,400
It's a conspiracy.

1040
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:57,400
It's probably too fucking incompetent to do anything about this.

1041
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,400
And now they're trying to cover their ass

1042
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:03,400
and, of course, like any bureaucracies doing a poor fucking job.

1043
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:06,400
I'll believe that long before I believe these 9-11 truthers

1044
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,400
because they're not arguing in the situation

1045
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11,400
and is sound and logical manner in my opinion.

1046
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,400
So if you guys are really going to start

1047
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,400
even with this subject,

1048
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,400
I have to look there and say,

1049
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,400
you don't need to, for example,

1050
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,400
melt steel in order for steel to collapse.

1051
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:23,400
And give me a situation where a burden

1052
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:27,400
of building burned uncontrollably for seven hours

1053
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,400
at any other point.

1054
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:33,400
It could have been that this type of scenario never happened before.

1055
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:36,400
So maybe we don't have a precedent to be set by

1056
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:40,400
all building fires in a steel environment

1057
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,400
have always had some type of retard in

1058
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:46,400
or, you know, fire response that's so holy.

1059
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:47,400
So again, you know,

1060
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,400
you're saying there's talking about situations

1061
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,400
really are unprecedented.

1062
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:55,400
And it's certainly not helping the American people

1063
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,400
in the government fucking up like they are

1064
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,400
and saying, oh, look at this.

1065
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,400
This is a possible explanation.

1066
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:04,400
Really anyone who has any type of experience

1067
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,400
knows it's a bunch of BS.

1068
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,400
So that's my rant for today, Ciri.

1069
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,400
I'm saying you're wrong.

1070
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,400
Not saying you're right.

1071
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,400
I'm just saying, if you're going to argue,

1072
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,400
argue on something a little more consistent

1073
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,400
and stop using these bullshit semantics like melt

1074
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,400
and realize that certain things don't need to melt

1075
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:20,400
in order to fail.

1076
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,400
Anyway,

1077
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,400
let's go back to you later.

1078
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:24,400
Great hair.

1079
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,400
Hope you win.

1080
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,400
They should work for us,

1081
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:28,400
but God knows they don't.

1082
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:31,400
So until you give me a better reason

1083
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,400
or you vote against my government,

1084
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:36,400
I'm the least going to have to vote in the election

1085
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,400
and it's a list of two evils,

1086
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,400
which one that is?

1087
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,400
Fuck if I know.

1088
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:41,400
Let's have you later, Ciri.

1089
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,400
Alright, Russ.

1090
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,400
Russ and Washington, everybody.

1091
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,400
Russ, I want to use that tremendous energy

1092
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,400
that I just heard there.

1093
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,400
And I want to direct it towards a theory

1094
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:55,400
of being investigating and it sounds absolutely nuts,

1095
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:59,400
but I do have some data points to back it up.

1096
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,400
So what I want you to do,

1097
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,400
this will be your homework.

1098
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,400
I want you to take your attention away

1099
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:10,400
from three buildings that collapse in free fall.

1100
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:13,400
World Trade Center, one World Trade Center,

1101
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:15,400
two and World Trade Center, seven,

1102
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,400
which mind you had no aircraft flying to it

1103
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,400
and still collapse in the exact same manner.

1104
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,400
And I would like you to focus your attention

1105
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:27,400
on World Trade Center building number six.

1106
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:31,400
But the only way you're going to see the evidence

1107
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:34,400
is if you search and I have links,

1108
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:37,400
but I want this to be something you go looking for yourself.

1109
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,400
Okay, I don't want to, you know,

1110
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,400
in fact, I'd probably say just go to fema.org

1111
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,400
and you can find these pictures,

1112
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,400
but I want you to do some of the research yourself.

1113
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,400
Take a look at building number six.

1114
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,400
If you look at it from the street level,

1115
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,400
you can see that there was,

1116
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,400
there was some damage,

1117
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:57,400
you can kind of see on the top as missing,

1118
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:00,400
and there's definitely damage to number six.

1119
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,400
And you would think that this is because of debris

1120
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:06,400
falling from towers one and two.

1121
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,400
Then I want you to find an aerial view,

1122
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,400
and you will see a huge hole

1123
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:15,400
in World Trade Center building number six.

1124
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:18,400
But this is not just a hole of debris that fell onto it.

1125
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:22,400
It's a hole all the way down to the ground,

1126
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,400
and there is no debris.

1127
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,400
Very much I'd like to add that there is no debris

1128
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:31,400
that even shows a tenth

1129
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:34,400
of either of any of the towers,

1130
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,400
certainly of one and two.

1131
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,400
Where is the debris?

1132
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,400
This was a huge building,

1133
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:43,400
and the only explanation of course

1134
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,400
is that it got pulverized,

1135
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:48,400
but even steel,

1136
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,400
there should be all kinds of wreckage,

1137
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,400
and that should be stories high,

1138
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:57,400
considering these buildings were over 100 stories tall themselves.

1139
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,400
Building six,

1140
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,400
let's say a whole bunch of buildings

1141
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:04,400
one and two fell on it and created this hole.

1142
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,400
They would have to be debris.

1143
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,400
But there is no debris.

1144
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,400
There's a hole all the way down to the ground.

1145
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,400
You can find shots from the inside of that hole

1146
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,400
in World Trade Center six,

1147
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,400
and you will see that there is,

1148
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:19,400
yes, there's debris,

1149
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:22,400
but no higher than a couple of feet.

1150
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:26,400
That does not constitute this huge hole

1151
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,400
that does not explain the hole,

1152
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:33,400
or many other 24 feet in diameter holes

1153
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,400
that you will start to notice and recognize

1154
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:40,400
if you look at an aerial view of what we call ground zero,

1155
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,400
being a big oh,

1156
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,400
we're a hole.

1157
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,400
One of the explanations,

1158
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:49,400
one of the data points that I've found for this,

1159
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,400
that you're gonna laugh at me

1160
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,400
because I've brought this up before.

1161
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:57,400
The correct term is directed energy weapon.

1162
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,400
Oh, I can hear you all say,

1163
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,400
oh man, here he goes again.

1164
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,400
But this is not a new concept

1165
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,400
to the United States government

1166
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,400
and the Department of Defense.

1167
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:12,400
In fact, most recently Bob Woodward

1168
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,400
has written in his new book

1169
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,400
that he's sworn to secrecy,

1170
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:19,400
but we have amazing super weapons,

1171
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,400
according to George Bush.

1172
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:24,400
Remember, this is what Hitler also said in the final days,

1173
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,400
you know, when he was going nuts

1174
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,400
and about ready to blow himself up in the bunker,

1175
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:29,400
oh, we have super weapons,

1176
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,400
we're gonna kill everybody with him.

1177
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:34,400
What is a directed energy weapon?

1178
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,400
It's like a microwave.

1179
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:40,400
And if you go ahead and you Google Project Blue Bean,

1180
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:45,400
or you Google Directed Energy Weapons,

1181
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:49,400
and you'll see plenty, plenty of stuff.

1182
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,400
US government material.

1183
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,400
And the proof is actually in the pudding

1184
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,400
as witness from this YouTube clip.

1185
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,400
I believe around 2003,

1186
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,400
Donald Rumsfeld was still the secretary of defense

1187
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,400
and he receives a very interesting question

1188
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:04,400
for one of the reporters

1189
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,400
during a Pentagon briefing.

1190
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,400
Listen very closely to the question.

1191
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:09,400
To the answer,

1192
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:12,400
and then it'll pass it off to some military official.

1193
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,400
And listen to what they're saying about the use

1194
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:17,400
of directed energy weapons,

1195
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:20,400
weapons that can pulverize material.

1196
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,400
Pulverize it.

1197
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,400
The question of some of the technology

1198
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,400
that you're developing to fight the war on terrorists,

1199
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,400
specifically directed energy

1200
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:31,400
and high-powered microwave technology.

1201
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:35,400
When do you envision that you can weaponize

1202
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:37,400
that kind of technology?

1203
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,400
Goodness.

1204
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,400
It is in, for the most part,

1205
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,400
the kinds of things you're talking about

1206
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,400
are in very early stages.

1207
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,400
Do you want to give anything you can?

1208
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,400
I don't think I've ever had much,

1209
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:54,400
I think they are in early stages

1210
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:59,400
and probably not ready for employment at this point.

1211
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:01,400
In the normal order of things,

1212
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:03,400
when you invest in research and development

1213
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:05,400
and begin the developmental project,

1214
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:08,400
you don't have any intention or expectations

1215
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,400
that one would use it.

1216
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,400
On the other hand, the real world

1217
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,400
intervenes from time to time

1218
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,400
and you reach in there

1219
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:16,400
and take something out

1220
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,400
that is still in a developmental stage

1221
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,400
and you might use it.

1222
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:23,400
So if your question is not answerable,

1223
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:26,400
it depends on what happens in the future

1224
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:28,400
and how well things move along the track

1225
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:31,400
and whether or not someone feels it's appropriate

1226
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,400
to reach into a development stage

1227
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,400
and see if something might be useful.

1228
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,400
As was the case with the unmanned aerial vehicles.

1229
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:39,400
What you know, you're going to experiment?

1230
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:40,400
I think that's the point.

1231
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:43,400
And I think we have, I think from the beginning

1232
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:44,400
of this conflict, I think General Frank

1233
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:47,400
has been very open to looking at new things

1234
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,400
if there are new things available

1235
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:52,400
and has been willing to put them into the fight

1236
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,400
even before they didn't fully run out.

1237
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,400
And I think that's not referring

1238
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,400
to these specific cases of directed energy

1239
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,400
or high-powered and microwave,

1240
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,400
but it's sure that will continue to do that.

1241
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,400
There you go.

1242
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:08,400
Directed energy, weapons, microwave weapons.

1243
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:09,400
We have them.

1244
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,400
We're not afraid to use them.

1245
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,400
When is the first time we use them?

1246
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:15,400
Who have we used them on?

1247
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:18,400
Time to do some research chuckleheads.

1248
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,400
Here's a song for my mom

1249
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,400

We the people here don't want war.

1257
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:51,400
Hey there Mr. Blackman, can you hear me?

1258
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:57,400
I don't want your diamonds or your game.

1259
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:03,400

700 million are listening.

1266
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:42,400
Most of what you read is made of lies.

1267
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:48,400
But speaking one to one, name it everybody's song.

1268
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:53,400

Tell me if the man who is bound up your land

1276

Now no doubt some folks enjoy doing battle.

01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:13,400
Black presidents, prime ministers and kings.

1283
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:20,400
So let's all build and show us where they can fight among themselves.
