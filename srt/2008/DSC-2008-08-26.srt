00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,240
It is August 26th, 2008. It's time for the Charley, gaining source code episode

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,000
number 785.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The next Charley's radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I like to think I'm flying to this jerk.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Everything is broken, everything is breaking down, breaking down.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Everything is broken, everything is breaking down, breaking down.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Everything is broken, everything is breaking down.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Everything is broken, everything is breaking down.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Everything is broken, everything is breaking down.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Everything is broken, everything is breaking down.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Everything is broken, everything is breaking down.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Everything is broken, everything is breaking down.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Everything is broken, everything is breaking down.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Everything is broken, everything is broken, everything is broken.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Everything is broken, everything is broken, everything is breaking down.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Everything is broken, everything is breaking down.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Everything is broken, everything is broken, everything is broken.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Everything is broken, everything is broken, everything is breaking down.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Everything is broken, everything is breaking down.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close

22
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,040
Gilford, G-Town on the West Side. Hey, how you doing? I hope you had a nice weekend for those of you in the UK, a bank holiday

23
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,880
Which means we all fucked off on Monday. I didn't I had stuff to do. I worked. I got busy

24
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,960
But it was and of course, I made a big mistake of putting the trash out today on Tuesday is normal

25
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,200
Get my ass out there at seven in the morning because we're first on the run and after my long walk

26
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,380
I try to take one every single day about what a long walk half an hour 45 minutes just to get out get some exercise have you know

27
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,380
basically movement and oxygen

28
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,380
You know when I listened to

29
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,760
Some some shows. Well, I listened to I listened to it today. I hadn't had listened to it yesterday

30
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:17,040
And they're the bags the trash bags are still there dammit. Now. I got I don't know if they're gonna come tomorrow or sometimes

31
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,560
They don't come for a whole week. Then you gotta wait until next week

32
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,760
And of course if I just leave them out there the animals will get into it anyway, who cares talking about politicians

33
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:33,880
Actually, I did have a pretty good weekend. I did some flying finally. I looked at the log book and I hadn't flown for almost two months

34
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,680
Which was kind of surprising

35
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,560
Wasn't the best of weather on Saturday? I was scheduled to go visit some people up in the north the very northern part of the Netherlands and

36
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,680
Roaning in

37
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,860
Elport of never been to before actually I've been there, but not certainly not solo and certainly not as a pilot and in command

38
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,240
And certainly not a use since I've had my flatless license

39
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,000
So I really didn't you know, it's kind of it's always kind of tricky when you go into a big airport that

40
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,880
Potentially has really big airplane to come in and out and you know, it's just unfamiliar territory, but it was fun

41
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,280
And

42
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,640
flew back yesterday

43
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,320
Which also wasn't just wasn't the best of weather all round. You know, we have a relatively low cloud base here in the UK

44
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,440
Man, I just wish I had two weeks two weeks. I could go to Portland within two weeks

45
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,800
I can finish my training for my

46
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,120
Instrument rating get the ticket and then be flying in a whole different airspace, but two weeks. You know, where am I gonna get it?

47
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,600
That's just not enough time in the day

48
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,760
Particularly since everything seems to be changing and moving so fast and all kinds of stuff happening

49
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
We're in the middle of the

50
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:47,160
The convention the democratic national convention out in Denver and I'm trying to follow what is best as possible

51
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,960
If it even on the way back in the Delta Sharia yesterday had BBC World on which I can get on six four eight AM

52
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,840
And we have a

53
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,120
Directional finder which is kind of the the World War II technology

54
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,720
Which will tune into that frequency so instead of in fact

55
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,200
I know exactly where the transmitter for the BBC was located because that's where that thing does is basically a needle

56
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:16,440
With a compass heading around it, which you can set and then you just tune into a frequency and the needle will point in the general direction of where the

57
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,200
Where the signal is coming from and it was of course kind of pointing towards London. I think yeah, yeah, it was pointing towards London

58
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,760
So I was listening to some of the coverage on the on BBC world, which is kind of cool

59
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,280
On the it's about about 45 minutes over the water and there's really nothing else going on

60
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,960
There's no one else up usually. There's no one else up there anywhere that I'm flying

61
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
That was kind of fun

62
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:50,680
So this is the daily source code where we specialize in aggregating aggravation everything source today from the drop data drop.io slash daily source code

63
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,600
Just sticking with the politicians theme for a second and of course all these links to be found either on the drop

64
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:03,720
Which you can subscribe to the RSS feed is a whole bunch of ways you can get to that or just go to the individual show notes a daily source code.com

65
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Look for today's episode 785

66
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,920
Also cross posted on curry dot com

67
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
So this came from Japan today

68
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,120
Which kind of blew me away

69
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,520
The story is they're quite well the claim is coming from a one-time

70
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,320
Manichi Shimbun journalist

71
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
Who

72
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Pooh was posted in Seoul

73
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,680
and says

74
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,680
North Korea's

75
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,880
Came John Ewe he died in 2003. He was replaced by a look like

76
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,600
Which now they think about it. I've never heard this guy talk

77
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,960
I don't I not that I can recall not that I would understand it

78
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,600
According to the stories actually, you know the the look alike the standin is actually two and a half inches taller

79
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:01,080
Then the original can you know the OG Kim Kim Jong-il. I think what I'll do is I'll send a note to Uncle Don and ask him if he's familiar with the story

80
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,720
And because he's met him and he's had many dealings with him and so he would know

81
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,240
So we'll see if we can debunk this story just thought it was pretty interesting that that that popped onto the radar screen

82
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,880
More political stuff

83
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,480
And probably because we talked with you know I've been talking about how messed up certain circles of

84
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,520
Government and justice and the police force really are and so here's the story

85
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:37,240
Xus diplomat who admitted taping his sexual encounters with teenage girls apparently some under the age of 16

86
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
While I was stationed in Brazil in the Congo

87
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,800
Was sentenced Friday to 20 years the maximum possible prison term

88
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,520
It's guys 42 is younger than I am

89
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,680
It's our leniency claiming a lot of the things that cultural differences in those countries made sex with teenage girls more acceptable

90
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,120
Okay, you know the guy clearly doesn't need to be in jail. He needs help

91
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,680
This is what always kills me about

92
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,640
About this situation, you know and obviously most people want to kill guys that do this

93
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,560
And maybe that is the only solution that we decide on as

94
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,920
As human beings and brothers and sisters that we should kill our ill and weak. I don't know if that's

95
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,320
the right

96
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
track

97
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:30,360
But certainly locking him up for 20 years is only gonna remove his problem from society for 20 years or until whenever he can get out on parole

98
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Kindies help

99
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,200
Let's see if there's anything about any any help while he's in jail

100
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,400
So of course the link to the story and in the show notes as usual

101
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,640
But it just kind of shows you know that more and more of these stories start bubbling to the top about politicians

102
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,680
And in this case, I don't know what was this guy. He was

103
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,800
Just says an XUS diplomat. Doesn't I can't find out what he was

104
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,360
Maybe some kind of ambassador type

105
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,120
And this kind of stuff. It just you hear more more about it and the real problem with it is

106
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,080
Outside of the obvious is that it makes these types of guys and

107
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,200
Women perhaps I wonder if it's only men who do this stuff. That's another question for you

108
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,360
It makes them you know susceptible to blackmail which only fox it up and makes the whole

109
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,480
rabbit hole deeper and brings in more of these people

110
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Psychopaths and ill people that

111
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,920
Well, we have to kind of I think we should make a uniform decision. What we do with people like this

112
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,920
But it seems like it's rampant among these circles

113
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
If that weren't crazy enough

114
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:44,040
This is I guess all 50 states in the US have what they call a safe haven law which means

115
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,000
And I didn't know about this until I read this story which is a story from the Huffington Post

116
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,080
Excuse me, which is probably cross posted from somewhere else

117
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:01,320
There's a safe haven law which allows parents to abandon and unwanted children at hospitals with no questions asked

118
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320
I didn't even know about that

119
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,200
And that by itself is certainly worthy of discussion and and troubling

120
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,520
But in Nebraska they and I don't know if this wasn't really intentional if someone didn't think about it

121
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,240
But it is interesting to note that the safe haven law for Nebraska

122
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:27,000
Um, goes beyond babies and the story says potentially permits the abandonment of anyone under 19

123
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,640
teenagers

124
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,640
Well now you're talking my language

125
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,240
I definitely would like to abandon my teenager from time to time

126
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,280
Who by the way turns 18 tomorrow big party here in G-town?

127
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,280
Oh god, where's the time gone

128
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,720
But the stories certainly things to be looked at and followed up on

129
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Just uh just crazy

130
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,840
Hey, I wanted to give you guys this since I got a lot of notes about this about my E71 in fact

131
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
It doesn't seem to be available everywhere

132
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,840
I must have been such a total fluke that I was able to pick this one up and what has it been now?

133
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,880
It's been almost a month ago. I think yeah it's been

134
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:10,120
Yeah about a month ago when I came back from from holiday and instead of buying the iPhone

135
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,440
I picked up the E71 from Nokia

136
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,080
I've been an E61 fan and of course

137
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,640
Actually, I've walked the entire upgrade path with Nokia. Have an eye I started with the a with the

138
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
E60

139
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,120
E61 I think and then the came the 61 eye yeah

140
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:32,040
So I wonder if there'll be a E71 eye if you're not familiar with it. Please take a look at this first of all

141
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,480
This thing it's sexy and it just feels right

142
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,440
It just feels really good in the palm of your hand

143
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,200
And I think I've mentioned in previous show all the things I like about it

144
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,320
There's and you know, just a couple of things I wanted to mention that I don't like about it

145
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:56,760
Really the tomb the the main feature that bugs me the most is the physician of the headset and the angle of the headset jack

146
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,120
So the actually the the headset jack on the phone itself is on the the top right not on the top

147
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,120
But on the right-hand side near the top

148
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,800
which is

149
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,920
Regardless of what kind of plug you put in there is not

150
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
groovy for

151
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,080
Portable use because you want to slip the phone into your pocket and

152
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:22,920
If it has something sticking out the side it's you know, it's either gonna catch on the on the side of your pocket or it's just it's uncomfortable

153
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,200
It just doesn't make any sense it should be on top or to be on the bottom so you can put you know the phone in your pocket upside down

154
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm sure there was just it's a lack of space or whatever it was but an ergonomic nightmare and then the

155
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,040
The headset itself has an angled plug which makes sense because it's coming out of the side

156
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,200
But that it catches on everything and you know it gets jerked out

157
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
It has one of those behind the head

158
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Special headphones

159
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,560
You know, so of course has a microphone built in and it has one long

160
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:00,200
So like the left the left ear wire is a shorter than the right ear wire because you're gonna wrap that around your neck

161
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:07,160
Which I actually kind of like that system so that you have the wire off to one side and not in the middle like like an iPod headphone

162
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:17,880
So that's okay, but just the combination of that that the hooked jack and and the headphone jack on the phone is is it's really irritating very very

163
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,760
dumb

164
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,120
Because I use it as you know as my iPod now and

165
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,360
And I love yeah, I love the the the podcast and client of course. I've loaded up my my mevio channel

166
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:37,720
The on the go channel in there and that you know that's fantastic. It seems like the the whole machine is just so fast compared to the

167
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:45,080
The 60 or the 61 the 61 I models and it seems to be some improvements to the software itself some extra features

168
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,360
Which of course is the simbian operating system

169
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,800
then the only other thing that is noticeable

170
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,720
if

171
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,960
And you know I like to typically I for some reason I like to close applications

172
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,200
I'm starting to learn how not to do that

173
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,680
But if you open up the address book and you have a large a number of addresses now

174
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't even have that many I'm looking right now. I have

175
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,920
764 addresses in my address book and firing up the address book

176
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Takes minutes

177
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,880
So you what you don't want to do is ever close that one out if you have a big address book

178
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,360
I don't know what it's doing. I don't know why it's it I've never seen it is the same address book I've used on

179
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:32,280
On the 61 and that had no problem. So it must be doing something parsing something figuring something out but

180
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,320
Extremely irritating and then

181
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,040
I think that's actually it that's those are the only the only things I don't really like what I haven't figured out as if

182
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,400
Since it has built in GPS if I can actually encode GPS information into the pictures I take with the

183
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,560
Lovely 3.2 megapixel auto focus camera with flash Yahoo, and that's still like the

184
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,040
Test out the the video calling feature which because it also has a little camera on the front

185
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:04,200
Which is probably a VGA camera, but I'd love to try that out. I just have no one to test it out with and and by the way

186
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,480
I don't have I don't actually get a 3G signal here at the house. I have to

187
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,760
Go off site so to speak

188
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,640
But otherwise still love on this device battery still unfricing believable

189
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,400
How good the battery life is of this thing so there you go

190
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,480
Love in it quite a bit

191
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,040
I wouldn't want to trade it in for an iPhone for anything which may sound kind of weird coming out of my mouth

192
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,520
But these days I'm just completely into functionality and wanted all to work

193
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,120
Uh

194
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,400
tracking the world finances as the

195
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,200
All of the Europeans oh the European all the central bankers got together

196
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,200
I think it's an annual thing they all hang out in Jackson Hole Wyoming

197
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,200
Excuse me those sippety there I've heard other things about other conferences taking place that I can't quite recall what it is

198
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,760
But they basically came out and said well yeah, it doesn't look too good and

199
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,960
Is a story here from CBC Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and it looks like you know

200
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:14,760
You can almost they're talking about taking bets on how long it's going to take for another bank to fail the Norwegian bank just failed the other day

201
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,120
The rock tealed we sound a lot like raw child to my to my ears

202
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,560
So the Norway Norwegian Central Bank had to step in there remember that you know all of the stuff this whole system is

203
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,480
As far as I can tell it's just coming apart at the seams you know by primarily by greed and

204
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,160
um

205
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,000
debt just too much a debt for the for the American system to handle and I think that's just spread

206
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,880
drastically throughout the rest of the world of course the

207
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,840
The mortgage crisis uh we went from subprime to the mortgage crisis now just the damn financial crisis

208
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,160
And everyone's got a theory on it, but at the end of the day it's the central banks including the federal reserve

209
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,760
Who are to blame because they're the ones that create the money so

210
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,680
Whether it was intentional or not whether they knew what they were doing or not it's it's coming from them

211
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,480
So the guy we got to look at them for for helping us out in in this mess or into this mess

212
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,680
Here's a couple of the high profile bankruptcies that already have taken place in 2008

213
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,200
I just want to say it again because we get so used to the word billion

214
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,600
And you only need a thousand billions to create a trillion and the US has nine trillion

215
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,760
I mean these numbers they they seem pretty outrageous and big, but after a while

216
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:39,320
He's just like a billion million trillion whatever, but you got to realize the the scope of this how how big this is

217
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:46,600
So in August we had first priority bank of Florida taken over by the FDIC after incurring significant loan losses

218
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,400
Of course July we had the 32 billion

219
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,640
Dollar failure of indie Mac bank of Pasadena, California

220
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,120
That'll cost the taxpayers in the US for or eight billion dollars

221
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,520
Of course in March JPMorgan Chase and company bought Bear Stearns, which was brokered by

222
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:13,320
The federal by the Fed by Bernanke and all kinds of loans are made available for that

223
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,520
And then of course we have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which is as far as I'm concerned are virtually bankrupt

224
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,960
And they've got at least half of of the 12 trillion dollar US mortgage market

225
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:31,160
And that's just the mortgage stuff that we're looking at you know what what you read very little about other than people pleading for

226
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:39,080
Transparency in the marketplace is these derivatives and you know if we have a I'd love for a financial

227
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:45,800
Subvant out there to call in and please do me a favor and and use the the phone line on the on the source code drop

228
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,160
You know there's a phone number there and then there's a pin code the after use please use that because that's just all in one place

229
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,120
I get everything from there. I've even changed the show notes to reflect that

230
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,080
To call in and leave a message explain to people what a what a

231
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,640
A default swap is something you know like a vanilla

232
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,960
Deal which I think is what most of these deals are I mean it's been explained to me

233
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,600
I understand that I'm not a good ex you know, I'm not good at explaining how it works

234
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,600
But consider that it's probably about four or five hundred thousand billion dollars

235
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:26,600
Which is five hundred trillion. Yeah, so something like that some astronomical amount of money which is or yeah

236
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,280
Money which has been swapped and traded but it's only maybe two or three percent is actually covered and

237
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,680
You know this is because you have two parties and there's those transparency as to if that party can actually pay

238
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:45,800
One you know when it's it's it's more credit stuff that is just vague and unclear and if that shit starts to unravel

239
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:52,040
Well, I think it could actually just fall apart. It really could big discussion with John city work about that

240
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,280
I don't know agenda he disagrees course

241
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,680
But it's just it's just it's just kind of freaking me out to see all that

242
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Again all of these stories sourced from

243
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,720
From your suggestions your links so

244
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,600
Either that's going to make everybody happy and make the audience very small or these stories are just

245
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:20,520
You know interesting stuff. It's all reports from mainstream news. That's why I'm saying aggregating the the aggregation maybe the aggression

246
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,600
Because this stuff never really floats to the top it just doesn't

247
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,160
Although I have seen this report around but no one's really fallen over themselves about New York City's new

248
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,800
High-tech defense perimeter which includes and this is this is nuts

249
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,160
If you haven't read about this again link in the show notes

250
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,760
16 million dollar plan. It's the LMSI the lower Manhattan security initiative

251
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,440
It's centerpiece an array of 3,000 cameras that will turn the entire area

252
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,840
Into a 1.7 square mile of observation deck

253
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,680
Let me read some of this for this funny and contrast to London surveillance system which we all know about

254
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,120
There's a several cameras per inhabitant of the city the so-called ring of steel

255
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,480
New York's cameras will do more than identify terrace after they struck the new cameras will be fully networked video

256
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,280
Intelligence algorithms that aim to spot potential attackers before they perpetrate their crimes

257
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,520
Wouldn't be used to track anybody would it

258
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Electronic license plate readers

259
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,560
New software can sound that alarm when it spots suspicious behavior like bags left on a platform truck circling

260
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,680
People entering a building through an exit

261
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,640
Please don't go up the down staircase

262
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,040
We truly truly are prisoners, aren't we?

263
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,200
And just and no one's complaining about this stuff maybe what they say about chem trails is true

264
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,320
You know, we're just completely numbed out and don't give a shit

265
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But

266
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,320
All right one more for you for our friends over here in the UK

267
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,800
I think I saw the store the story maybe it was even on the BBC

268
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,560
It was on news night or something but now it's hit the New York Times

269
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,400
So it's definitely an older story for those of us over here on the aisle

270
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,520
But it's basically about

271
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,160
Crete the island of Cretan grease and

272
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,560
That's where a lot of young Britons go to

273
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:40,200
Go to vacation. It's not just Greek there's a couple of but it's around the Greek islands, but also I beef Spain

274
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
You know couple different places

275
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,320
That that are reporting that you know the Britons

276
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:56,680
Well, yeah, I have the code for you. This is how how most foreign countries where the Brits go on holiday view

277
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,400
I'll just say us

278
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,440
They scream they sing they fall down. They take their clothes off. They cross dress. They vomit

279
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,520
It's only the British people not the Germans or the French. This is

280
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,880
Malia's mayor Malia, I guess is a town in Crete

281
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,600
That's nice. They scream they sing they fall down. They take their clothes off. They cross dress and they vomit

282
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,720
Yeah some statistics for you

283
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,160
British behavior abroad is the British Foreign Office as reports 12 month period

284
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,520
2006 and 2007 six hundred and two Britons were hospitalized 28 raped in Greece alone

285
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,240
1,591 died in Spain died

286
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,400
1500 people died in a years time

287
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,640
Jesus

288
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
2,032 were arrested

289
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,520
Does anyone else see that this is an issue

290
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,480
And and I'm telling it's because

291
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:04,360
What happened to the thin white dupe type Brit who you know would stand up to his government?

292
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:11,160
I know Margaret Thatcher broke the unions and and and and the minors, but I'm still looking for that spark where is it?

293
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,520
Where's the you know all we're doing is just getting hammered and

294
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
cross dressing and puking

295
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,640
and it's just the complete

296
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,160
Numbing of our of our consciousness

297
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,280
This is just not okay and definitely not good

298
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
It's the youth of the nation

299
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,840
TOD a source code favorite

300
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:02,200
Let's stay on the rest of my life

301
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,680
I wish I wouldn't know cuz I didn't kiss my mama goodbye

302
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,400
I didn't tell that a love there how much I can't a thing

303
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,640
I'm off to all the talks and all the wisdom we share

304
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,640
Where I just did what I always do every day to stay with team for us

305
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,600
Get up to school but who knows that this day wasn't like the

306
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,320
Wrapped instead of taking the test off to cooler the chat

307
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,000
Call me by my dad to see it come and everybody was running

308
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
but I couldn't hear nothing except

309
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Don't lose and you have to so fast

310
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I didn't really know this day to rise apart

311
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,960
Class maybe this kid was reaching out for love

312
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,440
Or maybe for one money he forgot who he was

313
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,760
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be her

314
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,720
Whatever it was I know it was because

315
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,200
We'll be our

316
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

317
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

318
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

319
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

320
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

321
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
We'll be our

322
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

323
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

324
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

325
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

326
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

327
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

328
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

329
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

330
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

331
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

332
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

333
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

334
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

335
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

336
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

337
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,440
We'll be sure

338
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

339
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

340
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

341
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

342
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

343
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
We'll be sure we'll be

344
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
We'll be sure we'll be

345
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
We'll be sure we'll be our

346
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
We'll be sure we'll be

347
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
We know we are, we know, you're the nation.

348
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Who's the blame for the life that drags this claim?

349
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
No matter what you say, it'll take away the pain that...

350
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
...and that I feel the side of time to mobilize...

351
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
...or nobody, nobody's the blame, we need a cryer.

352
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You said the way that the story goes, will it ever make sense?

353
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Somebody's got to know, just gotta be more to light than this.

354
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Just gotta be more to everything I thought exists.

355
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
We are the eye.

356
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
We are the nation, we are the we are.

357
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You're the nation, we are the we are.

358
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
We are the we are.

359
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
We are the we are, we are the we are.

360
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Drinking ourselves to death.

361
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Entertaining ourselves to death.

362
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Eating ourselves to death.

363
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
As right?

364
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
We are the youth of the nation.

365
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Now to my talking about, I'm almost 44. Next week.

366
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That's playable on death.

367
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I like that.

368
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Some reason a lot of, I'm into a lot of like real heavy, heavy music lately.

369
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But we do have some other stuff coming up on today's show as well.

370
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And I'm pretty sure it's going to be another show that's over now.

371
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I think I can kind of handle this or at least the vibe I'm in right now as we aggregate aggravation.

372
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Maybe aggravate aggression.

373
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It seems like I can do two shows a week with the rest of the schedule.

374
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I'm still on early mornings and early mornings for the Dutch stuff and late nights for San Francisco.

375
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So I don't know, but my asthma elbow as we would say.

376
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You know, and I'm a man pissed off because, I guess as I said was the bank holiday.

377
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So I knew it wouldn't have kicked off, but today we kick off a special promotion in the UK.

378
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We now have, and I'm very proud to announce, go daddy.co.uk,

379
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
which has pricing and pounds.

380
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And in addition to that, you can get.co.uk domain names.

381
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's cheaper than in, I mean, by far cheaper than anything else that's being sold here in the United Kingdom.

382
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But I didn't get my special code.

383
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Of course, I have DSC 1, DSC 2, DSC 3 for go daddy.com for dot com dot net dot org etc.

384
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
But not for dot code at UK.

385
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So do me a favor.

386
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Check out your favorite other brick, brick castor, brick podcaster.

387
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Get their code. If you're going to buy a dot code at UK domain name, use their code.

388
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I think we're down to like, it's somewhere like £3.50 or something.

389
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It's literally like the $6.95 in the state to get for dot com address.

390
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I think it's the equivalent of that in pounds here in the UK.

391
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So the best deal better than any other dot code.uk domain name deal.

392
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
If you find something better, let me know immediately.

393
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I'm sure the good folks are go daddy will go out and top that.

394
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So very proud to be supporting go daddy in their UK rollout.

395
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You know, I've obviously, you've seen me shift.

396
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm used for those of you been around for seven hundred seven hundred eighty five episodes.

397
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Clearly you've witnessed a lot of transformation of myself moving from.

398
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Interested in technology to somewhat trivial to podsafe music.

399
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
All the way through to where I am now, which is is much more than just what I'm doing with me.

400
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
What I'm doing with with the source code, but really what I'm doing in life, I guess, and that must be.

401
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm sure it has something to do with my age and where I'm at right now.

402
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
But I've pretty much decided that I really have to remain very open for all kinds of possibilities of things.

403
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And that, of course, was a big part of the awakening show seven eighty one.

404
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Because this can't be all there is.

405
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And you know, that I just don't accept.

406
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And of course, with a lot of things I've been talking about.

407
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
There's been some, you know, a good amount of ridicule, which, you know, was to be expected and I'm definitely careful at how I am.

408
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
At how I phrase things and, you know, I think the chuckle heads out there, you know, no one I'm talking about.

409
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
But when it comes to.

410
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Some alternative beliefs, like, well, like, 2012, there you go.

411
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
This is a big one. This is the number you see everywhere. It's the Mayans, the Mayan calendar ending. It's a so much information.

412
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And there's been information about this for thousands of years because they basically wrote it that long ago.

413
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But now comes an interesting twist to all of this or at twist something, just interesting.

414
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
This is from National Geographic, a lab earth filled with stone temples and pyramids and 14 caves.

415
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Some of them underwater has been uncovered of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.

416
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And they announced this just last week. This is exciting stuff because, you know, if you're, if you're into this and you're into the concept that we are all just brothers and sisters of the galaxy and that there's a lot more out there and that we just haven't transformed into the dimension where we can actually see what else is around us.

417
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Instead of this reality, which has been created and carefully maintained for us primarily by the news media.

418
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:47,000
When something like this comes along, that seems like big news to me and I'm quite surprised, frankly, that I hadn't heard about it until, of course, the trusty drop came along.

419
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:59,000
According to my and myth, the souls of the dead had to follow a dog with night vision on a horrific and watery path and endure myriad challenges before they could rest in the afterlife.

420
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Sounds like Indiana Jones.

421
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,000
In one of the recently found caves, researchers discovered a nearly 300-foot concrete road that ends at a column standing in front of a body of water.

422
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
This is cool, man. Any more info on this stuff.

423
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Hit the drop with it because it's, is it just coincidence? Is it all just kind of coming together at the same time? I don't know.

424
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,000
What I will say, and, and I hadn't really, I've never really looked at crop circles too much because, you know, I have cares.

425
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And of course, I'd been kind of hit with a meme that, well, you know, those original crop circles, you know, some college students did it or whatever.

426
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And then I found this site called cropcircleconnector.com, and just go take a look at this site.

427
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And, and, and, and they track crop circles throughout the world. And very interesting is that if I just look at their tally here, um, the world worldwide, they've got 50.

428
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I don't know when they started doing this. I, crop circles, 2008. Okay.

429
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So 50 in this year so far around the world, which haven't looked at yet because my eye was immediately drawn to the 65 for the UK alone.

430
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And you look at these crop circles. And this is, you know, this is not just circles. This is like really major, uh, geonomic shit geometric shit, which is just, and, and many cases, phenomenally beautiful.

431
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And a lot of them seem to be located in a wheelchair for some reason. Oops. Hold on. That actually, you're probably not here in that, but it started up some music. I didn't want to do that.

432
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Um, so in, uh, and, and like every single day, there's a new one almost every single day. And here's what I like about crop circles.

433
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Because it fits right in with 9-11. You know, if you even, um, broke the topic of 9-11 with someone saying, hey, you know, it seems like there was a lot going on there.

434
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Some people must have been of all, somebody must have known something. What you normally get is that's impossible. Someone would have had, well, someone would have come out and said something by now.

435
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:16,000
That's so big a secret. You cannot keep it in, uh, it just cannot be kept quiet. Someone would have to, that talk about it sooner or later.

436
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Okay. So I'll accept that. But then you have to kind of say the same would be true for crop circles. Because these things are so intricate, so huge. So many of them that if it's actually done by people hoaxing, first of all, I'd hire them for an architectural firm which had start tomorrow because they really has some awesome design sense.

437
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Um, the same has to hold true. Well, then, you know, so many people would have to know about this. And of course, it would be college kids that someone would eventually have to say, yeah, I did it.

438
00:36:49,000 --> 00:37:05,000
We all know about the two old guys who claim that they did, uh, that they would do in crop circles for 13 years, but they're not doing to a day. Every single day. It's just, it's amazing. And some, and, and the symbols, who does it? How knows what they mean?

439
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Well, I think that just like, it's some thing or someone or some energy, just send and shit to make us happy. Just saying, hey, we're here. Take a look at this. Here's another beautiful drawing for you.

440
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah, crop circle connector.com fantastic. And again, I'm just bringing that up because it makes so much sense, uh, if you, if you want to say that 911 could have been an inside job, then there's the same holds true for this.

441
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:50,000
You know, this can't be an inside job or a fakeery because too many people would know about it and too many people would be talking about it. Interesting know that you, I mean, considering that certainly in the UK, where they do love a, you know, a good scandal or something wacky or some UFO stuff.

442
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:07,000
This year's scale of how many of these things are being created is certainly not being reported in mainstream media mainstream media primarily the big ones, of course, owned by a Rupert Murdoch here in the UK, which reminds me actually this story that I'll talk about that a little bit later on.

443
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:19,000
So there's one other thing that I do want you to take a look at, since this was left on the drop. If you want to learn more about the Mayans, what the significance of these caves might be, but really about the transformation.

444
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The transformation that is being talked about about the earth and there a lot of this is is well known, you know, there's an increased son activity every 11 years.

445
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,000
That's was been taking place for the probably the past 70 years has been more than the more son activity than ever.

446
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:46,000
But it literally as far as I understand it will affect the magnetic energy of the of the poles and we're not talking about the guys with the missiles near Russia.

447
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And, you know, there's all these different things that are supposed to happen.

448
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And what I'm doing just personally is I'm trying to get a little bit more in contact with as corny as it sounds.

449
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:09,000
With nature, with mother earth trying to reconnect a little bit trying to open myself up to a possibility of anything else that might come our way.

450
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And I was given some advice to try and sync up with the I think it's called the human resonance.

451
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So this is a frequency and I've heard of this because I think in, I think one of my helicopter books that actually talks about the human resonance because which is a I think it's seven hertz seven.

452
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And they talk about the ground loop effect.

453
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:45,000
If you, if you're on one skid or you lift off on one skid and can't exactly, I've never, I've never, it's never happened to me.

454
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But if you pull too much power or you actually, you put it into the exactly the right RPM the rotor.

455
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,000
The ground loop will occur, so then you've got not made, maybe it's seven hundred RPM who knows I should look it up again.

456
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Then it starts to interact with the, with the actual resonance of the earth and then basically what happens is the helicopter spins around tips over and it's a day record.

457
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So what I'm from what I understand the resonance this seven hertz is actually elevating in some spots and is moving up to 10, 11 and some places even 12 hertz.

458
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And so I'm trying to connect to that and actually try that with, with the audience on the Dutch show on arrow classic rock the other morning.

459
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Then you know, here's what you should try, so I'd like you chuckle heads to give it a go.

460
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You know, whenever, whenever you're the opportunity, when you have some time to just chill out for five or ten minutes, just sit on a chair or lay down whatever makes it feel comfortable.

461
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Basically, try and put both of your feet flat on the ground.

462
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I think if you do this on the ground floor, it's probably best, but it shouldn't make any difference.

463
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Visualize that you are literally shooting root through the bottom of your feet down into the earth and trying connect with this seven hertz vibration, this energy.

464
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And try and channel that just in your imagination up through your feet through your legs, you know, the bottom half your legs up through your thighs up through your, your groin area, which is essentially your lower chakra.

465
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And this is not shit. I'm just making up, you know, it's been around for a long time. I think people used to actually learn about chocros and school. We don't do any of that anymore.

466
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And see if you can move that energy up higher. And things start to happen. You certainly feel very rested, a lot of people fall asleep.

467
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:52,000
But three people after trying this only once, three people saw things in the night sky, which they could not identify, which was highly interesting to me. So I'm, I'll do that. I can take five minutes a day and do that.

468
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And I think you chuckle heads, you just might want to give it a shot as well.

469
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
How are we doing on time? Because I got about half a list left of stuff.

470
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Well, 42 minutes. Okay. Let's move along.

471
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Another link for you to check out referring back to to 9.11.

472
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:19,000
This is, you know, we've talked about, you know, really how mainstream works perfectly well with independent media, but more in editorial function.

473
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Because there are some great journalists doing some great journalistic work in mainstream media, but either they're not placed poorly placed or, or just filtered out.

474
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And if there's not enough of, of quote, fact about something, it just doesn't make it into the mainstream consciousness.

475
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So this is the highly credible people who question 9.11 blog 9.11 summary dot blog spot dot com. I'm not going to go through this whole list.

476
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:57,000
But it, it starts right off with the co-chairs of the 9.11 commission said that the 9.11 commissioners new military officials misrepresented the facts to the commission and the commission considered recommending criminal charges for such false statements.

477
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It's a mainstream media article on the Washington Post dot com. That's just the top one.

478
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Give that a look. It's in the show notes a daily source code dot com.

479
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And then this thing.

480
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
This really, uh, this really freaked me out when I heard this.

481
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I did want to share it with you. And I'm not quite sure what the origin is. It came in on the drop drop dot IO slash daily source code title generation kill.

482
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And it sounds like two marines either in Afghanistan or in Iraq. I'm pretty sure it's Iraq.

483
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And it was an OG G file. So I had a trans code, which also kind of made me think that maybe it was a portable recording device or certainly something.

484
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Even if you listen to it, it sounds like they're handing a portable recording device back and forth amongst themselves. So it sounds extremely legit.

485
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:07,000
But it, it really does say something about what's happening over in the desert, where our brothers and sisters are children, our boys and girls, 19 years old, killing other children.

486
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Other brothers and sisters. And for what fucking energy, I can oil drugs and gold. That's all it seems to be about.

487
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And, you know, it troubles me so much.

488
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And we don't even, you know, we're such hypocritic fuck wards controlled by our mainstream media that we don't even want to acknowledge it.

489
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And when you listen to these guys talk about their lives and comparing it to the lives of, in this case, American citizens.

490
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And what's important to them and what their days are like and what our days are like.

491
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:58,000
It's just, it's just unconscionable that the true facts that what war really looks like and what's really happening except a daily body count.

492
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Well, that's all you get. Body count. Just a couple numbers.

493
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,000
No one even checks if they're for real anymore. There's no pictures. There's no pictures of the coffins draped in flags.

494
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Man, we would be so much more pissed off. We really saw what was going on, which is the only thing that was right about Vietnam as the press, at least had free reign in reporting on it and showing what was really happening.

495
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And it was scary and it affected people. And now we're all just drugged out one way or the other.

496
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
We're completely asleep, apathetic, and don't give a shit.

497
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Listen to these two marines. I think about what it means to you and what you should be meaning to them.

498
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:56,000
You're gonna remember 1775. I was born and a bomb graded. My mother was in him 16 and my father was the devil.

499
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Each moment that I lived is an additional credit upon your life. I ate concertina, this napal, but I could shoot around through a freeze ass at 300 meters.

500
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I traveled the globe, first year on anti-americans everywhere I go, for the river of Mom, Chevrolet, baseball, and apapai.

501
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I'm a grown, I'm a dirty nasty, sticky, sweaty, filthy, beautiful little son of a bitch that's kept the roof roof in the board for 225 years.

502
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:45,000
On the United States Marine, look like soldiers, top leg sails, slap the shoot at a boat home.

503
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So the eagle from the earth was the roofed on an anchor from the Navy, and on the 7th day in God rested, whoever ran his perimeter will run the show ever since.

504
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Whoever by night, joker betrus, who my God, stood for the best.

505
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:16,000
The Social Sacrifice of day-to-day military personnel, especially combat veterans, is under-appreciated.

506
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And you got the American Society, when it run, the fastest they can to the counter stop, to the fucking new stance, and grab motherfucking us weaklys, and fucking people magazine, just to see what fucking Jake Jillonfall did on Thursday afternoon.

507
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:40,000
You know what I did Thursday afternoon? I put one of my motherfucking Marines on a plane. I put that motherfucking bird to fucking know where.

508
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I picked his lifeless ass up body, put him on a stretcher, and put him off.

509
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I'll put that while that being a motherfucking magazine.

510
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Or how about, let's put a day in a life of fucking any average Marine out here, going through the streets of our body.

511
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Their biggest concern is that, you know, they couldn't buy a local latte at fucking Starbucks because it was under construction.

512
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Our biggest motherfucking concern is getting blown up on fucking 29 or 5 in Michigan.

513
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:19,000
The women go home and they're going to say, wave your little flag and say, welcome home, thanks for serving all like to go on, not get in the fall.

514
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
There it is, folks, we're sitting here fighting for your freedoms. You got the right to say what you want.

515
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
We got the right to much of your fucking mouth, we disagree.

516
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:39,000
We got the right to much of your fucking mouth, we got the right to much of your fucking mouth, we got the right to much of your fucking mouth, we got the right to much of your fucking mouth, we got the right to much of your fucking mouth.

517
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Some of those that work for us is, draw the thing that works for us is, oh, you're the name of, you're the name of, you're the name of, now you do what they told you, now you do what they told you, now you do what they told you, now you do what they told you, now you do what they told you.

522
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

523
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:59,000
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, ready, jump, go,

524
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

525
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

526
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

527
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

528
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

529
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

530
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

531
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

532
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

533
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

534
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

535
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

536
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

537
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

538
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

539
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

540
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

541
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

542
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I can't believe you can't tell me

543
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:10,760
I pray for those boys, I all children, the Iranian children, the Georgian children, the

544
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,240
South, the city of children, my own child, all of them.

545
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,240
Christ, man, this is just so wrong.

546
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,560
It's starting to really bother me.

547
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:31,080
So anyways, I was saying earlier about Murdoch, great documentary called Outfox.

548
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,520
It's a Rupert Murdoch's war on journalism.

549
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,520
You gotta see that.

550
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,680
A whole bunch of ex-fox news reporters.

551
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,680
It starts with WTTG, I think it's in Washington, D.C., and they tell you, they'll show

552
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:48,120
you exactly how it all happens and how the manipulation of, you know, the media takes place.

553
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:52,640
They will explain to you exactly how it goes and it's not like journalists are dumb, journalists

554
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:57,840
are great, most of them are, but it's the decisions that the editors make and that comes

555
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:02,400
from up high and you gotta see this documentary and that's all, that's gotta be homework.

556
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,120
You gotta take a look at that.

557
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,040
Got Ray on the Charlie coming up for you, which means we'll have something hokey going

558
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,040
back to 19.

559
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:14,120
I don't even listen to them anymore because they just want to be surprised by whatever

560
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:18,120
Ray puts together some kind of song from the soundtrack in my life and usually some

561
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,280
embarrassing moments from my past career.

562
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,840
So we'll get to that in a second, here's another one.

563
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:31,040
Here's how we, here's how much we love our kids, San Antonio, Texas, court authorities

564
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,520
will be able to track students with a history of skipping school under a new program requiring

565
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:41,120
them to wear ankle bracelets with global positioning systems monitoring.

566
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:46,800
Oh man, this is what we used to call play in hokey, right?

567
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,560
And you played hokey, you got the tension.

568
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,920
And what is this now?

569
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,720
Because we have the technology, we're going to slap an ankle bracelet on our kids with GPS

570
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,320
so we can track them anywhere.

571
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,880
Oh, of course, at least one privacy group is worried.

572
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,640
The ankle bracelets will infringe on the students' privacy.

573
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:06,200
Yeah, no shit, this is lunacy.

574
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:11,720
And maybe we should stop trying to put GPS based band-aids on the problems and find out

575
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:15,600
maybe these kids are just too fucking intelligent for the idiotic schooling that we're

576
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,600
giving them.

577
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,040
My daughter's on to it.

578
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,960
She's totally, and she's like, man, they teach me crap at school.

579
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,640
And you want to hear what the, what she liked the most was English literature because

580
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,440
she could just go back to old stuff and read it and interpret it.

581
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:38,040
And you know, that's just, but it's literature, it's not history, it's ridiculous.

582
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:42,320
So now, you know, now, of course, she's off to college starting in September.

583
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:47,520
She's going to study drama and photography, which is specialized courses, but as a base,

584
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,520
a base level.

585
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,400
Dude, she learned a shitload more from just traveling around the world with us than

586
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,840
anything she learned in school.

587
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,200
So maybe these kids are just, you know, the next generation, maybe they're just extremely

588
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,200
brilliant.

589
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:04,560
Ever think of that, that this whole ADHD that all of a sudden became an illness and

590
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:11,000
gives us reason to pop riddle in on our kids and, you know, in some extreme cases, give

591
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:17,080
an electro shock therapy that, you know, maybe that's just because they're fucking brilliant.

592
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,080
Is that possible?

593
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,440
It seems certainly seems possible in my mind that there's a next step of evolution

594
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,440
in these kids.

595
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,520
Certainly, certainly feels that way to me.

596
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:31,160
Yeah, so instead of actually trying to fix the problem, there you go.

597
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,760
That's what you got to do.

598
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,120
Slap a GPS based ankle bracelet on.

599
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:54,360
Boy, the soundtrack to my life, let's take a look at the landscape on a road trip through

600
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,360
your life.

601
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:03,200
These episodes and queries, the soundtrack to my life, brings us back to my team for

602
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,200
our good.

603
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:08,760
The most 20 years old remember his parents in an illness and tried to make living

604
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,960
fubbying a winter in restaurants.

605
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:17,640
He also did some Dutch viral radio work on that radio, as certain moments and certainly

606
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:23,040
the escalation letter together, the videotape of himself to be boss of the world we

607
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:27,360
are talking about in the broadcast station of the Netherlands, from the car.

608
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:32,320
And can this be breaking broadcasting as the host of the team, the music television program

609
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,320
countdown.

610
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:38,560
So, if you want to be the media star, you also have to do some radio.

611
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:42,480
So, the first time with everything can be very scary.

612
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:48,120
A home for show or national radio with an out-free or malicious, and you still know what

613
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,800
your first record was on the national radio.

614
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,800
Yes, I do.

615
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,800
I remember very well.

616
00:57:53,800 --> 00:58:01,800
I remember a flashback to May 25, 1984, around a 30 p.m.

617
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:07,800
This was an unspeaked break on national radio, star of his confession.

618
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,800
I don't remember.

619
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,800
Here we go.

620
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,800
We move through.

621
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:13,800
We move through.

622
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,800
We move through.

623
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,800
We move through.

624
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:16,800
We move through.

625
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,800
We move through.

626
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,800
This is a hobby.

627
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:24,800
When you hear some, well, wake me up before your go-go, maybe something drew that into the two forming.

628
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,800
I won't.

629
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,800
All of that's right.

630
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,800
They want me to do the show in English.

631
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,800
I remember that.

632
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,800
The explain what I'm doing here actually I'm filling in for start to bat.

633
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,800
Laying work, part of the truth is bitter, I think, being a boy is not the wilder.

634
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,800
It's a fact.

635
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,800
It's a fact.

636
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,800
It's a fact.

637
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,800
It's a fact.

638
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,800
It's a fact.

639
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,800
It's a fact.

640
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,800
It's a fact.

641
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,800
This is embarrassing.

642
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,800
I think there's a lot of fun, hot-plane records here on radio Veronica.

643
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,800
It's really scary.

644
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,800
Go above in the beginning.

645
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,800
Give me five, 60, let's go.

646
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,800
Wh elsaheem!

647
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,800
Are they ready to play?

648
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,800
It's really scary.

649
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,800
Get up!

650
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,800
Oh yeah!

651
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,800
That's a dyro!

652
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:12,800
I hope the website will even find everything about two short-term on-lines.

653
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,800
Hey, what's this?

654
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,800
Hello?

655
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,800
Alright, now for a while.

656
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,800
Hey, Tom, good to hear from you.

657
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,800
I'm late, I did.

658
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,800
My head is in the green of the night,

659
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,800
and I see the love of you,

660
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,800
been visiting and re-cast again.

661
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,800
The A-own guilty,

662
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,800
had a check-as for some old A-use material,

663
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,800
that of me.

664
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,800
What the heck?

665
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,800
Why I got you in the line?

666
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,800
Can you upload the full episodes without the editing?

667
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,800
I need you to know the truth that I've come on.

668
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,800
I don't want to get in trouble with the man.

669
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,800
About the music rides man.

670
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,800
Come on, man.

671
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,800
It's on music.

672
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,800
40s for old tapes.

673
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,800
No one's going to complain.

674
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,800
Alright, man.

675
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,800
I've been left.

676
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,800
What do you do with you like the first?

677
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,800
Well, we are looking at 984 as a moment.

678
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,800
I need you to work.

679
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,800
He's got all my old tapes.

680
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,800
I've got all my old tapes.

681
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,800
I've got all my old tapes.

682
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:58,800
40 flash.

683
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,800
I've got all my old tapes.

684
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,800
40 flash.

685
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,800
Thanks Tom.

686
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,800
No problem.

687
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,800
Thank you for being late.

688
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:05,800
Thanks Tom.

689
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,800
