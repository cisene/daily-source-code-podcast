1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,720
We're 60 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass, done the next generation

2
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,720
of radio content in my ears.

3
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,720
I like to think I'm flying to the future.

4
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,720
I'm casting this fellow curry.

5
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,720
Hey brother, welcome to Cell7Tain.

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,720
All the eight years old.

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,720
I was having a plane at the pub.

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,720
They got me from being a baker and an alcoholic.

9
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,720
How about you?

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,720
I had a cold.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,720
Took more than the recommended dose of the medicine.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,720
So they got me for being a drug addict and spreading the virus.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,720
A good thing you didn't run, it'd be good.

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,720
What about the guy sleeping in the corner for the toll blonde one?

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,720
Oh, that's Adam.

16
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,720
They got him for producing the DSC 765.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,720
Talking about liberty, freedom, and all the things they despise.

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,720
Good morning, Pinging up.

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
It's seeming many can't.

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720
We come in numbers and I'm all wrong.

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,720
We didn't come to dance.

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
We came to make it known.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,720
We're like the motherfucking covers on a naked go.

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,720
Don't want to break in us.

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,720
And that's the bottom line.

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Take it by the everything to take.

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
We're in these fun and time.

28
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
It's time to throw the shoulders.

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,720
It's time to go to work.

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,720
Getting tangled in the muscles for another more.

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,720
I can't look at your mane.

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
I guess I've had it good.

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,720
I guess that I think he won't act in like his Hollywood.

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,720
But what about the people?

35
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
Don't want to see you.

36
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,720
There's the end of the people dying and they think it's evil.

37
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
This ain't a fairytale.

38
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
This ain't a common book.

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
This is baby skiing.

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
It make a wilder mama look.

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,720
It's the philosophy.

42
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
Based on hypocrisy.

43
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,720
The province and province.

44
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,720
If you're in the economy.

45
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
So where's the honesty?

46
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
Beneath the blanket statements.

47
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,720
The government's creating nature.

48
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
Make you think there's seven nations.

49
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
We're here to hold your head.

50
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
In this broken land.

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,720
We brought a list of everything that just took off the hand.

52
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
We throw it in anger.

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
It's safe.

54
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
Exactly.

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
I just throw that.

56
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,720
But everybody should be happy when they hold the flag.

57
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
You let away the pride.

58
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
You better say it loud.

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,720
It's time for you to play.

60
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
Delete and so we'll take you out.

61
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
We're going to kick it up.

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,720
It's easy.

63
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
We ran again.

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
We're coming numbers.

65
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
And I'm almost having jettison.

66
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
We didn't come to death.

67
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,720
We came to make you known.

68
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,720
We're like the months.

69
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
When covers on, I make you come home.

70
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
So we'll do things enough.

71
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
And that's the bottom line.

72
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
They can buy it.

73
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
That we can take with it.

74
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
It needs more to time.

75
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,720
If I'm sure the show was just trying to go to war.

76
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
Getting taken.

77
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,720
They look what's just for another four.

78
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
I guess I should be thankful.

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
I guess I really am.

80
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
I guess that I should stay.

81
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,720
I'm proud to be American.

82
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,720
But what about the one that's crowded on the other end?

83
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,720
Well, hope is getting crunched under the power of the upper hand.

84
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
This thing to revolution.

85
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
This thing to remedy.

86
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,720
If it's a show that you can control it.

87
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
What's the enemy?

88
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
It's the reality.

89
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,720
Based on the priorities.

90
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,720
Started with the steps.

91
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
And it driven by your salary.

92
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
I wonder how you eat.

93
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
We brought the distance.

94
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
Just taking population.

95
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
Think it's rolling.

96
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
I'm like living pump.

97
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Speak a little.

98
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
You think it's a bit up.

99
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
If you want to say a lot.

100
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,720
It's a problem to the sunset.

101
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Don't you believe in God.

102
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
You can't believe in me.

103
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Don't you know that we will rest until we see you free.

104
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
It's time to celebrate.

105
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
We found a better way.

106
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
You better love it.

107
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Or you won't get in the heavens game.

108
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
You won't get in the heavens game.

109
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
You won't get in the heavens game.

110
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
You won't get in the heavens game.

111
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
We come in numbers.

112
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
And I'm almost happy to understand.

113
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720

We come in numbers and I'm almost happy to understand.

178
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,720
We come in numbers and I'm almost happy to understand.

179
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,720
We come in numbers and I'm almost happy to understand.

180
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,720
We come in numbers and I'm almost happy to understand.

181
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,720
We come in numbers and I'm almost happy to understand.

182
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,720
We come in numbers and I'm almost happy to understand.

183
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,720
We come in numbers and I'm almost happy to understand.

184
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,720
We come in numbers and I'm almost happy to understand.

185
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
We come in numbers and I'm almost happy to understand.

186
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
We come in numbers and I'm almost happy to understand.

187
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
We come in numbers and I'm almost happy to understand.

188
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,720
We come in numbers and I'm almost happy to understand.

189
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
We come in numbers and I'm almost happy to understand.

190
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,720
Finally I'm on the source called Drop somewhere,

191
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,760
I examined my little lot outline.

192
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,240
Ready to play for you and with that intro from Petey Love.

193
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,360
How could I resist?

194
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,600
Coming to you from the west side of GTown hay here in gil.

195
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,640
For to get a little different set up,

196
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,560
oh, by the way, that of course is the affluent

197
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,160
suburb of Surrey, known as Gilford.

198
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,240
I've changed the position of my mic.

199
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,800
I've been doing so much work behind the microphone

200
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,280
for the best, oh, what is it?

201
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,400
I've passed a couple of weeks, really,

202
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,800
because I've been doing this Dutch thing in the morning

203
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,480
for Arrow Classic Rock, which is so perfect

204
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,840
to have me in the morning.

205
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,840
And, you know, so my ass hurts, my back is starting to,

206
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,000
what I really need is I need the big ass,

207
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
you know, the podcast console that my father

208
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,560
and I built for me, which was too big to even get into the house,

209
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,960
or even to get out of the old house,

210
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,480
since he actually built it in the studio over there.

211
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,320
That's what I need, man.

212
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,240
I need to be able to stand up

213
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,840
when I have to look into one of those tables

214
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,360
that you can change the hide automatically.

215
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
So now the microphone is, instead of off to the left,

216
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,160
it's right in front of me,

217
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,040
we'll see if it makes any difference.

218
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,160
But I gotta tell you,

219
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,760
I've really been doing something kind of on the slide,

220
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,040
which I, you know, I didn't want to really talk too much

221
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,800
about it until I started

222
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,640
succeeding.

223
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,080
And that really happened over the past two days.

224
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,680
See, the main reason I was interested in participating

225
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,200
in, you know, looking at transferring

226
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,960
some of what I've learned on the daily source code

227
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,520
onto live radio in such a very small market as, as Holland.

228
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,520
Is, I want, I'm really trying to infiltrate.

229
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,960
Now, what do I mean by that?

230
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,200
You know, I sit here, day in, day out.

231
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,440
Sometimes actually record it and we share it together.

232
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,560
But I basically all day long, I'm thinking about

233
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,600
what the hell is going on in the world?

234
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,760
And how can I affect it?

235
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,920
How can I affect things?

236
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,320
How can I make things change?

237
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,440
How can I figure out how things are really working?

238
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,640
And of course, you know, together,

239
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,440
we've already figured out quite a lot of stuff

240
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,320
with just the chuckleheads in general.

241
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,360
And of course, this advanced checking in.

242
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,800
But I need to infiltrate into the political circuit.

243
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,080
Not being in the United States, I say,

244
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,520
that's pretty much hopeless.

245
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,400
I've been trying with Dr. Ron Paul

246
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,240
and, you know, to some degree,

247
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,680
I've learned, well, certainly learned a lot.

248
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,360
Really haven't, you know, we haven't gotten quite

249
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,960
where we need to be.

250
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,760
It's also very, very complicated, you know,

251
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,320
being over here most of the time,

252
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,320
or even half of the time, as it sometimes turns out, it's tough.

253
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,440
Don't know, shit all about the United Kingdom.

254
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,000
You know, only only know some of the cultural things

255
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,920
I've picked up since we've been living here.

256
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,040
The Netherlands, though, I do know a little bit more

257
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,720
about, and most of the politicians there

258
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,960
are, believe it or not, they're pretty much my age now.

259
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,040
There's a whole, you know, new generation

260
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,200
of young politicians.

261
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,800
And many of them quite a bit younger.

262
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,240
And boy, do they love media?

263
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,520
They don't understand, you know, independent media,

264
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,760
podcasting, anything like that.

265
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,280
They really, they really don't.

266
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,480
And quite honestly, I understand, because a lot of their

267
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,640
conversation is played through the news media, or the live

268
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,520
media, and radio being a perfect example of that.

269
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,320
So really, you know, I've been out on a quest

270
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,560
I've been trying to figure out, how can I learn something?

271
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,320
How can I get further towards this new European Parliament?

272
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,400
You know, I understand what's going on here.

273
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,560
I mean, this is going to be the United States of Europe,

274
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,160
whether they say it is a risen.

275
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,240
And there's all kinds of, man, this is just so much stuff going on.

276
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,960
And, you know, if you look online and look at any of the,

277
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,360
and by the way, the DailySource Code drop drop.io slash

278
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,760
DailySource Code is a great resource for all kinds of conspiracy

279
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,400
theory stuff.

280
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,080
But when you look at it, and you know, on at face value,

281
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,040
how the Rockefeller's initially invested in the United

282
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,920
Nations, or gifted the money to the United Nations,

283
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,160
which in a way down the line has become a lot of the vision of

284
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,720
what the European Union is, and how all of these 27 states

285
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,200
are coming to it.

286
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Look, they call them states.

287
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,520
I mean, Christ, did not make sense.

288
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,840
Did the United States of Europe isn't pretty obvious what's going on?

289
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,400
And it's going to be a huge, a huge superpower already.

290
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,680
The euro is outrageously powerful, certainly compared to other currencies.

291
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,280
And this is going to be a four, 500 million people all on all told.

292
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,240
And, you know, we're seeing a democracy, a, maybe even a Republican

293
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,640
away, but certainly a union forming that is just, you know,

294
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,600
it's a once in a lifetime opportunity.

295
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,520
And it's going to be a force to be reckoned with already.

296
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,600
Even today, it touches the US in many different ways.

297
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,880
It affects our lives, even how companies like Microsoft behave is

298
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,400
now dictated by the European Union.

299
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,200
So when it came down to this constitution, which I talked about in the previous episode,

300
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,640
the one where only Ireland can apparently save Europe from going into devastation.

301
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,400
I've had the opportunity over the past two days to talk to ministers or parliament.

302
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,120
Actually, one of the ministers who is in the, what is it?

303
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,440
The minister, the council of ministers, I think, in the, in Brussels.

304
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,560
And I'm going to share some of that with you,

305
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,800
because I learned some things.

306
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,600
I asked, and see, unfortunately, here's the whole bummer to this thing.

307
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,120
All of that shit is done in Dutch.

308
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,160
There is a podcast version, which the guys at the station do by agreement with great

309
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,680
diligence.

310
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,840
They cut out all the music, of course, because a lot of license, most of the music

311
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
that's played is licensed.

312
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:02,520
And it's still a good, you know, 60% of the show, 70% maybe, even is music.

313
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,840
And all the other, you know, the interviews are in Dutch, which, of course,

314
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,840
is what makes sense is why these guys even come on the show to speak in the,

315
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,080
in the mother tongue of the land.

316
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,000
So I kind of bites that I can't really share the actual audio with you.

317
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,480
But as I get to know them, and I'm now on first name basis, because that's the first

318
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,600
thing I do, they say, look, you know, can we just, you know,

319
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,360
on a first name basis here for a second?

320
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,520
Because you know, the, in Dutch is a very formal way of addressing someone, like,

321
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,560
unlike French, we have two would be the informal way, and vo would be the very formal

322
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
way.

323
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,400
So we have that in Dutch as well, but it's tough because here I am translating questions

324
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,840
I have in English into Dutch.

325
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,040
And then I have to, you know, also be correct and address them in the formal way,

326
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,800
you know, or her, you know, so the first thing I say is, you know, hey,

327
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,120
can we just address each other like friends?

328
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,840
There's a word for it called two, two a year, which is, of course, a French word.

329
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,320
So can we use the, the two, the informal version of each other?

330
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,960
And they all, you know, and they all say yes, which really really changes the whole

331
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
conversation.

332
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,600
So I want to talk a bit about that today.

333
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,520
And of course, there's lots of stuff you guys have been sending in.

334
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,440
Let me just make sure I've got everything set here and got to set that one.

335
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,080
Okay, ready for blast off.

336
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
Here we go.

337
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Curry, personal awesome thing.

338
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,400
Quick effect, God boss, life, liberty, and of course happiness, one of the most famous

339
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,920
phrases of United States, that worries of independence.

340
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,560
Yeah, you know, when I said it yesterday, I realized I messed it up.

341
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
Go ahead.

342
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:33,400
It has absolutely no legal grounds for the constitution of America, is simply telling

343
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,480
the British at the time to piss off.

344
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,560
Now certainly, the pursuit of happiness has appears in the 1960s, so it's your main court

345
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
case, loving versus Virginia.

346
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,560
But technically speaking, a lot of people misquote that and say it has nothing to do with

347
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,680
our constitution or our laws.

348
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:56,240
And while certainly the constitution is based on my idea, that it's not in the constitution

349
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,960
or rather in the integration of independence, but, again, has no legal binding within the

350
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
U.S.

351
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,040
I'm glad to make sure you've gotten to that straight boss.

352
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
Great here.

353
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Hope you'll win.

354
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
That's it.

355
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
Folder.

356
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
Oh, that's good.

357
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:16,280
Two times this week, and to all of the bastards there in Washington, D.C., you work

358
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
for me.

359
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Peace.

360
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Right on, man.

361
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Absolutely.

362
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Another thing I've been telling these politicians, I'll start it off, I'll butter

363
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,800
him up, I say, hey, man, thank you very much for coming on the show, and thank you

364
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,280
for your many years of service to us.

365
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,680
They all go like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, finally props, but you know, in the same

366
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,440
time, I'm saying, thanks for your service to us, which is my little private joke, oh, I wish

367
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,440
you guys could be in on this.

368
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,480
Anyway, so as I get to know these guys, of course, they're all completely well versed

369
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,840
in English, and I'll be able to set up interviews, particularly the guys who are in

370
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,040
the European Parliament, but they got friends too, you know, they all visited each other

371
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
right now.

372
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,520
One of these guys is meeting with Bush today, in fact, the prime minister of the Netherlands

373
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:05,760
is meeting with Bush as well as the minister of Foreign Affairs, I believe.

374
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,240
So I've just taken an interest to this, and he's got the European Union, they're so stupid.

375
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,360
They put everything they do on the internet, everything, and it's unedited, complete,

376
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,000
raw form, which, of course, is horrible for communicating stuff, because you just can't

377
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,680
understand what the hell it's about, it's like this whole constitution and the, the

378
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,440
trade, the Lisbon Treaty, you know, it's, it's legal speak, which I talked to these guys,

379
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,240
this fucking law, and only a lawyer can understand this, and maybe he won't even know exactly

380
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
what it means.

381
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,160
Yes, you're right, you know, we need to simplify, yeah, so the lot of talking around

382
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,480
simplification, which they're not doing, which, of course, makes everyone, including

383
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,200
the highly suspicious.

384
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,720
Anyway, I do want to clarify some things about the constitution.

385
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Here's what I've learned.

386
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,080
So I confronted a couple of these members of Parliament here, or not here in the Netherlands.

387
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,560
I said, you know, according to the bylaws and the protocols, which, you know, you

388
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:06,160
have to refer to from the Lisbon Treaty, this is so crazy how these guys have it set up.

389
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:13,440
It says, you know, for instance, you have a right to freedom, unless you are spreading contagious

390
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,840
diseases, or unless you are a vagrant, or unless you're a drug addict, or an alcoholic,

391
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,400
or of unsound mind.

392
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,320
Like, dude, that can't be in the constitution in a country where I live, because I'm,

393
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,400
I'm, you know, I'm out on three counts.

394
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:34,040
Well, no, Mr. Curry, let, actually, they said, Adam, let me just restate how it works.

395
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:43,480
That is a global, go, go, guideline, but each country individually can supersede on a national

396
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,120
level.

397
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,040
So that was interesting to me.

398
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
It says two things.

399
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,040
One, at least one or two of these 27 countries that make up the member states, it got

400
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,000
some pretty messed up human rights issues, and I want to avoid it.

401
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So I'd like to have a laminated card, please.

402
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,040
The television, which one will arrest me if I'm a vagrant, or an alcoholic, or a drug

403
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,960
user, or if I can spread contagious diseases?

404
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,600
So that's one.

405
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,920
So when I say, what's the benefit?

406
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,560
So by the way, I think, you know, that's a, that's pretty important because that was

407
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,760
really what my whole rant was about on Tuesday.

408
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:22,280
By the way, when questioned, no one could actually point in the treaty, though Lisbon

409
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,480
treaty, or the original constitution document to where it actually says that, apparently

410
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,320
it spread out over several different pieces of language.

411
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,680
So I'm still highly suspicious.

412
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,600
There are some interesting things, though, on an EU level, on a European level, there

413
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,600
will be policy for immigration as an example.

414
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,320
Now they haven't said it yet, but at least they've got some kind of legal guidelines.

415
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,800
And I guess that's kind of good, because at the end of the day, you've got to have a lot

416
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,240
of lawyers talking to each other.

417
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,520
But what bums me out is that no matter what country you're in, if I contest the law in the

418
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,360
United Kingdom, I have to go to Brussels, you know, I could, I could actually have to go

419
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,920
to Brussels for other reasons.

420
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,360
They could call me there immediately.

421
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,920
So you won't really be, you know, it's kind of like the states, I guess.

422
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,560
I think it really is turning out to be a lot like the United States of Europe because

423
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,520
you've got your state laws, they've got your federal laws.

424
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,080
But they're starting out with a bloated government, you know, we built one over over a couple

425
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
hundred years.

426
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,440
They've got it all set up, man.

427
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,440
And they've got this all bloated.

428
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,920
They can't even be in one town.

429
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,080
They've got to be in two towns.

430
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,760
They've got to be in Brussels.

431
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,320
And as an incredibly, as an incredibly said Luxembourg on a previous show, I meant

432
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,440
Strasbourg, they're in two towns.

433
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,560
And I totally believe that they, what's going on in Central Europe in Brussels is definitely

434
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:44,120
some kind of political elite who want to control the world, or at least a little piece

435
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
of it.

436
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,600
No doubt about it.

437
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,120
And it's proof of that all over the place, like our good buddy, fellow chucklehead from

438
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,680
the Netherlands, the limonada man, or the limonada man, known as the lemonade.

439
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:00,320
I was thinking, last 23rd of May, the Dutch minister of youth was seriously proposing

440
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:06,120
a law that would forbid teachers to be in the street after 9 or 10 p.m., as known as

441
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
a curfew.

442
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,720
Without parental guiding, I can't imagine how bloody the streets will be on a Saturday

443
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,920
or Saturday morning, if this legal killing at for example, is just a surface, would

444
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,600
become any in effect.

445
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,920
Yeah, you know, so that's what there you go.

446
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
It's confusion.

447
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,140
Here's a citizen saying, like, well, first of all, how can they make a law that

448
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,140
keep that a curfew?

449
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,440
I guess you can do it locally, but then what if you break that, they could kill your

450
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
kids?

451
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,800
Actually, I think that was part of the other piece of the freedom doctrine there, was that

452
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,160
they could arrest your kids if they need to be educated properly.

453
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:45,440
So yeah, I think we need to figure out what the local laws are in each individual country,

454
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,960
but some of them have gotta be messed up, just read the documents.

455
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,920
Anyway, you might like to talk to Richard Feldhaus, all the largest commercial radio station

456
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,920
in the Netherlands.

457
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,600
He spent many times to discuss the proposed constitution of the EU.

458
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:05,080
Yeah, just a reminder, you know, the Netherlands voted no as, as did France, France.

459
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,080
And I'm convinced now that no one actually voted because they read the document and said,

460
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,560
hey, this constitution sucks.

461
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,680
They voted no because they said, you guys are being sneaky.

462
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
Screw you.

463
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,000
We're not going to let you have anything.

464
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,280
He barely could get any yes, Father.

465
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,080
In my own inner circle, I couldn't find any either.

466
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
Now check this out.

467
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,720
10 foil hats on, everybody, you're going to need it for this.

468
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,520
The end result of the referendum was 49, yes, against 51, no, to me.

469
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,800
That was the indication, the voting machines were having malicious firmware.

470
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
I love that.

471
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,880
Wait a minute, let me adjust the tin foil hat, or what is it, what's it known as?

472
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,440
The aluminum foil deflector beanie, that's what it is.

473
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,400
Aluminum foil deflector beanie, hold on a second.

474
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Yes, the voting machines are rigged, I hear you.

475
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,680
By the way, the same Dutch voting machines that were used in this referendum were also

476
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,760
tested by the Irish national lab.

477
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,320
Were they used in Florida by any chance?

478
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,800
A lab just like Sania in the US is halfway, those tests, the Dutch voting machines were ignored

479
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:14,400
because they were too ridiculous to spend any attention to anymore.

480
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,480
You might like to refer to Wifterhaus Tempcomputer's.nl.

481
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,880
I got to write that one down, which is also available in English.

482
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,080
This organization finally was able to make the government discontinuing the use of those

483
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,080
machines.

484
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,720
There are danger for the democracy.

485
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,600
The manufacturers were trying to drop those machines in New York after the Dutch government

486
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
discontinued the use.

487
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,800
Wait a minute, the Dutch government discontinued the continued use of the voting machines

488
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:50,640
because they were rigged basically and then they tried to drop them in New York.

489
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,720
It looked like the first of their prevented that New York would start to use them.

490
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,440
That's outrageous, man.

491
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Give me the URL.

492
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:06,280
Let me mention the URL again, but to prevent perfect programmer like URLs, I made that

493
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:14,800
mentioned URL, tiny URL and that's tiny URL.com slash and now it'll spell Yankee, Echo, Delta,

494
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Delta, 5-2.

495
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,640
You might like to put it in the show notes.

496
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,840
Dude, dude, dude, I will thank you so much.

497
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,320
Excellent intel there, lemonade man.

498
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,260
See, we're expanding our horizons, my friends, so a country that's never really been

499
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,760
into podcasting because they love their stupid radio, which, and believe me, it's pretty

500
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,560
stupid over there.

501
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,840
Let me see, I got all kinds of new clear stuff I want to talk about.

502
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,000
Actually, let's, I think I've finished up that topic for now, right?

503
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,560
So I'm keeping, there's another thing I'm tracking right now, you're going to love this.

504
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,240
It's been around for a while, but it only kind of doubled up to the top of someone sent

505
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,280
me a note about it, about the use of RFID chips in the euro.

506
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:04,360
There's also a rumor now that it's in the new U.S. $20 bills, I think.

507
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,160
You know what an RFID chip is?

508
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:12,160
It's a minuscule chip that can transmit a very short range radio frequencies, and it basically

509
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,120
is just identity itself, it's sending out an ID number.

510
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,920
Our pets actually have it.

511
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:22,120
The dog and the two cats, you know, when they enter into the country, then they have to

512
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,520
have all kinds of paperwork, and then they have an identification, and the vet has a little

513
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,080
syringe, and just shoots a chip in there, and he has a little sensor holds it over the

514
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,240
pets head, and blip, there's his number, so completely trackable.

515
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,680
These things are used in industrial purposes to track, basically you can insert it in

516
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,520
anything and contract parts or items, and of course, you could leave it in the close as

517
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:54,120
there was people by them and walk out of the shop, I would call that a security risk right

518
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,920
now, because of course, you can connect that particular garment to a credit card, therefore

519
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:04,240
an address and identity, but the rumor is now going around that they're actually embedded

520
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,080
into the money over here, not in the UK, but into the euro, in the five, the ten, and

521
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,640
the twenty euro bill, and you can test this, and this is the thing that gets me, and

522
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,560
by the way, I think you can also test this with the new US $20 bill, you put it in the

523
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,960
microwave for a couple of seconds, and literally within a second, you'll hear a pop, like

524
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:30,360
a little mini explosion, and you'll see a hole, and it might even start to burn a little

525
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,520
bit, it might start to flame, your results may vary due to your microwave's condition,

526
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,560
and it will be an exactly the same spot on all of the bills, which of course leads

527
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,200
the conspiracy theorists to believe, and I'm wearing the hat, my friends, I'm wearing

528
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,360
the beanie, that there's an RFID chip embedded into these bills, and of course there's

529
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,720
a lot of implications there, I mean, just imagine walking in somewhere and someone being

530
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,080
able to see how much cash you got on you, I mean, that's pretty scary, oh, he's got

531
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,640
four fibers, he's got a couple of 20s, he's got three tens, but you know, it makes

532
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,920
it trackable, and so that's when I'm on a quest now, I have calls into the Minister

533
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,760
of Finance, into the Minister of Economic Affairs, and I will take this all the way to the

534
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,200
European High Court to get an answer for someone to say yes or no, I'm also calling

535
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,800
to the guys who print the euro, so stay tuned for that.

536
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:30,920
Hello, Adam, it's Grey Lemme, I've put it down on that spot, this isn't a DSC 753,

537
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:39,120
it's bloody high prices, a diesel, but down here, I was playing, I just filled up this car,

538
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:48,120
and it was a £1.29, a liter of a diesel, who's that person saying, no use, you put diesel

539
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,000
it in a airplane, a diesel power airplane, since when does that, I thought the EF will

540
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,560
airplanes would need a petrol, out of gas, or jet, jet engines, so they wouldn't even be

541
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
possible.

542
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Just a power to wait.

543
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Oh, let me stop you there.

544
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:07,360
Dude, this is the big thing, particularly the diamond, I think, is there a Mitsubishi,

545
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,360
the diamond aircraft?

546
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,560
No, it's just diamond.

547
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,440
They've got 20sols, oh, it's really big, by the way, diesel is very close to jet

548
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,880
fuel fuel.

549
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,240
I have actually witnessed when training with what I think is not such a great training

550
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,600
for them, actually, because I was on a training flight, and we actually started to run

551
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:33,600
on a gas and had to find a place, an alternative to an airport to refuel in a fucking

552
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,000
Robinson 44.

553
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,280
We put it right down near gas station, and got, I don't know, I've got about 20 liters,

554
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,880
or 25 liters of diesel, and put that right in.

555
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,920
And it worked, it fired up, jet fired up, no problem, turbans spin, spun up, and we flew

556
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:52,120
off, and, you know, topped it up with jet fuel, then worked perfectly.

557
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,160
No, diesel's great, and there are engines that are specifically built to run on diesel

558
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
fuel.

559
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,600
Of course, they were kind of designed when diesel was a hell of a lot cheaper, and now it's

560
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,240
actually more, well, it's not as expensive as Avgas, which, of course, is 100 or above

561
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,160
stocktain, which I'm now paying two and a half euros per liter for, if you can believe

562
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
it is.

563
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Thank you.

564
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,200
You know, and you'd be much heavier, because of the unit, but there are not about aviation

565
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,400
airplanes, the aviation engines, and they have a quatter, they have a quatter, they have

566
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,160
a quatter, they have a quatter, they have a quatter, they have a quatter, they have

567
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,760
to be lightweight, a diesel, and you would be pretty heavy, that's what it's full, that's what

568
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,000
it's got, but self-sufficient, they'll need to know.

569
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Anyway, they went for us.

570
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Bye.

571
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,720
Hell yeah, they do.

572
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,880
A lot of people called in about this, man, a lot of people interested in the price

573
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,400
of diesel and how it works, all kinds of different opinions, and, of course, I've also

574
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:49,240
mentioned that, you know, if it's taxation, then it's not entirely fair for these prices,

575
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,040
because not everyone uses diesel to travel with.

576
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:59,920
Adam, zero here in North Carolina, you were just talking about not all people using diesel

577
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:06,760
or generating the wear and tear that tax pays for an economic phenomenon called in.

578
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,080
You referred to airplanes, you referred to other things.

579
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,240
There is a foreign diesel that you can get, it's not taxed the same, it's illegal to put

580
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,160
it in, a car that's driving on a road, it's meant for trackers and form equipment.

581
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:25,240
Yeah, they call that red diesel over here in Europe, yeah, I'm aware of it, and it's red,

582
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:31,680
because it's actually the color red, which is the quickest way for the authorities, the man,

583
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,280
to check and see what kind of diesel you're driving on.

584
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,680
And I have seen cars pulled over and checked for that, and I've seen people get busted for it,

585
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,080
but yeah, it's a hell of a lot cheaper, at least it was.

586
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,720
Not quite sure what the percentages these days, but yeah, I'm aware of that.

587
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,840
It's not putting wear and tear on the road.

588
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:53,440
There is a form diesel, like that, where you buy it, you're not putting it in your car,

589
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,120
you're not putting wear and tear on the road, and because of that, it's not taxed the same.

590
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,080
So if you knew that, I'd be live out in the stick.

591
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,040
And that was, I could see that a bit, all right.

592
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,960
All right, man, thank you.

593
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,760
They work for us.

594
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,400
Hell, yes, they, you know it, let's see.

595
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:15,040
Uh, Daniel Kleinberger, Adam, don't know if this is a fact, but an interesting note,

596
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:21,960
my grandpa is a guy nut, I'm not quite sure what you mean by that.

597
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,840
He's been, he's been one his whole life, and knows as far as I can tell everything about the vehicle.

598
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:35,240
Maybe even a car nut, diesel prices have risen because of a government conspiracy, kind of.

599
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,560
I just wanted to say that, but this is the reason he says why, okay, this is grandpa talking.

600
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:45,160
Global warming kind of, here's how he broke it down, they used to be cheap, very cheap.

601
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,560
This is because of all the great black smoke, you remember, seeing his kids behind the school bus.

602
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
Yeah, I remember that.

603
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,120
Well, the global warming conspiracy, charge more to people, as I call it, he says, wants

604
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
to make money.

605
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,760
Well, if we reduce how dirty diesel is, takes more money to refine it.

606
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,200
So the end result of diesel costing more, in our wisdom, well, we say we're destroying

607
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,880
the planet, we need to fix it and to make diesel cleaner, we need to pay more to refine it,

608
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,040
and now diesel costs more to make the gas, we're in the past that dirty diesel used to

609
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,000
be cheaper than the new and improved clean diesel.

610
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,680
That's what I've been hearing consistently, let's listen to a couple more voice comments.

611
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,960
Here we go.

612
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,760
Hey, I'm Jason from London, just calling to tell you why diesel's gotten so expensive.

613
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,400
Mostly, it's because of three factors.

614
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:32,120
First, diesel's in high demand worldwide, second because refining diesel is very close to

615
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,760
heating oil, with recent cold winters that demand for heating oil is up, which dries up

616
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,960
the price both heating oil and diesel, and last but not least, the US government regulations

617
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,560
are demanding lower sulfur content driving up the cost of refining.

618
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,440
Well, that's all some questions you've had of you.

619
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,280
No, I'll talk to you later.

620
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,280
And they work for us one more.

621
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,400
And I told him from that way, I've got a question.

622
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,480
That's Tom from Melbourne, he's weighed down under, so it's actually a weekend where he is.

623
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:10,600
I have about the oil prices, and I thought that the price of oil is shut up recently

624
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:20,840
is because we've hit the top of peak oil, and since 2005, there hasn't been any more production

625
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,880
than that, because we have a lot of big demand.

626
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,640
Same supply, it sort of means that prices go up.

627
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,920
The Dango curve of this natural distribution is obviously like quicker than the

628
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,800
outgoing curve, because the whole infrastructure to use the oil is already there.

629
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:47,960
So basically, it's just that the matter of supply and demand, I think people are getting

630
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:55,080
confused about that, isn't that the reason? It's running out, it's a natural resource, it's running

631
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:02,760
out petrol prices will not come down until a scalable alternative is found.

632
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:10,760
And I'm sorry, folks. I'm going to live a bit. All right, I wish I could say that work for us,

633
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,520
but I think they work for themselves.

634
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,160
Now, you got to be optimistic, my friend. They work for us.

635
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,920
I think you're all right, basically, it's a number of factors. It's a perfect storm.

636
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,160
The peak oil, of course, I've seen the documentaries online that has something to do with it,

637
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,960
no doubt about it. Although, if we truly hit the peak, then the price will just keep going

638
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:37,000
up, and it is fluctuating. It's going up and down. So, yeah, supply and demand definitely,

639
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and that is how the price of oil has been determined historically by

640
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,240
the organizations, the organization countries like OPEC saying, look, we're turning it down or

641
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,680
not, you're turning it up and not, you're more supply, less supply, totally just by, you know,

642
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:02,520
nudging it could change the price. It's traders. It's big institutions like insurance companies

643
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,560
who are buying up oil and rolling it over month to month and have oil literally sitting around

644
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:13,400
in tankers and circling the globe. Something else I read. Someone dropped something on the

645
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:19,640
source code drop drop.io slash data source code. It was something called splash and dash

646
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:27,080
where the tanker will get cheap oil in South America. I think that's what it was. Then

647
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:35,160
Bob on by, you know, stop, maybe it wasn't South America. Somehow, I should look at it again.

648
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:40,280
But somehow it was like, you know, drop it in a dash of a US oil on top of it to get like a dollar

649
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,440
tax credit and then floating it over to Europe. It was some scam that I got to look into. I'm sure

650
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,160
someone whoever dropped it in their sending a voicemail comment or calling the voicemail lines,

651
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:57,000
if you don't mind. So anyway, so it's big institutions. They're definitely part of this. It's

652
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,240
greed, no kidding. The credit crunch, you know, it's just a perfect, perfect storm at all fits

653
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,040
together. And there are some people getting really, really rich off of this. And it's not just

654
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,320
necessarily the oil companies because they do have to, you know, if they want to grow, they're

655
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,440
not stupid. They know that they, you know, they're not sitting around and saying, look, well,

656
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,600
I'll be dead in 30 years anyway. So let's just live it up. You know, these are big corporations.

657
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,120
They got to figure something out. I personally have really starting to lean towards a nuclear energy.

658
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:30,600
Oh, speaking of nuclear energy. I got to, let me just read this email from briefly,

659
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:37,640
from D.D. And she says, she's from Ontario, Canada. And she said, you were talking about

660
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,760
nuclear and I had this feeling I'd heard about it somewhere before. And indeed, it was an

661
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:49,960
ad that was running Ontario, Canada rebranding nuclear to nuclear. And so she sent it over to

662
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,680
we check this out. It's perfect. It's exactly what I want. This is how nuclear energy should be

663
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,320
marketed at all times in the future. This year, Ontario will decide on its future energy mix.

664
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,760
So just insert your country's name here. The reality is, the equivalent of 80% of our current

665
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:10,600
power capacity will soon need replacing conservation renewables and hydro can help. But nuclear

666
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:16,680
will continue to play a leading role. Nuclear is clean and reliable. It's been with us over 40 years.

667
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:22,840
Already supplies 51% of our electricity and must gear up now to help power the years ahead.

668
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:29,160
A message from the Canadian Nuclear Association more power to you. It's fresh. More power to you,

669
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:37,400
exactly. I love it. That's a nice happy kind of messaging we need. You think it sounds scary,

670
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,480
but I'm telling you, there's really something to this. I think that a lot of money is being spent

671
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:48,280
on keeps steering us away from nuclear energy and keeping us focused on windmills and shit.

672
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,400
That is just not quite there yet. This technology has been around a long time. It's really been

673
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:59,320
improved quite a lot and already, as you can hear right there, connect, connect nuclear.

674
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:07,720
Right there in Ontario, 50% generated by nuclear energy. It's still hard to say, even though

675
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,840
I rebranded it. Let me see, what should we do? Should we play one more song?

676
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,480
Actually, there is maybe one thing I just want to read and then I'll play a song for you. This was

677
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:27,080
email titled, The Drunken Londoner is he mad. I wish this was audio. It would be so much better.

678
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,120
Adam, I have to agree with you with the state of public transport. Now, this is regarding the new law

679
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:39,800
in the United Kingdom where drinking of alcoholic beverages or carrying an open container of alcohol

680
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:46,280
is no longer allowed as of June 1, 2008. Drinking and drunks on the last trainer bus makes it very

681
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:52,200
intimidating and I'm a big bloke. Also, fucking twots playing music on phone speakers. It's

682
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,760
bad enough one person, but sometimes you can have four or five of them all. Most of the time,

683
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,920
some other tuneless gangster rap and if you ask them to, maybe they use headphones,

684
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:07,640
you get abuse. It's at this time that I use my powers given to me by the queen to ask them to leave

685
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:14,040
the bus. If not, I use force to do so. Usually, to a round of applause. The Drunken

686
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:20,120
Londoner, that of course is our very own chuckle head. Sorry, pal. Why do you need to drink on the

687
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:26,280
tube? Don't you get 24 hours drinking in pubs and clubs? Make get over it. There's some more serious

688
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:32,520
attacks on our liberty. Oh, Adam, on CCTV, I use that in my work. I disagree strongly with that

689
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,360
senior officer. CCTV is a valuable tool if used correctly, but what concerns me is the number of

690
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,560
large shopping centers that stick up CCTVs sometimes a long way from their own property. Why?

691
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,000
In large cities, there can be hundreds of different CCTV schemes, most of them overlapping,

692
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,360
to want to come see, discuss it. I'm willing to arrange a visit so you can see for yourself. Yes,

693
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:01,640
I work for you. Work long hours, long shift hours. And I'll just say this is from

694
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:09,400
Mueller. He signs off. And actually does provide some details, but he's a cop. So maybe

695
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,280
I'll go have a look and see how that's working. I'm open, you know. I'm the first guy that put the

696
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:23,560
tin foil hat on or the aluminum foil deflector beanie. But I'm very open. I'd love to see how it works.

697
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:31,480
And I'd love to have a look behind big brothers, you know, set up. I'm saying sound seeing tour with

698
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,440
the hidden camera, my friends. What do you think? All right. Let me, uh, let me play a song here.

699
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,200
Wait, hold on. Do want to play that one. That one will play tomorrow. Oh, there we go.

700
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,480
Tomorrow will be food bar Friday and I'm totally expecting to throw out a massive jam. So get

701
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:53,480
to your suggestions in, drop some songs on the drop. Drop.io slash Danny source code.

702
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,760
Reverse in the rules today. The mashup comes last on 765.

703
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,600
I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. Keep me in this

704
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,160
pain until you run that mouth. Didn't know I'd have to play and break the fuck out. And

705
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,560
it will see you slap. I'm the one right with it. And what about bringing that? Just know it's

706
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,200
red and that. So what about you? Well, I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded.

707
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,200
I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded.

708
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,920
I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded.

709
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,960
I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded.

710
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,920
I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded.

711
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,920
I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded.

712
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,920
I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded.

713
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,920
I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded.

714
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:16,920
I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded.

715
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,920
I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded.

716
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,920
I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded.

717
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:54,920
I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all

718
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:10,920
incorporate. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded. I'm fucked up all-branded.

719
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,920
No, we stay anymore.

720
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,920
You're not a movement, I'm a movement

721
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,420
He is a man, he is a man

722
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,920
God, but I can't help you, I'm a joke, I'm a joke man

723
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,420
He is a man, I'm a reader

724
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,420
God, but I can't help you, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke

725
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:24,420
I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I'm a joke, I

726
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,600
expertly mashed up by DJ Dropbase again,

727
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,220
Limbiscan and Black Sabbath.

728
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,380
Yeah, kind of angry sound that I'm looking for at the end of the show.

729
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,860
Cannot wait until tomorrow.

730
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,580
I hope you all participate drop.io slash daily source code.

731
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,100
Of course, this show you can be found at daily source code.com.

732
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:45,900
Other important homework for the Chocoheds at curie.com.

733
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,620
Of course, an atom at mevio.com is the current email address.

734
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,300
And you know, I'm one more thing.

735
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,380
I'm looking for, I'd like to make some merchandise for the show.

736
00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:04,100
And what I'd like to make is kind of like, well, be cool to have aluminum foil,

737
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:10,380
deflector beanies, but kind of like made of wool or maybe some kind of aluminum foil

738
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,380
strands.

739
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,380
It has to be certified.

740
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,660
It has to actually work.

741
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,580
But I'd like to be a garment that we could have like a DSC logo on the front,

742
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,020
maybe they work for us on the back or do not enter or something like that.

743
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,220
Just something we can all wear more when we're listening to the show.

744
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,820
I'll wear it when I'm making it if you guys promised to wear it while you're listening

745
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,820
to it.

746
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:33,420
And I'll definitely talk to you tomorrow right here on the DSC for the Fubar Friday.

747
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,420
Until then, enjoy your freedom and live with passion.

748
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,020
Another fine, medium presentation.

749
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,020
Stick it in your ear.
