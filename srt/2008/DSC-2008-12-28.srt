1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Shared Charlie 813

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
16 billion dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm guessing it's a matter of theory

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Delta was there, divided with fall

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Come on now people, let's get on to fall and work together

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Come on, come on, let's work together

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now now people, because together we will stay and never fall

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Never for a little man

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
People and people are home and they come home

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We all end up through you travel and they stay

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
All over you, let's work together

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Come on, come on, let's work together

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, you know who gather people stand

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Never for a little man or man

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, we all end up through you, let's work together

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Come on, come on, let's work together

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now now people, because together we will stay and never fall

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Never for a little man or man or man

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, come on, let's work together

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Come on, let's work together

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now make someone happy, make someone smile

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let's all work together

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's work together, let's work together

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Come on, come on, let's work together

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now now people, because together we will stay and never fall

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Never for a little man or man

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, we all end up through you, let's work together

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Come on, come on, let's work together

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Now now people, because together we will stay and never fall

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Never for a little man or man or man

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah, baby, hey, what's that?

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Ah, damn microphone

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ah, it's going to be one of those shows, that's for sure

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Come on, everybody, let's work together

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Daily source code episode 813, coming to you from the affluent suburb of Suri known as Gilford in the United Kingdom

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The very last episode from here, I presume

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I think they shut the internet down tomorrow or Tuesday

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
All right, experimental show, very excited about doing this

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I got inspiration early this morning

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Actually last night when I saw a news article

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Actually it's an editorial piece in the telegraph

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And he invited Kingdom about global warming

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And I figured, you know, here's an opportunity to roll out the stream live

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Which we know that's working, we got hundreds of people who have already been testing this with us

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hundreds, let's see, not quite as many as yesterday during no agenda yet

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But still quite a bit of people checking in on the stream

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This of course is being recorded as episode 813 in a series of programs

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And we've got the phone bridge up and working, I just want to check it for one second

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Now the way this works is if you dial in and all the instructions are clearly posted at curry.com

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We'll be talking a lot about the phone number in the system and how it works

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And if it's actually functional at all, the remember my quest is to find a way to have an entire radio station in a box

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The box being my MacBook Pro and everything pretty much being either in this

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Maybe, you know, of course you have to have three external devices

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
One is headphones, the other is a microphone

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And the third, in my case, is a MIDI controller which gives me physical faders to work with

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And some services which are remotely located, so I'm using Skype and currently using Talksue as a switchboard

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
At least that's the way I'm using it, so if you hear that you are unmuted, that means you're about to go on air

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And New York, I just want to test the quality with you

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Hello?

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
All right, so that's an example of how we wouldn't want it to work

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Louisiana, how are you doing?

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Is Louisiana on?

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I have a feeling this is going to be a rousing success, yeah Louisiana, who's this?

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So the idea is when you hear you go, actually, the little voice will tell you, I'll give you an example

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What it sounds like, hold on, here we go.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And we got to, as I played the song for a reason, we got to work together to actually make this flow

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So when you're in the call conference room, and you have to call a telephone number, then use a pin code

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And if you're not a member of Talksue.com, then I can see where you're calling from

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And at least it results in United States geography, probably not anywhere else outside of the states

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But you'll come in, you'll be on mute when you hear this.

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You are unmuted.

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That means I've just opened up your line, and I'm about to call on you, so you'll be ready to talk

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So get your Skype headset on or whatever.

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's not a very effective way to listen to the show to just sit in the talk room, hold on.

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This is what happens when I take you off air.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You are muted.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay, got it.

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So it's not a very effective way to listen to the show.

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If you're just going to sit in the Talksue room and listen.

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Certainly, if you're not going to be ready, because I will call on you if you're dialed in.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So, lots of things to talk about.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Is this, is this actually efficient?

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Is this the way you want to do it?

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But I just got to make sure that we can actually get through one show with some questions coming in

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
or some comments or contributions, I guess, is what I'm really looking forward to from the source code listeners.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Play one more song.

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm going to read this article, which will be the topic for today's program.

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And then hopefully we'll get some feedback on the voice lines.

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Dinen Spells.

92
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You money just tell me what you want me to

93
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
God, money, now me, I guess or

94
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
God, money, don't want anything

95
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Once it all, now we all can't say

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No, you can't take it

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No, you can't take it

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No, you can't take it

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No, you can't take it

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
No, you can't say

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No, that's because of you

102
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Because of you

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,500
And I see you

104
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,000
That you really pay me

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Now I can play ...

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And I see it

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You in yourайт

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's got you

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That you really pay me

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I can write down

111
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And I see it

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You really pay me

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,500
I'll tell you

114
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,000
For the one

115
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,500
You Lorna You girl

116
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:29,820
Young

117
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,340
I ruin thee

118
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,700
Again

119
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,000
Watch

120
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,500
Teacher

121
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,660
I'll tell you for the one you serve

122
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:42,140
You're going to get what you deserve

123
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,340
I've got money's nothing for the country

124
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,340
God, money's like a surfer

125
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,340
By the second one of your

126
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,040
God, money's less

127
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,540
Dancing on the back

128
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,340
So the rules are God, money's nothing

129
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,340
One choose

130
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,340
Know you can't take it

131
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,340
Know you can't take it

132
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,340
Know you can't take it

133
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,340
You're right for me

134
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,340
Know you can't take it

135
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
Know you can't take it

136
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,340
Know you can't take it

137
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,340
Know you can't takes it

138
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,340
Know you can't take it

139
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,340
Know you can't take it

140
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,340
Know you can't catch all

141
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,340
Know you can't take it

142
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,340
Know you can't take it

143
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,500
Know you can't

144
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,340
If you get it, if you get it

145
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,340
Know you can't take it

146
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,340
Know you can't trade

147
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,340
If you get it, say it

148
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,940
Down before the world you serve

149
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,340
You're going to get what you deserve

150
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,340
Down before the world you serve

151
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,840
Down above the world you serve

152
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,640
Down above the world you serve

153
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,740
Down above the world you serve

154
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,740
Down above the world you serve

155
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,740
Down above the world you serve

156
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,920
Down above the world you serve

157
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,540
Down above the world you serve

158
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,540
Down below the world you serve

159
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,900
That's let's return again once

160
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,300
Make it welcome

161
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,000
Let it go

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,920
Let it shine

163
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,140
Get a show

164
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,160
Let it all

165
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,520
Let it go

166
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,900
Let it shine

167
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,000
Give it a show

168
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,180
let it all

169
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,000
Let it all

170
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,720
Let it shine

171
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,440
Let it shine

172
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,440
And I know, like in the sky, like in the sky

173
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Give it time, give it time

174
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,440
I'll tell you for the one

175
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,440
You're going to get what you deserve

176
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,440
I'll tell you for the one

177
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,440
You're going to get what you deserve

178
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,440
I'll tell you for the one

179
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,440
You're going to get what you deserve

180
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,440
I'll tell you for the one

181
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,440
You're going to get what you deserve

182
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Nineteen skills

183
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,440
I'd like a whole daily source code episode eight one three

184
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Source of course in this entirety from

185
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,440
The source code drop drop.au slash daily source code

186
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
I got a couple of people who've dialed in

187
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
I really don't know if the phone lines are going to work or not

188
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,440
It's entirely possible that my Skype connection has too much latency

189
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,440
Because I'm also sending this stream out simultaneously all from the same

190
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Very pathetic internet connection

191
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Which is going to change in just a couple of days

192
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
God willing

193
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,440
That is if British telecom sources the phone lines properly

194
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,440
And it gets everything ready for our arrival in the new house

195
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Anyway, here's what I want to talk about

196
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
So if you want to call in

197
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
There are instructions you can find them at

198
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,440
TinyURl.com slash dsc live

199
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,440
There's also posted on curie.com on the homepage

200
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,440
But maybe it's just easier to go to tinyURl.com

201
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
Slash dsc live

202
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
There's informate while if you're hearing this now

203
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
You're listening to the recorded podcast

204
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Which means you a phone lines are closed

205
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,440
You can call but you may be charged

206
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
And you won't win, you vote won't count

207
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
I would also like to say oh yeah so and then there's

208
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Information on if you're listening to the stream right now

209
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
There's information on how you can call in

210
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,440
And I'll give you one song in a second to call in

211
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,440
If you have questions, comments, hopefully contributions

212
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
So we can have an actual dialogue

213
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
So here's the article that was published in

214
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
The telegraph in the United Kingdom

215
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
From Christopher Booker

216
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Who's a columnist for the telegraph

217
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
The title which of course caught

218
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Everyone's eye

219
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
2008 was the year man made global warming

220
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
Was disproved

221
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
And I want to read

222
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
About three quarters of this article

223
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
With you

224
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
Because I totally agree with with what he's saying

225
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
And it sparked a big debate in the comments

226
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,440
I can see this 439 comments already on the

227
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
On the article online

228
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
But it's important that we

229
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,440
At the very least discuss the crux of my objection

230
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,440
To the global warming hype

231
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Because I think there are others out there who maybe just

232
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Haven't quite figured out exactly why

233
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
It's bothering them or what is that little

234
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Thing nagging it in the back of your mind

235
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
So hopefully we'll get to that today

236
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Looking back over my column to the past 12 months

237
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,440
One of their major themes was neatly encapsulated by two

238
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
Recent items from the daily telegraph

239
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
The first on May 21st

240
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Headlined climate change

241
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
Threat to alpine ski resorts

242
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,440
Reported that the entire alpine winter sports industry

243
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
Could soon grind to a halt for lack of snow

244
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,440
The second on December 19th

245
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,440
Headed the Alps have best snow conditions in a generation

246
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Reported that this winter's alpine snow falls

247
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Looks set to beat all records by New Year's day

248
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Easily one of the most important stories of 2008 has been

249
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,440
All the evidence suggesting that this may be looked back on as the year

250
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,440
When there was a turning point in the great worldwide panic over man-made global warming

251
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Just when politicians in Europe and America have been adopting the

252
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Most costly and damaging measures

253
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Politicians have ever proposed to combat the supposed menace

254
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,440
The tide has turned in three significant respects

255
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,440
First all over the world temperatures have been dropping in a way

256
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Unproductive by all those computer models which have been used as the main drivers of the scare

257
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Last winter as temperatures plummeted

258
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Many parts of the world had snow falls on a scale not seen for decades

259
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,440
This winter with the whole of Canada and half of the US under snow looks likely to be even worse

260
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
After several years

261
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
Flatlining

262
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Global temperatures have dropped sharply enough to cancel out much of their net rise in the 20th century

263
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Even Schiller and more frantic has become the insistence of the warmest

264
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Cheered on by their army of media groupies such as the BBC and the last 10 years have been the hottest in history

265
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,440
And that the North Pole would soon be ice-free as the poles remain defiantly

266
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Ice-bound and those polar bears fail to drown

267
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,440
All those hysterical predictions that we are seeing more drops in hurricanes than ever before

268
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,440
Have infuriatingly failed to materialize

269
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Even the more cautious scientific accolades of the official orthodoxy

270
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:17,440
Now admit that thanks to quote natural factors such as ocean currents, temperatures have failed to rise as predicted

271
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,440
Although they plaintively assure us that this cooling effect is merely

272
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
Masking the underlying warming trend

273
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,440
And that the temperature rise will resume worse than ever by the middle of the next decade

274
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Secondly, 2008 was the year when any pretense of there was a scientific consensus in favor of man-made global warming collapsed

275
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,440
At long last as in the Manhattan Declaration last March

276
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,440
Hundreds of proper scientists including many of the world's most eminent climate experts

277
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,440
Have been rallying to poor scorn on that very consensus

278
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,440
Which was only a politically engineered artifact based on ever more blatantly manipulated data

279
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,440
and computer models programmed to produce no more than convenient fictions

280
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Thirdly, as banks collapsed and the global economy plunged into its worst recession for decades

281
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:13,440
Harsh reality at last began to break in on those self-deluded dreams

282
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,440
Which have for so long possessed almost every politician in the western world

283
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:23,440
As we saw in this month's Poznan Conference when 10,000 politicians officials and

284
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:29,440
quote environmentalists gathered to plan next year's son of Kyoto Treaty in Copenhagen

285
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,440
Panicking politicians are waking up to the fact that the world can no longer afford all those quick

286
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,440
Quick sock that quicksodic schemes for combating climate chains

287
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,440
Which was they were so happy to indulge themselves in more comfortable times

288
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,440
Suddenly, it has become rather less appealing that we should divert trillions of dollars,

289
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,440
pounds, and euros into the fantasy that we could reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by 80%.

290
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:01,440
All those grandiose projects for emissions trading, carbon capture, building tens of thousands more useless

291
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,440
wind turbines switching vast areas of farmland from producing food to biofuels

292
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,440
are being exposed as no more than enormously damaging and futile gestures

293
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,440
costing astronomical sums we no longer possess.

294
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:23,440
As 2009 draws, it is time we in Britain faced up to the genuine crisis now fast approaching from the fact that

295
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,440
unless we get on very soon with building enough proper power stations to fill our looming energy gap

296
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,440
with in a few years our lights will go out and what remains of our economy will jutter to a halt

297
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,440
after years of infantile displacement activity. It is high time our politicians along with those of the

298
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:49,440
U.S. of the EU and President Obama's U.S. were brought back with a mighty jolt into contact

299
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,440
with the real world. And then he goes on with a couple more things about other

300
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,440
columns that he's written which don't relate to what he's saying here.

301
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:09,440
So I love this. Anyone who listens to the daily source code pretty much knows my

302
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,440
stance on the global warming hype. I'm just bringing up some notes here.

303
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:25,440
And what I like about this article is it almost almost connects all of the dots which is where my

304
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,480
true objection comes in which is hopefully what we can talk about today. You see you got to connect the

305
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,480
dots between the financial crisis which now I personally believe it was probably engineered but

306
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,480
that's neither here nor there. It is here. We know the severity of the financial crisis. We're

307
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,480
probably only halfway through all of the crap that's going to come out. This made off

308
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:56,080
rogue Pipponzi skiing pyramid based fund is just really I believe the top of an even bigger

309
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,440
pyramid because all of Wall Street appears to have been built on this basic principle of not really

310
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,920
creating any returns but just suckering in more money or printing it and then sucking it in

311
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,640
and handing it out to people as if it were profits. So you have to take that financial crisis where the

312
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:21,920
dollar which is basically a belief system. The dollar is a piece of paper. Now hold on.

313
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:30,160
That'll help. The dollar is basically a piece of paper and it stands for something. It stands for

314
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,920
a value which is a belief system. We all believe it. The numbers are published. We all buy into it.

315
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,120
That's okay. It's a belief system. You can do it with sticks, twigs, branches, gold, silver. Anything

316
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,360
you want as long as you we all agree that that dollar has some form of value. So that paper has

317
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:55,280
value across the world that is still the reserve currency. It's what oil is traded in for the majority

318
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,280
and other currencies are pegged against the dollar. I think we can pretty much agree on that.

319
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,400
Now this belief system is coming apart at the seams. The Chinese don't believe in the dollar anymore.

320
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,240
We've seen the dollar devalue although it was not done actually in a devaluation move but we've

321
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:21,680
seen what's happened. It is going to go down even further. And of course we have the European

322
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:29,120
Union now conspiring to introduce a new form of financial system which of course can't be based

323
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,720
on probably the dollar at all but certainly not on these derivatives. So they have to come up with

324
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:44,560
something else. Enter the global warming solution which is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

325
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,880
So by reducing these emissions we're going to save ourselves from peril and doom and death

326
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,480
and destruction. And let me just say as a side note, I totally want to have some alternative form of

327
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,840
energy. I've been looking for that for a long time and I think we should absolutely be treating our

328
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:08,880
earth in a much better way. But what I do not believe in is taking this carbon dioxide emissions

329
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,920
story that it is these the reason for our planet heading towards ultimate destruction and fixing it

330
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:23,680
by creating attacks because carbon credits, which is there's an article on the drop today about the

331
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,520
bovine flatulent tax. It's no joke. The environmental protection agency is actually considering

332
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,280
doing this because your cowfarts it has carbon dioxide in the farts. You got a bicarbon credit. So you

333
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,040
got to pay for that. It's going to be like 125 bucks per cow. So the question is how do the carbon

334
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,680
credits work? Well, the concept is you buy carbon credits which means you can produce an x amount

335
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,600
of carbon dioxide and apparently on the other side of the equation somewhere someone down the line

336
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,200
is going to produce less carbon dioxide because you basically bought that right from them.

337
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,880
That no one really talks about that side of it. All you hear about is what it's going to

338
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,880
cost. The interesting thing here is that it is my belief that you will be buying your carbon credits

339
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,160
from the bank. Maybe from the central bank, maybe from the federal reserve, but that system

340
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:20,320
will that those carbon credits will be used as a form of currency, something that we can peg

341
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,840
other currencies against and of course it's a beautiful instrument because the bankers can decide

342
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,720
how many carbon credits they want to print up as it were. It'll be exactly the same. They can

343
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,920
use the same spreadsheets they use for the dollars. Let's put carbon credits in there. The

344
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:42,000
big difference here is that they control the supply of credits and you won't necessarily affect

345
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,440
the economy of a country by creating more credits. You do create the economy of the bankers

346
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,840
and they're wealth and how much more money they can collect. So that basic premise is what where

347
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:02,080
my objection to this whole global warming, hype stems from, add on to that that I know a lot

348
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:09,200
about weather. It's very hard to predict. I deal with it all the time as an airman and I don't know

349
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,520
many people if any at all who can predict the weather more than 48 hours in advance. Unless there's

350
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:23,040
some extreme circumstances, maybe a couple more days, let alone years in advance and more over

351
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:28,880
all the predictions have been exactly the opposite. So I'd like to know what you think about all of

352
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,680
this. It's important that you contribute otherwise, uh, oh, what the heck am I doing or for? Just

353
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,200
listen to me, uh, pontificating. Curry.com has the information on how to dial in your phone calls next.

354
00:24:53,040 --> 00:25:00,960
The rises as hard cries. That's the law we know now. We're occupiers. The world's

355
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:09,360
good up, scores down, and he's a higher. Prova's a low-ass soon as we go. As a rich,

356
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,160
white straw, I beat my shade of sol.

357
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,360
Take from the home, beauty, yes, take home

358
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,360
To reach the souls, narrow wide glass of goods

359
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,360
Still holding the walls to run before and more

360
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,360
And when we come close to the country

361
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,360
They kiss their ammo, they call it road rock

362
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,360
But it's a deep machine, it's so so

363
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,360
So close to the country, yes, take home

364
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,360
So close to the country, yes, take home

365
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,360
And when we come close to the country

366
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,360
They kiss their ammo, they call it road rock

367
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:33,360
But it's a deep machine, it's so so so so so so so so so so so so so so, so so so so, so, so, so so, so good

368
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:43,360
It's all done, we plan everything, we're the color of skin on the skin

369
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:50,360
We're in Lexland, ducks there at us, and soon as we begin

370
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,360
He went up the frame of thought there were it

371
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,360
I can't use it's got to do with the feeling

372
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,360
It's not where you're from, it's can they you live

373
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,360
The stuff we brought, and if we are given, a piece of the mud

374
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
Connect, we're ready

375
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

376
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

377
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,360
It's all done, we plan everything, we're the color of skin on the skin

378
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,360
It's all done, we plan everything, we plan everything

379
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

380
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

381
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,360
Oh, yeah, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

382
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

383
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:52,360
Power water, rice soup,

384
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,360
I love it, proud, proud, proud

385
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:27,320
I'm just thinking about

386
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,320
how this phone system is going to work if it's going to work at all.

387
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,320
I just want it to be completely mobile.

388
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:40,320
I don't want to set up 10 phone lines, but why can't it all be virtual?

389
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
And why can't it all just run from my Mac?

390
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,320
It should be able to, but it's going to require some habitual changes I think in the way people

391
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,320
deal with calling in and participating in shows like this.

392
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,320
Urban Dan Squad, by the way, a deeper shade of soul on the episode 813 of the Daily Source Code.

393
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:03,320
The last one coming to you from the Curry Manor, although there will be one more show for the new year.

394
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,320
Our good friend Ray is put together a year and overview of all the shows from 2008.

395
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,320
It's fantastic. He'd put a lot of work into it.

396
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:20,320
It's going to go up on on the feed probably, probably the 31st, depending on if I do anything before that.

397
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,320
So we're talking about this article in the telegraph.

398
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:30,320
Of course, talking about carbon credits and looking forward to getting some form of feedback on the phone lines.

All the information is also posted on the homepage at curry.com.

401
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Let's see if we can get a check on here.

402
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,320
It's about 3350.

403
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:53,320
You know, we've got to have been following for quite some time here.

404
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,320
And the tie in with the financial community.

405
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:02,320
I mean, no expert in global warming or anything like that.

406
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:09,320
But I love your tie and I mean, you just think that I mean, the euros and the dollars.

407
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:16,320
I mean, they're actually going to start to possibly migrate over to the whole carbon credit thing.

408
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Is that what this is probably all about?

409
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:25,320
That's what you can almost, I mean, look, I'm a conspiracy enthusiast without a doubt.

410
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,320
And I love putting those kind of dots together.

411
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:38,320
But when it actually starts to show up in the policy they're discussing, because you remember the European Union had a meeting in

412
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,320
Was it end of November there?

413
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,320
And they gave the United States a hundred days to join in with their plan.

414
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,320
And when you read the plan, it has carbon credits all over the place.

415
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,320
So if they're talking about the financial system and a new financial system they want to integrate.

416
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,320
Remember they did that like they were calling it Bretton Woods, too.

417
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,320
And everyone was getting together all the finance ministers, which of course is not really no more than a photo up.

418
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,320
Because it seems like it's pretty well laid out.

419
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:15,320
And yeah, the carbon credits, it's certainly a form of global taxation.

420
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:21,320
That's obvious from just from what it is.

421
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:31,320
But to start mentioning that in documents that deal with the financial system and whatever they're cooking up now.

422
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,320
And it can only mean that it's going to be integrated.

423
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,320
And it makes so much sense to me that this would be the way they would do it.

424
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,320
It could it could be anything.

425
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,320
But they just need a belief system.

426
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,320
You know, back in, I don't know, the thirteen high rates.

427
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,320
Yeah.

428
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,320
You say the one that's called the spreadsheet from from what we have now.

429
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,320
It doesn't make a difference.

430
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,320
It's all meaningless.

431
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,320
Yeah.

432
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,320
In history, if you go back to 12 or 1300s.

433
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,320
They used sticks with notches in it.

434
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
This is, and that was a form of money.

435
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
You just need a belief system.

436
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,320
One thing I know for sure is there is a lot of belief about global warming.

437
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,320
And I'm not denying that the earth changes, of course.

438
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:14,320
NASA just came out and said, hey, man, the solar winds are, that's kind of messed up.

439
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
Things have changed.

440
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,320
You know, it's got to be some influence there on the weather in general.

441
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,320
Well, like here in Chicago, just the other day.

442
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
I mean, it was kind of crazy.

443
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,320
I mean, we had a windshield of 20 below.

444
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,320
And then just yesterday, I mean, it was.

445
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,320
It was 55 degrees.

446
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
That was going outside of my t-shirt.

447
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,320
So, you know, that was just a couple of days spread.

448
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,320
I mean, there's definitely something crazy going on there.

449
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,320
But, you know, I've checked the John Coleman stuff.

450
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
You know, that you've pulled stuff there.

451
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
And I think it would be great.

452
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,320
I mean, he said, nobody wants to talk to a mainstream media.

453
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,320
It doesn't want to talk to him.

454
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,320
He was on this red eye show or whatever that I checked on YouTube.

455
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,320
You know, maybe get John Coleman or, you know, something on the,

456
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,320
Well, first I got to learn to start.

457
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,320
First I got to learn to start the show off without putting myself on mute.

458
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,320
And then when I graduate to the big leagues, then I can invite guests in.

459
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
So give me a couple shows to figure it out.

460
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,320
Hey, Chuck, you've been really nice, man.

461
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,320
If you don't mind hanging on, I'm just going to grab one or two colors.

462
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,320
Because people are stacking up.

463
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,320
I want to make sure everyone gets a shot here.

464
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Luke Nova, you're on.

465
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,320
Luke Nova.

466
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,320
Okay.

467
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
We'll try the next line.

468
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,320
A line list that is non member.

469
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,320
I must be a foreign call.

470
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,320
Who's this?

471
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
Now, look.

472
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,320
This is Mark in the middle of the.

473
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,320
Hey, Lawrence, was that your name?

474
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,320
Mark, M-A-A, Mark.

475
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
Mark, how you doing?

476
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,320
Your, your comments on this, this fantastic article in the, the telegraph.

477
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,320
And, I think we should.

478
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,320
And, I think you have to be lying out to, but it's not like that.

479
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,320
Now, it's, that's probably just a Skype delay.

480
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
So what do your, what do your thoughts on this article?

481
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,080
And what's the article you're talking about because I missed the last part.

482
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,880
All right man, no problem.

483
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,080
Go to curie.com.

484
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,880
The article is on the home page.

485
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,880
That's what the discussion is about today.

486
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,840
And we're trying to get some feedback from source code listeners and droppers, a

487
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,160
like LG Latte, I think, you're on?

488
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Hey, I don't understand.

489
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,160
I'm not serious.

490
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,160
Are you okay?

491
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
Who's this?

492
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
It's Liam.

493
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,160
Liam.

494
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,160
I am.

495
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,160
I am.

496
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,160
I am.

497
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,160
Liam.

498
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,160
How are you doing?

499
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,160
Yeah.

500
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,160
We're the Skype calls.

501
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,160
We're just going to have to deal with the quality.

502
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,160
You're comments on the article.

503
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,160
I'm not going to come in on it because I've been away from the PFC.

504
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,640
I took a stream of, like, really, when you started getting into all the heavy

505
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,640
stuff.

506
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,640
But this is especially a factor, just like, ringing and happy testing, say, I.

507
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,640
Okay, man.

508
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,640
I appreciate it.

509
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,640
That's very cool.

510
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,640
Take a look at this article, though.

511
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
It is written by a fellow compatriot.

512
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,640
It's very interesting.

513
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,640
It's in the telegraph.

514
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,000
It'll be in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

515
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,200
Crossposted at curie.com.

516
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
It's already up there.

517
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
You can take a look at it.

518
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,400
It's a pretty damning article about the, the hype around global warming, California, you're

519
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
on.

520
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Ah, Adam, how's it going?

521
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Good.

522
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Who's this?

523
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Ladies and gentlemen.

524
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Randy, how you doing, man?

525
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
It's not on the show.

526
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
It's my job.

527
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,400
But yeah, definitely about this global warming thing.

528
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,320
There's only, you know, I agree with you.

529
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,440
It's definitely not me or me, but there's one good, good news to it.

530
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,960
And you're seeing countries like Brazil will get a credit back because they actually

531
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,680
grow trees.

532
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,640
So, you know, I guess there's some incentive to do some good too.

533
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640
Yeah.

534
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,600
Well, I mean, that's, so you grow a tree.

535
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
What does that mean?

536
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,960
You can, they'll pay them if to grow trees, I mean, accredited someone pays real money

537
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
for it.

538
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,080
So, who's getting the money?

539
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
Where does that go?

540
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,840
Brazil just gets a little mark on their spreadsheet and tree or do they get some actual

541
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
cash?

542
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,320
I think it's probably more of a mark, but, you know, there's no actual cash in the system

543
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,320
anyway.

544
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,320
Right on, right on.

545
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Right on.

546
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,320
You know, all about, you know, at least you can grow your own credits, right?

547
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,720
They're still good news to it.

548
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,120
Well, that would be, now, I have to say that would be very interesting.

549
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,520
I wouldn't mind having the opportunity to grow your own credits, you know, that would

550
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,400
be a system that I might even be able to get behind.

551
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,440
Because that would, that would certainly change the way the way people think about the earth

552
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,440
and what they do with it.

553
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,800
That would be fantastic.

554
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
All right, Randy.

555
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
Thank you very much.

556
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,280
I'm going to play another song here.

557
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:35,960
This is something that, let's see, that was left on the drop, which was, let me just

558
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,640
find the, here we go.

559
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,960
Under the heading, bagpipe punk rock, hey, Adam, love your shows.

560
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,680
Try to spread the truth, just as you do, just wanted to send some good punk rock with

561
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,880
bagpipes, drop kick Murphy's and the real Mackenzie's.

562
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,520
All right.

563
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,920
And now, if you dial into the phone bridge on TalkShoot.com, you'll be able to hear this

564
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,520
as well.

565
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,240
Yeah, nice.

566
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:56,400
The real Mackenzie's smoking bowl, bagpipe punk rock on the Charlie can get much crazy

567
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
of that.

568
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm wondering, by the way, if my talkback system, if that actually was broadcasting live

569
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,840
on the stream, which is not the intended functionality, that could make total sense

570
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,440
of that was taking place.

571
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,840
I've got to look into some of the, some of the wiring here.

572
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,000
Let's see if we can get a couple more calls.

573
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,400
We're talking about this article in the telegraph of the United Kingdom, which you can find

574
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,320
at curry.com on the homepage, nor the New Jersey are you there.

575
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,320
Hey, Adam, how's it going?

576
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,960
I'm actually going from New York.

577
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,960
Okay.

578
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Well, you show up as Northern New Jersey.

579
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,160
But I guess that's kind of the same thing.

580
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,160
It's a new Jersey cell phone.

581
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
Okay.

582
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
Who's this?

583
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
This is Ray.

584
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,560
All right, Ray, your feedback, input, comments, contribution.

585
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,600
Um, yeah, great news about the article.

586
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,920
I think, you know, we've got to spread the word and pile on top of it.

587
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,680
Otherwise, it's just going to get pushed to the side of this guy.

588
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,840
We've got to wrote it.

589
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,840
It's just going to be, it's credited in marginalized, you know, if we get more mainstream

590
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:05,200
support for this idea that global warming, you know, is a hoax, to further push along

591
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,320
the, you know, this sort of new world over agenda, then, you know, maybe we've got, you

592
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,760
know, maybe we can fight that a little bit better.

593
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,240
You know what I think, I think the, the main thing we have to do is, whenever something

594
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,720
like this shows up in the mainstream, this is the opportunity to show it to your friends,

595
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,160
you know, mail this link out and just let people read it for themselves, you know, the

596
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,880
whole problem is is that there's lots of good, you know, I say there are no secrets

597
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,960
only information you don't, don't yet have.

598
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,880
There's plenty of good articles being written.

599
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,000
There's great journalism being performed, if you perform journalism, not quite sure, but

600
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,920
this great journalism is taking place and, but it's just not enough and it doesn't show

601
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,000
up on the home page or on the front page or above the fold and this is the stuff we just

602
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
got to say, hey, man, you know, read this, take a look into the link, you know, it's

603
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,320
easy enough to send on, it's easy enough to, God, everyone could Twitter these days,

604
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,600
just have a read, you know, and there's, there's lots of comments below, which I like

605
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:09,200
that because there's pro and and against pro and con, the article, but I think that,

606
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,600
that's the main thing people can do is just to get this awareness out there because people

607
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,040
pick up on it, you know, then you're thinking about it, then you might see another article,

608
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,400
that's really what I recommend.

609
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,680
Well, I appreciate to keep up with the look at it.

610
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,360
All right, man, thank you very much for calling.

611
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,400
Thanks for participating in the test and I look forward to hearing from you in a future episode.

612
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,680
I want to go back to Chuck for a second.

613
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,120
Chuck, you said you were in Chicago.

614
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,000
Hey, Adam, Chuck again.

615
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,000
Yeah, you're in Chicago, right?

616
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,000
Yeah, your originator of love, you mean it great here.

617
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,240
Hope you wouldn't Chuck from the Northwest side of Shai Town.

618
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,400
I bow to you and homelessness, my friend.

619
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,200
I bow to you.

620
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,320
Hey, Chuck, so what's the scene like in Chicago right now?

621
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,480
Of course, the next president is coming from your, were you born there?

622
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,360
This is your hometown?

623
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,440
Yeah, hometown.

624
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,880
Yeah, it was a pretty big deal with, you know, the whole Obama thing.

625
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,080
Quite a great scene until our governor, Radlegoy Vitch,

626
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,000
came this year a couple of weeks ago.

627
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,520
I mean, he's denying the whole thing.

628
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,440
So what are, what are people on the streets?

629
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,280
And what are the jokes that are people making?

630
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,920
There's, I mean, are people just cynical about this?

631
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,920
And they shrug their shoulders and let it go?

632
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,000
Or is there any outrage to people understand what the implications are?

633
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,280
Yeah, I mean, basically that, you know, just, you know,

634
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,520
through throughout my circles and people I talk to and co-workers and things.

635
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,920
I mean, they're, they're saying it's surprising that it hasn't happened sooner.

636
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:43,760
His wife is, as a real estate broker and, you know, apparently she's had a lot of real estate

637
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,640
dealing through, you know, contributions and things from political figures.

638
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,160
Yeah, it's, you know, it's Chicago politics.

639
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,160
My father-in-law said this is like the sixth governor he's seen, you know, in his lifetime,

640
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,880
from the Illinois that's been indicted.

641
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,120
So it's, I guess, really isn't a situational.

642
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:07,280
Really? Well, I've read a lot about the so-called, you know, the Chicago mob.

643
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,720
And we're not just talking about gangsters.

644
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,160
We're talking about, you know, the real gangsters, I guess,

645
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,680
a mayor daily would be a part of that whole clan.

646
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,840
And, you know, that's been running for a long time.

647
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,440
And it, it, I don't know, is there any, so that's what your dad says.

648
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,360
Or there are other, you know, other, other people out there who are thinking that way,

649
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,920
talking that way, any more historical references to Chicago.

650
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,560
Because when you see these things happen, you've got to think.

651
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,560
You just, you just got to stop and think, uh, maybe this is not just one case,

652
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,320
maybe it's kind of the way things work.

653
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:47,680
You know, look at the Hillary Clinton's seat in, uh, in Senate, in New York,

654
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,680
looks like Carolyn Kennedy's going to get that, you know, you know, how did you know?

655
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,280
I mean, um, you know, uh, they read it a month for some reason.

656
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,400
I don't know if it was to draw attention elsewhere, or, you know, um,

657
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:11,120
Adam, what can I say, I mean, there's actually, um, there's a book up and you link,

658
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:19,040
my father was actually got some historical, uh, information with, with the way things ran back

659
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,120
in, oh, back in the 60s, or so, with Chicago politics.

660
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:29,200
And, uh, he's got all kinds of stories directly related to Mayor Daily's father and, uh,

661
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,840
okay, it's a good stuff like that.

662
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:37,680
No, excellent. I'd love to, uh, to get that link from me. I'd love to read up on it because, uh,

663
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,080
I think there's a lot of history there that needs paying attention to.

664
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:47,680
Adam, I wanted to say, too, um, we've got to connect here to, uh, Dr. Carl Hodges and, uh,

665
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:54,320
the Seawater Foundation. Okay. We had that, uh, I'll send you the link, but, uh, he's definitely

666
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,320
on the frontier of, you know, the climate change, and, uh, he works with, uh, Jakku Sto's daughter,

667
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:06,560
Alexandra Kusto, who's quite the babe. They had a presentation here, um,

668
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,440
back in November, um, that, that actually one of my co-workers went to and he said it was excellent.

669
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,280
So, I'll get the scoop on that, you know, it'll have to, and maybe we could get him, you know,

670
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,680
I'm one of these, uh, toxic things in the future. Once you get moved into the new pad.

671
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,880
Excellent, man. Excellent. Well, send me that information. Send me a picture of her,

672
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,720
most importantly, and, uh, I appreciate you calling in, Chuck. And, uh, we'll talk to you, sir.

673
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,120
Okay. All right. So, you mean, you can hear how it went.

674
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,120
Yeah, I love you. You mean, I love you. I love you. I love you.

675
00:46:36,560 --> 00:47:06,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

676
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:16,800
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

677
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,400
I can't stand a camera so I can

678
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,900
And I touch it in the face of place

679
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,900
I'll pay fire, I'll protect it

680
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,900
I'll never touch it, go to this place

681
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:32,500
I'm a church, it will come make a breeze

682
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:37,900
The thing that's wrong, they won't be far yet

683
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:42,600
Much, a glorious rainbow face

684
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:48,000
Fall that round, pick up the colors

685
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,400
And it wraps us while we're safe

686
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,400
I'll make fire, I'll protect it

687
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,900
Never see the glorious face

688
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,420
But I can't stand a camera so I can

689
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,100
And I touch it in the face of place

690
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,900
I'll pay fire, I'll protect it

691
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,900
Never see the glorious face

692
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:12,400
I'm a church, it will come make a breeze

693
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:25,800
Fall that round, pick up the colors

694
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,700
Fall that round, pick up the colors

695
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:35,300
Fall that round, pick up the colors

696
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,800
The end is over, wrap them up

697
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,400
ship in a source card episode number eight hundred thirteen

698
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,400
Those of you who are on the screen heard it works and all and those of you who heard the podcast version

699
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,400
You just don't forget stuff you cut out all the food cut out all of the mess in the Bible

700
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,400
I actually had the phone on you

701
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,400
Okay, good enough test. I think tomorrow I have something on it

702
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,400
Again, we've got a month tomorrow and Tuesday base for the moon

703
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,400
So look out for that ray on the trolley

704
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:09,400
That's the only thing I'm gonna put up on when the new pad with all the new band with I think I have to set up pretty much figured out

705
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,400
We'll be able to do maybe one issue a day

706
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,400
So I think starting around four or five o'clock in the day is probably a reasonable time

707
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,400
And it's a third or four in the pay time

708
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,400
It's a eight in the west post

709
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,400
So you pick up another couple of four you go to work

710
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:34,400
Maybe it's, no, maybe it's better if we do it at five o'clock

711
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,400
Five o'clock people are still kind of wrapping up their day

712
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,400
You know you really don't want to work in the UK that last hour you just kind of fuck off and listen to the Charlie live

713
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,400
Maybe a dial in west coast 9 a.m. you're not really ready to get to work yet

714
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:53,400
So you know you listen to an hour of the Charlie live just to get into your day

715
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,400
New York it would be noon. Hey man, you got an hour until lunch because no one eats at noon anymore

716
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,400
So you might as well mess about and listen to the Charlie live and of course

717
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,400
Well, Australia we don't have to worry about because the show will soon be banned there

718
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,400
Okay, talk to you soon if not talk to you in the new year again

719
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,400
Keep the feed keep your eye on the feed for that ray on the Charlie year and spectacular

720
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,400
Highlights from 2008 from this program daily source code

721
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,400
Have a look at our sponsors page that lists that on every single

722
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:29,400
Every single entry every single episode in the show notes a daily source code dot com crosspost that a curry dot com and of course

723
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:36,400
Keep everything flowing through the drop seven eight pages a day. I love it. I can't get enough of it. You should be enjoying it as well

724
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,400
Drop.io slash daily source code

725
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,400
So use that freedom wisely while you still have it and live your life with passion

726
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,400
