1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
As a special year and treat, the pays are still, with an accurate presence, the TS-Jover view,

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
2008.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
On Monday, they've had an 18,000 eggs so far, of course, the idea cannot be completely accounted

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
for until the New Year has taken over.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
However, that's been an exciting year.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A lot has happened in politics, economics, and science.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But we'll go to the story as well.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In the 1380 for a long time, it's done.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And as we treat, we brush their cans and prevent it from walking up the wall.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:01:07,000
A lot of the red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:37,000
red, red, red, red, red, red, pink, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, green, red, red, red, red, red,

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,240
And this is carried over to the internet.

13
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,400
And I see, you know, I watch all of these loose change 9-11, you know,

14
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,920
all every single I watch them, but I can, I can see all the pieces to it.

15
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,760
And I can take away and I can analyze that and still keep some sanity.

16
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,920
But, you know, other people, they don't have that capability.

17
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,760
They have not been able to switch that off.

18
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,360
So that's why they get sucked very deeply into these types of stories,

19
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,200
which people forget that it's just people writing shit.

20
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,560
They can't think of themselves.

21
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,960
They can't think straight, they're jacking into the matrix.

22
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,240
All right, now everybody, it's Friday.

23
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,960
It is the 4th of January, 2008 happy New Year, everyone.

24
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,920
I couldn't, I just couldn't stay in bed any longer.

25
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,280
I had to do something. I had to talk to someone else.

26
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,880
Oh boy, okay, what an interesting week it has been.

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,680
What an interesting start to the New Year.

28
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,160
Not exactly the one that I wanted.

29
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,800
Certainly the fever is broken from this dreaded, no real virus.

30
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,880
It's, they call it the vomiting virus.

31
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,840
Now, I don't puke for those of you who have been listening to the show for a while.

32
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,200
You probably know that I do not believe I have puke in.

33
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,720
I'm going to say 30 years at least.

34
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,520
I just, I don't do it, which is okay, because there's other ways I can get rid of this stuff

35
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,880
and it's just as nasty.

36
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,720
But this seems to be like a projectile vomiting virus, which is not nice.

37
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,080
And man, I've been in and out of just drifting in and out of consciousness for the past week.

38
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,120
I've been locked up by my side because of what else can I do, but just the main bed, sweat, you know,

39
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,360
people who listen and watch conspiracy theory videos.

40
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,600
Yeah, it'll really be a real spiral.

41
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,160
Oh, this quiet, I'm New Year's Day.

42
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,120
I'll take up my bathroom a little bit here.

43
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,000
Get one.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,840
You like to walk through here, okay?

45
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,480
Hey, everybody, how are you doing?

46
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,880
Coming to you from an absolutely astoundingly beautiful, beautiful United Kingdom,

47
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,040
of course, we're in the afternoon suburb of Serino.

48
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,080
His girlfriend here in the curry manner got all the, uh, all of the windows wide open here up in the attic.

49
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,960
And we can get the birds to eat around a little bit.

50
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,480
Okay, we got the mic set up, got the, uh, comments cute.

51
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,960
How we got the music set up.

52
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,520
Good shape for the daily source code 759.

53
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,640
We just need the host.

54
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,080
Let's see.

55
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,560
Adam, Adam.

56
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,960
Adam, you still in there?

57
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,960
Oh, what?

58
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,560
Oh, okay.

59
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,240
All right, he is still taking care of his prostate cancer prevention for this week.

60
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,320
I guess nobody told him that you must

61
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,760
was to do it all in one morning.

62
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,480
Men who frequently masturbate appear to have a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.

63
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,920
Well, well, well, well, how are we feeling about that?

64
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,120
To say five times a week.

65
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,680
Okay, so I think this needs to be a part of the new sign-off.

66
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,080
Love you, mean it, great hair, hope you win.

67
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,000
Are you a five timer?

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,200
Five times a week?

69
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,640
Be honest, include it.

70
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,720
You're sign-off, please.

71
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,080
If you've been following along at curry.com, you know that I got a hydroxy booster installed on the

72
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,960
jag.

73
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,880
This was something I'm planning for a while, and I actually had to take the card

74
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,080
to the northeast corner of the Netherlands to get this done.

75
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,120
I was meeting up with a whole bunch of folks that I'd met through a Dutch radio show.

76
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,920
And everyone just kind of showed up with all the right, all the right bits and bobs of gear.

77
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,880
And we got this thing installed and it's really fantastic.

78
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,240
It's not easy to find a spot to put anything into a jaguar underneath the bonnet,

79
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,760
as it's officially called.

80
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,000
Now this hydroxy booster is essentially a pot of water that has electrodes in it,

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
the pieces of stainless steel.

82
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:32,440
And you put a current on that, which is the process of basically separating the water,

83
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,960
which gives you a hydrogen.

84
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,560
Now this is like a high school experiment, so nothing, no big there, right?

85
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,520
Except then you take a tube and you route that through a safety device called the

86
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,640
bubbler, which basically makes sure that hopefully this main device doesn't

87
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,400
implode, should some kind of fire get shot back from the engine.

88
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,360
But you basically hook it up to the air intake of your engine.

89
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:01,640
And then the theory is, is because this is now being mixed with the air and gasoline mixture,

90
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,000
that it's going to replace this highly explosive gas, which burns very cleanly by the way.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,800
A very low with any emissions, I don't think any, it's like water comes out of it after explosion.

92
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,560
After ignition, and I have no physicists, I'm just talking about what I learned previously

93
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,360
and on day itself.

94
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,240
The theory is that it then will basically use less gasoline.

95
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,520
Less petrol, because that's being replaced by this hydrogen.

96
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,920
And of course it was great for me to have to drive this 600 kilometers back on Sunday

97
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,360
to really get some measurements.

98
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,320
So when I switched this the booster on, I do have a switch in the glove compartment.

99
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:48,040
At 130 kilometers per hour there was an improvement, and actually about a 10% improvement,

100
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,360
as I went from 10.5 kilometers per liter to 11.6.

101
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,560
So a little bit better than 10%, I kid you not.

102
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,840
Now, I then try it out at 110 kilometers per hour.

103
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,360
You're not going to believe this.

104
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,200
13 kilometers to the leader.

105
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,120
13.

106
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,040
Now, there's a lot of tweaking that can be done, and I'm going to keep you up to speed,

107
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:20,280
as I progress with the trials, but I'm very, very excited that we've got something that actually

108
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,080
works.

109
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,560
So many people have said that you're crazy, you can't, but I think these people are confusing

110
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,840
efficiency with power efficiency, which I'm sure it's not, because it's like pulling 30

111
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:37,080
amp pairs of amps off of the battery with just what seems to me like a pretty simple

112
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,240
physics exercise, fascinating shit.

113
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,160
Smart man!

114
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,040
He did when the dog does he, you know, the house is empty, and maybe it's the window washer,

115
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,240
possible. Well, he gets all up, he's too old to get that upset. I wish you wouldn't do that.

116
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,760
I'm hot, I'm sweaty, I'm tired. It's been, and that hasn't even been here a week.

117
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:09,800
It's, it's, it's a rough man. I luckily, I can play a jingle here, because there is a rip on the catch.

118
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,280
Time to move over to the European Union. Here's our correspondent, come a, come a, come a,

119
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,240
come a, a blogger. Hello, I don't know if it's the carry. So you say it's in the financial

120
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,760
meltdown. I would say the world is in financial meltdown, at least the banks are. Yes.

121
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,800
And what is European Union saying? Well, that, you know, we're saying let's bail out

122
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,400
fortress bank, right? It's full of you say, it's self, because you say it was not a

123
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:52,920
glating market enough. So now let's enjoy the right on the Titanic to downfall.

124
00:09:53,080 --> 00:10:00,120
Western civilization. So long and thanks for all the fish. You know, thanks for all the fish.

125
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't think it's going to be that bad. It's not going to be pretty. That's for sure.

126
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,960
I don't think it's going to be all that bad. Holy shit. Someone's burning. Whoa.

127
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,040
A neighbor's burning shook up the windows open. It looks like an actual cloud is passing by.

128
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,200
Nice.

129
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,280
Couldn't you have waited until the wind was blowing the other way, dude?

130
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,960
Crazy.

131
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:36,760
This is about an important date that is coming October 14th, 2008. This is when we're supposed to get

132
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,880
first contact. It'll be around 2,000 of our earth miles and a met diameter. And we'll send

133
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,280
loving messages to all the people of the world. The ship will cover entire cities and

134
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,520
circle areas of the earth for three days. So there you go.

135
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,040
Oh, listen to this. Cool.

136
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,320
It's kind of an interesting video that just has a scrolling words with different sound

137
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,200
tracks under it. Let's see. They have carefully selected this time to show up and are doing

138
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,200
it out of goodwill because of the great evils behind this world that we as human

139
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:24,280
cannot see for this cause, they have decided to take action before it's too late. They do love

140
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,920
us and care for us like family. They realize most of us are blind to the truth of this world

141
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,120
and being controlled by something we do not really fully understand. Time to break free from wars,

142
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,120
famine, poverty, sickness, disease, rich and foreign. All the world sufferings that people

143
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,720
have purposely caused us. I'm Mark and Adana, my calendar, October 14th,

144
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:51,320
supposedly for three of our 24 hour periods, a ship, which will be clearly quite large,

145
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,400
will appear and this will be first contact. Apparently the first large scale contract

146
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,360
contact and will prove that indeed we are not alone in the universe.

147
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,080
So calming delusional, if you will, try and jam the pills in me, but there's nothing wrong with

148
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,280
the leave and now is there.

149
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,040
Okay, number 277, don't the share of taking off of my discretion.

150
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:10,520
Yeah, positive way to apply, breaks, you're up.

151
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:29,080
Okay, this is definitely going to be a big exciting.

152
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:48,680
Okay, one down.

153
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,200
Okay, I'm landed now.

154
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:03,480
Wow, that was kind of interesting. That was a little bit of a bounce there at the end.

155
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,600
It was quite a bit of wind. They catered to the two, number 7 notes here.

156
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,000
Thank you for your attention, Richard. I'm trying to keep you going to get centered here.

157
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,600
Okay, thank you all, number 7 notes here.

158
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,040
Wow, that was a massive, massive gust of wind I got there.

159
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,480
At the very end, wow, that was probably one of the sloppiest landings I've ever done.

160
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,160
It's an undexplained exactly what happened, but I got a huge gust of wind just as I was touching

161
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,680
down. So I got a huge gust of wind at about 25 miles an hour and just pop me back up.

162
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,920
So it's really struggling there. Together now, you may put the engine rev up a little bit,

163
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:54,680
as I adjusted the speed. Good landing. That was certainly someone exciting.

164
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:03,320
We did it. So any landing you can walk away from is considered a good landing. We'll say that was a great one.

165
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,520
And with that, I'm going to wind up this edition of the data source.

166
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:30,920
I can hear the window washer. It'll probably stick his head up right in front of my window

167
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:36,920
on the second until it should be kind of weird. There's Lisbon Treaty. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

168
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,280
Those of you haven't been following along. Essentially, the Irish voted no to the Lisbon

169
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,440
Treaty, which is a version of a Constitution for the European Union.

170
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,080
It's in the Constitution isn't even really the right word. Of course, it's the word

171
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,720
Constitution was scrapped from the Lisbon Treaty or really from the Constitution to become the Lisbon

172
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,320
Treaty. It's like a legal document that talks about a lot of things in very complicated language,

173
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:07,000
not really telling you what the hell is going on. But it will shift, I believe effectively,

174
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:13,400
about 50% of all governmental powers in each of the 27 member states over to Brussels or alternatively

175
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,120
distraught spurred. Remember, they have two seats of government and the alternate cities because,

176
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,200
I don't know, someone got pissed off and they had to do two. It's like a childish baby thing.

177
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,520
So now ministers of the European Parliament, foreign ministers are foreign affairs, they're saying

178
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,800
this treaty can't be pushed through. It can't go into effect unless all 27 member states ratified.

179
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,280
Oops, gee, do you think that if all countries had a referendum, we wouldn't have a lot more

180
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:43,400
no votes? Of course we would have because people are suspicious. They don't understand that they can't

181
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:49,080
read these documents. I tried. It's complicated. You can't get answers. There's no FAQ.

182
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,120
There you go. How about the FAQ treaty? That would be something for you guys to look into.

183
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:14,360
You can try this cowbell out. Let's don't give a nod to the hardest work in law here.

184
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:44,280
I should be really happy and I just should be bouncing off

185
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,760
the walls, which of course I am, but I'm extremely troubled by fellow Chocolettes. I'm really

186
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,480
concerned about what's going on and somewhere in September is when the world will start evolving.

187
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,320
The United States, Iran, Israel, and Pakistan. It seems like in a way we're awakening,

188
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,520
we're becoming aware of things, things are happening around us, and the worldly powers that they

189
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,880
are fighting it. The first time I've been tracking oil prices, you know, this is almost the

190
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:17,160
hobby of mine. In fact, they've been Wednesday, 253 p.m. I saw it go down yesterday, drastically.

191
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,520
But down's like 135 dollars a barrel, which to me meant something's up. In law and behold,

192
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:29,160
just as I thought this morning, where it comes that Iran is testing missiles, and there's a

193
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:35,400
rumbling in the Gulf, and of course oil starts to pop up. It is now at 8.53 a.m. in New York.

194
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:45,080
Oil is almost up to $2 a barrel, so there's clearly things going on that Iran just never

195
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:51,160
wanted to play game with the dollar currency for oil, and they've threatened to flood the world markets

196
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:57,800
with cheap oil and base that trading upon the euro. It seems like the only answer, the only solution

197
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:04,360
is to come up with a reason to go to war, and then actually go into it. Do you feel a repeat?

198
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:11,560
Is there a piece of who has been in your mind at all with the Iran? One and two, the disastrous

199
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:17,560
disastrous decisions that are being made towards fellow men, women, all the majority of them are under

200
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,960
30 years old in Iran. We must not go to war, it's country.

201
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,760
I don't need to worry about it, but it's kind of sketchy. You're responsible to ID-20 to the eye,

202
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,920
and I'm making sure that if you're ready for your plan at the US, you're willing to work for you.

203
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,920
For the attack, I run late this year, and talk to them immediately.

204
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,480
Clear program folder, tell the echo problem, you know, I'll book my alarm now.

205
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,040
Coding is really nice for radio, for it's something that ain't called highly plain security,

206
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,720
political appeal, so that you don't need one of more to the attack, which we don't know.

207
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,600
For the day that he was president of the heat, and his last day in August, January 2009,

208
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:52,600
he was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who

209
00:20:52,600 --> 00:21:01,320
was that if we don't force towards worship, day change to come clean and say honestly what's going on and why they went into the rack and why

210
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:09,320
If they don't just come clean and say it's we can have an open dialogue and work on this problem as a global population

211
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:15,320
that indeed we're in for some shitty times ahead of my fellow checklists

212
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,320
and times and times and times and times and times and times and times and times and times

213
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,320
and times and times and times and times and times and times and times and times

214
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
and time.

215
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,440
Okay, this is recording artist and poemist

216
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,080
with Anna Carmen Tyler and you're listening

217
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,900
to Delta Ciera Charlie the pod father himself.

218
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:47,400
Adam Curry.

219
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,000
In the meantime, why don't we go head down under

220
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,480
and I'm seeing that there's a very interesting pornography culture in the land of us.

221
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,920
But I really like their natural vibe and masturbation for some reason.

222
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:08,920
So it's I feel myself dot com, I shot myself dot com, which is not of the of the gun kind,

223
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,320
but of the photographic kind and beautiful agony, which is kind of funny.

224
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:20,280
But it's, it's, it's interesting that it's, um, the Australians like real people,

225
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:26,960
not fake, uh, pumped up boom porn stars doing real people things, which in honesty, don't

226
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,520
look all that good on film.

227
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:35,600
They just, you know, it's just not a good look, uh, but that's what you guys are into.

228
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:42,880
That's, uh, that to me is very interesting, um, I've seen to British porn, uh, uh, man.

229
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Yeah.

230
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,880
I bet you the Brits really like their own, their own porn.

231
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,120
I'm going to have to stop this recording, go downstairs and talk to the dog in a minute

232
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,280
because it's really putting me off.

233
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,160
The porn industry is not humongous for no reason.

234
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,320
I got a couple porn accounts.

235
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,880
I'm not ashamed to say it.

236
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,320
It's finally out.

237
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,040
Porn is going to save us.

238
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,160
Get rid of all the stupid restrictions.

239
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,720
Stop the idiotic filtering.

240
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,200
Let people let the people have their porn.

241
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Warning.

242
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,040
The daily source code has been known to influence people.

243
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,080
Let the people have their porn and not necessarily in a good way.

244
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,640
I am the root of all evil.

245
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,040
I am the root of your drinking.

246
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
There you go.

247
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,560
So please, cautiously listen to the DSC and, hey, be careful out there.

248
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,560
The source code overview, 2008, with an accurate.

249
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Teenagers.

250
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,360
Well, now you're talking my language.

251
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,160
I definitely would like to abandon my teenager from time to time.

252
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:50,880
The role places I remember all my life, though some have changed.

253
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,880
By the way, turns 18 tomorrow, I'll be party here in G-Town.

254
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:05,840
Now, God, where's the time gone?

255
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,960
Adam, here at the Portland, I was just watching John McCain and the Sarah Palin thing

256
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,680
and going, wow, it's like a magician, you know, still canker chip over here don't look

257
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:27,360
at what's really going on, you know, Cheney is in Georgia and the Dutch for her out of

258
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
our ran.

259
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,960
There's U.S. ground troops in Pakistan.

260
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,880
What the hell is going on?

261
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,120
There is no coverage in the mainstream media of this stuff and you have to hear your opinion

262
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,120
on that.

263
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,760
Well, I'm wide awake and dream my hand.

264
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,760
Hell yeah, my brother.

265
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,640
Yeah, of course, you know, that's what it's all about.

266
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,680
Well, I told you, the Republican National Convention, just like the DNC, biggest show on

267
00:24:53,680 --> 00:25:01,080
Earth, the, the, the second biggest show, the Olympics was used for the, the cowardly

268
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,640
attack of Georgia on to South Assetia, which, of course, has been distorted in, uh, most

269
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,600
of the mainstream media as Russia being the bad guys.

270
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,400
Now, Russia, not exactly the nicest guys, but they're all thugs.

271
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
Yeah, all of them are.

272
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,120
Uh, excuse me, uh, how that really felt good.

273
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,520
Ladies and gentlemen, politicians more, but being satisfied with this, look no further.

274
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
There's an answer.

275
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,960
There's a person who represents the masses.

276
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,400
Adam Curry for President, so all you nerds, jokes, heads out there.

277
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Yes.

278
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,240
No matter if you're black, white, greener, purple, no matter if you dig girls, guys, or

279
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
foreign animals.

280
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
And there is a choice.

281
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,880
Adam Curry for President, one recent candidate, had a $300 haircut, and still looked

282
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,240
like a kid doll, but not Adam Curry.

283
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,800
He's been $294 less, and just look at that here.

284
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,800
Adam Curry for President, many politicians have been confused about their sexuality, but

285
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
not Adam.

286
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,800
He can be called a big hair tag, and still say, love you, no homo.

287
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Adam Curry for President, conspiracy theories, Adam knows them all.

288
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,240
They're put security issues, then they're done that.

289
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Adam Curry for President.

290
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,880
It is time we elect a people's president.

291
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,000
Adam Curry for President, great hair.

292
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,240
He loves you, no homo.

293
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,240
We hope he wins.

294
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,440
Adam Curry for President.

295
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,720
Tomorrow night, of course, in the United States at 6 p.m. San Francisco time, the vice-presidential

296
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,720
debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin.

297
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,120
Now, I'm very excited about this.

298
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,520
For a number of reasons.

299
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,560
First of all, I want everyone once again to understand, I am not a Democrat.

300
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,960
I'm not a Republican.

301
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,640
I'm a constitutionalist, and that's why I supported Ron Paul.

302
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,360
I would have loved that if he could have been president.

303
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,920
He is now endorsed the independent candidates, Ron Bar, Chuck Baldwin, Cynthia McKinney.

304
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,520
I will make sure that I'm well informed before I cast my vote.

305
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,440
My daughter, who is now 18, is also getting into the game, and she's trying to understand

306
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
things.

307
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,360
The way I view this, what we're seeing right now, is truly the world's greatest reality

308
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
show.

309
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,880
This is not a debate amongst vice-presidential candidates who are actually going to do

310
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,040
anything, who will run anything.

311
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,000
No, it's a casting call.

312
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,720
Okay, we've had actors before.

313
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,520
We had one of the greatest actors in America became president, but McCain Obama, Palin,

314
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,040
Biden, actors.

315
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:37,640
The true agenda, what really runs them, are Wall Street, the lobbyist, it's the special

316
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,400
interest groups, it's the think tanks, and it's a shadow government, and I say evil people.

317
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,840
A very unusual noise.

318
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,000
It's something that's sort of noise, but many or many are buzzing, buzzing, say what's

319
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:07,360
the same time, buzzing, buzzing, all at the same time, and suddenly it just stopped.

320
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:14,200
It stopped as quickly as it had begun.

321
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:24,360
Three, four years of conversation that we've been having has brought me to this point.

322
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:29,640
Many of you may feel the same, some may be afraid to speak out in fear of ridicule, fear

323
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:35,960
not chuckle heads, together we're going to face the future, the light that is our destiny.

324
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,200
Welcome to the next level, welcome to the Awakening Awakening.

325
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,080
Now I say it's been a six month excursion, but the process has actually something

326
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,960
that's been taking place my entire life.

327
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,400
Imagine a world where you wake up one morning, only to realize that everything you believe

328
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,760
it, function entirely differently from the way you're perceiving it all of your life.

329
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,640
The world, in fact, with the truth as often the direct opposite of your reality, my story

330
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:09,280
is about power, three kinds of power, the power of mind, the power of rule, and the power

331
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,000
as in what makes our lights glow and keeps our vehicles moving, individually collectively,

332
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,280
these three kinds of power all insist to the inner community.

333
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:25,240
The light pollution is that energy innovation was stifled, the elu of this new black hole

334
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,320
that would power the generator to create a world of energy and motion, based on what

335
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
was.

336
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,720
See the illusion that, of course, we're thankful by it, but we know it is a trick because

337
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,120
of the context of being aware that we're watching the magic show and, of course, you

338
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,400
instantly begin to love like a god or hear like what you wake in it, take the red arrow,

339
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,800
one of the other thrown down the rabbit hole, one male and man behind the curtain, and

340
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,600
to kill three times, I say they don't speak like oh, they don't speak like what?

341
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,240
We interrupt this program to bring you this new splatter.

342
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,960
I'm very mean, in particular television is a trick.

343
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:08,040
I was a multimedia hitman, I was merely meant to keep me in slave interchange into the next

344
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:14,360
first break, reading reality in our minds, there's a servant of the energy that leads

345
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,720
to the agenda in its working, a media program, I can create content that will make your

346
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,200
brain react in a free determined manner.

347
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,680
If you really can't figure out how it works, then you understand that it becomes ineffective.

348
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,480
Once you're aware of the code, it can easily be borrowed from executing it to your personal,

349
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,680
super obscure brain, but it's not that you have an xfj with a pod task to do that,

350
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,680
and as for people with money to plan and accomplish, over the decades it built up an impressive

351
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:48,840
infrastructure of government, social and monetary systems that they control entirely, all of the

352
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:55,320
continued exploitation of us, this professional system however has one fatal flaw.

353
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,200
It must continue to grow in order for it to survive.

354
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:08,280
It needs us, the place to be embedded to it in order to prosper in what's over houses, cars,

355
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,240
and other true physical stuff has been repossessed, there'll be no more meaning to the content

356
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,520
of money. Remember that none of this machinery would have ever been created at free energy

357
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:24,120
been available to everyone. I think we are about to discover it ourselves, thanks to the evolution

358
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:31,880
of our species. I'm certain, our DNA has been definedly pre-proved to evolve into centuries of

359
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:38,760
suppression. The internet was, of course, the aliens big cock-a-cock-cock-cock-cock-cock. I simply cannot

360
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:47,160
resolve it or what design our beautiful body machinery wouldn't have added to our brains to make us

361
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:54,120
capable of even insisting our brains. If you can't help it, turn it over. You're the way most

362
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:00,920
of your still very much asleep in the reality created by the masters that own us. Many of you are

363
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:07,720
awakening, seeing the truth lies with it. It's so live to our limit. The least machine is

364
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,160
creaking under the strain of itself and food birth. It's all about the timing that the machine

365
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,440
comes from one down and now for us need to be awake prepared to take action. That's actually

366
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,720
my role to assist in your awakening and to communicate with it's push learning as I can. Now,

367
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:29,560
I don't see it or again. A rifle of praise, please, home ones, the earths and probably won't

368
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,960
come to the streets you hold. Please, tsunamis, earthquakes, and land-maser relocation.

369
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,840
Nor do I fear black helicopters in a whistening way, the snow from the night, but I

370
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,880
certainly are not going to rule any of it out. Four years of conversation. You and I,

371
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:50,760
you're responding to this one. We're going to the next level. You're awakening.

372
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,920
Yo, Ray, my brother, thank you so much for that abbreviated 781 awakening.

373
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,640
Chuckle heads hello from the Curry condo on San Francisco. This is the daily source code.

374
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:09,640
It's also an overview of 2008. We've had a curry.

375
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:15,080
All right, back to some of the news that has been aggregated by the chuckle heads themselves into

376
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,840
this program, remember, you're kind of producing it all. McCain chooses Governor Sarah Paylan

377
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:28,440
of Alaska, as is a running mate. And first of all, she's cute. I just can't help myself. I love

378
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,240
a good milk any day. So tell me, how long have you been having these delusions?

379
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:41,240
Well, doctor, it all started daily in dreams. The paranoia about the oil companies. I guess it

380
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,360
all started from from listening to the daily source code. There you go again with your delusions of

381
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:52,440
the daily source code. But, but doctor, doctor, it's a show without him curry.

382
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:59,080
Yes, you say it is a show, but you of course you have the delusions. The delusions of it being

383
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:05,480
daily. What do you mean, doctor? Well, this Adam Curry doesn't actually make a show every day.

384
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:11,320
It's sometimes a Wednesday, sometimes a food bar Friday, sometimes a Tuesday, but never it is a daily.

385
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:17,640
This delusions, they're getting in your way. You'll never recover as long as you continue to

386
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:23,800
think of this as a daily source code. So, so, doctor, what's the solution? What can I do?

387
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:31,800
Well, you must, you must come up with another word for the D in daily source code. Perhaps it is

388
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:38,680
the delusional source code. So here it is the delusional source code with Adam Curry, DSC.

389
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,040
Hey Adam, how are you doing? I'm good man, ready for one, two, three.

390
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,840
Hit us again, and this one is special, because all of the songs are from 1987.

391
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,840
So here we go, I'm here for a good. All right, got it.

392
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,880
Okay, I'm going to suck for one, two, three, yarn. I have no idea what that is. Number two.

393
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,720
That would be, this is, of course, this is the Dutch episode, George Baker's selection,

394
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,800
and a little green bag. Oh, I know these are easy. And times up and here are the answers.

395
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,240
Hi, Adam, this is Mark. This is it. Test is old about level 42.

396
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,080
How the hell would you do that? Y'all, I love it. Mark King, my favorite bass player.

397
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,680
They're all three level 42.

398
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,160
Answer number one in this week's hit us level 42, and to be with you again, and this is answer number two.

399
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,080
We back on the train, where we did a green bag. That's cool, man.

400
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,200
George Baker is answering number two.

401
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,800
That concludes hit us number 123.

402
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,440
So how did you do, Adam? Well, you surprised me, on, of course.

403
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,080
Uh, eventually figured out it was level 42 for one, two, three. Excellent. Thank you so much, y'all.

404
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,640
Like always, hit us, let me feel that's accomplished. The place to find the answers to this and any older hit us.

405
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,280
And also, the least of iTunes, so you can buy the tracks featured on the hit us online.

406
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,840
Thank you for playing, Adam.

407
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,920
Yeah, thank you for one else. Thank you for listening.

408
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,360
Many thanks to Mr. Mark King for helping me out with this special hit us.

409
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,960
Hello, Mr. Mark. Next week, I'll be back for the next hit this.

410
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,440
So until then, have a very nice week, take care, and try to think with your hearts. Bye-bye.

411
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:33,000
Um, so young was one of the many people who sent me email a couple days ago when one of the

412
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,080
greats left us just unbelievable. It was a real shock because, you know, you hear this guy

413
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:47,640
multiple times a day, if you listen any mainstream media, you know, radio or if you watch television,

414
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,200
but also on the, he really was pretty big in the, in podcasts and lots of people

415
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,440
worked with him and ordered up some of his work and his services. And of course, I'm talking about

416
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:05,000
Don Lafontaine, the man who, he didn't just, he's not just famous for the line in a world,

417
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:12,600
but he really changed the face of movie trailers, significantly, just trailers in general.

418
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,880
And really turned that into a fabulous art form and it would just seem like such a nice guy.

419
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,720
Never met him personally. I know a lot of people who work with him and it's a real real bummer

420
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:29,000
and he will be sorely missed. If you want to know who I'm talking about. And there's lots of, uh,

421
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,120
lots of shows out there that have interest from him. I just dug up too. I think I got three or four,

422
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:40,280
just so you can kind of remember in, uh, the in a way as a tribute to the great voice of Don Lafontaine.

423
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:48,760
Adam Curry was just a guy with big hair who sold his first company and thought he'd just

424
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:57,640
kick back and take it easy, but he never counted on this. Adam and Patricia, the king and queen

425
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:04,600
of the manner, or just the lady and the tramp, only on the daily source code.

426
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,640
Definitely one of my favorites. And then there's this one, of course, in the world where women

427
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:17,480
wear comfortable shoes and technology has changed the way you get your entertainment. This

428
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,760
is the pod show network. No big media. No excuses. No BS.

429
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:28,360
Somewhere he has one with my name on it, but I couldn't put my hands on it that quickly.

430
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,680
Rest in peace, Don Lafontaine. We shall definitely, definitely miss you, my friend.

431
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:45,320
Two more days until I turn 44. Hey, boy. Man, I remember, I remember my, my dad turned 40.

432
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,880
40 four years ago for me. I thought, oh man, that's ancient. And here I am now I understand the

433
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,720
world that universe is so much more open to me that I still feel like that 19 year old kids sitting

434
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:05,320
up in his attic pretending to make radio exactly what I'm still doing except on a podcast.

435
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:10,200
Dog is still barking. Fuckers 15 years old. You're going to bark yourself to death.

436
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,080
And it's just because of the window washer, right? I guess didn't pop up on the third floor,

437
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:21,240
which is too bad because that means he also doesn't get his check. Hey, the big man's wreck. WWE

438
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:29,400
that, the kid from Brooklyn, that gun. Do you people out there realize it's six years?

439
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:38,280
Six years were fighting his war. And I wrecked. We went in there under the presumption they had weapons

440
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:47,560
of mass destruction. We went in and we found ship. We found nothing. We'll tell me how come

441
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:56,280
when Saddam Hussein ran. I wrecked. I had no terrorist there. No, I'll kind of know as well.

442
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,920
No nothing. You didn't have no terrorist of anything. Soon as you got rid of Saddam,

443
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,800
all these terrorists, all of a sudden they come in direct. Where the fuck did they come from?

444
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:17,720
Added a fucking sky. The world's coming to an end. I got to right to know as a taxpayer. What the

445
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:31,480
fuck is going on over there? Anyway, think I'm bombarded. This is a big man. Don't worry. Don't worry,

446
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:39,880
shut up people. Ain't think shady. You made an up fucking money. I fucking ran, bastard.

447
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:48,680
And a big man, so ways. I'd be to say, yeah. This is the first documentary. And it was without

448
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:56,840
a doubt, in fact, what I liked the most about this documentary is that it includes my favorite pieces

449
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:05,880
of evidence about the so-called plane that allegedly flew into the Pentagon. And this is completely

450
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,920
debunked and I'm, and wildly fantastically and accurately debunked.

451
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:49,880
I may not know a lot about architectural issues. I may not know the exact the temperatures

452
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:55,960
that steel melts at. I may not understand how pancake theories and all kinds of other

453
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:05,480
non-demolition, non-demolition building collapses, how they work. But I do know a thing or two

454
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:15,400
about flying. And the evidence is extremely clear that the flight data recorder from the flight

455
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:21,400
that supposedly hit the Pentagon shows improves. This is data coming from the National Transportation

456
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:30,200
Safety Board, the plane flew over the Pentagon by about 480 feet. And this is because they messed

457
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:36,120
up when doctoring the tape, they forgot to set the pressure setting for that day, which of course

458
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:43,880
is a historical evidence, which we know. And so it decides multiple very experienced

459
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:50,520
airmen coming out and saying, but signs at the maneuver that was made is impossible to make for

460
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:57,320
the most experienced pilot. The speed that was registered at the low altitude is physically impossible.

461
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:05,320
It is physically impossible, okay, physics. There's a lot of physics, but at least the NIST is

462
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:11,320
not tried to debunk these physics yet with more dumb and bad and fraudulent signs.

463
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:37,000
They'll take your right to go in your own hands. Even show business friends of French President

464
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,840
and current European President Nicolas Sarkozy were making jokes about how stupid we are,

465
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,480
how lame ass we are as Americans that were letting our government do this to us.

466
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,280
Same type of noises coming out of Italy as well, and I'm thinking, man, just leave it to the Italians

467
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,800
to show us how lame we actually are.

468
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:08,680
I know, but I don't know, I never waited with the nice, I know how hard it is to always walk out in the

469
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:19,960
light, and it's an incentive to load a vacuuming, it's an incentive to hang on to the

470
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:30,280
911, the attack on the towers, the pentagon, that it was an inside job, it was controlled by the

471
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:36,760
American government, it was what someone called a false flag operation, and it is far and wide,

472
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:42,360
and it's extremely vast, crying that is taking place here, a global crime that wasn't just

473
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:51,160
Americans in these towers, it is okay, it is okay to now say that you have feelings about this

474
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:57,240
monstrosity, that you feel that something is a miss, that you, you may not know it, you may not be

475
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:03,320
able to put your finger on it, but first it's okay to just say it, it is okay. It's an incentive.

476
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:09,480
You're no longer going to be ridiculed for this because around the world, all the way up to

477
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,400
the highest levels of government, people are now talking about this, the media, the mainstream

478
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:22,120
media will not discuss it, will not show any of these videos, but it's okay for you to start

479
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,560
investigating and start talking about it with your friends, it's now seven years on and the time

480
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:35,000
has come to do this, please let them see that there is an alternative conspiracy theory,

481
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:54,520
but seven years after the fact, and they have, in this case, let's just focus on George Bush and

482
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:00,440
particularly Dick Cheney, they have already advanced their agenda so far, we've seen what's happened

483
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:07,080
in South Assetia, and it's all interconnected right into the financial crisis, which is taking place

484
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:12,520
in front of our very eyes over the weekend, Lehman filed for bankruptcy chapter 11,

485
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:19,560
we've had Merrill Lynch being sold to Bank of America, and now there are huge put options

486
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:25,640
on a city group, so that may be the next target to be taken down, it's all interconnected, all of

487
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,120
this is a part of the same system, all of it being orchestrated by a reasonably small

488
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,840
number of people, but it's all the same and you know how they are, you know how they're connected

489
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:43,000
and they are so connected to each other, even through family bloodlines they're connected, it's just

490
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:51,240
amazing, so one of the ways to fix a financial crisis is to start a war, hold on here it comes,

491
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:01,560
I thought I had the sneeze, but I went away, crap, I hate that,

492
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,760
and he's saying that a debate is now needed on how far Britain should go,

493
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:30,760
and identifying potential offenders, given that some experts believe it is possible to identify

494
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:37,160
future offending traits in children, as young as five years old, we have to find who are possibly

495
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:43,160
going to be the biggest threat to society, and kill them, incarcerate them, you have bad DNA,

496
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,760
you five year old child,

497
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:52,600
I'm a new work for us, we can live in our island, whenever the ground's maybe,

498
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:58,200
so really, so now we can tell through DNA that you're a bad person, this is spot fly,

499
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,120
we know it, they're going to come with your children, so this of course is my call once again

500
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,600
that I think we need to stand up and protest, oh wait a minute, you're not allowed to protest

501
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:12,440
without a license in the UK, I'm sorry, no no one's interested, I'm certainly ready for it,

502
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:20,760
friends, you will, then all of a sudden we have hundreds of people appeared with these

503
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,320
t-shirts and then we're going to find this film we all dispersed before the cops can do anything,

504
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:35,080
you want to rock and roll man you want to have some fun,

505
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,080
I'm glad you're here.

506
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,080
I'm good.

507
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,080
800 more than 800 shows from the D.S.C.

508
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,080
I'm going to wake up.

509
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,080
I put it on the drops and it all's at own curry.

510
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,080
Red Roger's back and it's good to see.

511
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,080
Still here and stuff from C.S.B.

512
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:58,080
While we're at it, don't forget about another little song from Young Boyle.

513
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:03,080
800 more than 800 shows from the D.S.C.

514
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,080
And there's one more thing we need.

515
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,080
A little more lady to you.

516
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,080
You don't have to see you in a chrydy.

517
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,080
Hey everybody, how you doing?

518
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:20,080
Your buddy, your fellow chuckle head here in San Francisco, Northern California.

519
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,080
What a week it has been.

520
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,080
I gotta tell you.

521
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:30,080
I'm so fried at this point that I'm basically just...

522
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,080
I'm almost floating.

523
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,080
I swear to God.

524
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,080
It's outrageous.

525
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:40,080
What the stuff that's been going on in this past week for the past three hours have been reviewing

526
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:44,080
the drop, I've been reviewing notes that have been taking throughout the week.

527
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:49,080
If I actually wanted to cover everything and almost every single link,

528
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:53,080
every single sound file, every YouTube and bed at video on the drop,

529
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,080
it's all great.

530
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,080
It's all relevant.

531
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,080
It's all stuff we should be talking about.

532
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:03,080
If I want to cover all of that, we would have a six-hour show.

533
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:07,080
Got Ray on the Charlie coming up for you, which means we'll have something hokey going

534
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,080
back to 19.

535
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:12,080
I don't even listen to them anymore because I just want to be surprised

536
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,080
but whatever Ray puts together some kind of song from the soundtrack

537
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:20,080
in my life and usually some embarrassing moments from my past career.

538
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,080
So we'll get to that in a second.

539
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,080
Still staying with the financial crisis.

540
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,080
Something up, it is not a Wall Street crisis.

541
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,080
It is a global banking crisis.

542
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,080
And I say specifically banking because it's their system.

543
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,080
And we're just attached to that system.

544
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:43,080
And it's come crashing down and just briefly on this bailout bill.

545
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,080
This is a bill about power.

546
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:54,080
And it went from three pages to 106 pages to 451 pages in the time of what?

547
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,080
What was it?

548
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,080
Not even two weeks?

549
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,080
No, not even one, not even one full week.

550
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,080
And this is really a bill that is good for the bankers.

551
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:08,080
They are bailing themselves out before everything comes crashing down.

552
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,080
What they're doing is they're creating inflation,

553
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:16,080
which could lead to hyperinflation, which means prices go up way way up.

554
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,080
And you buy less for your money.

555
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,080
Anything could happen at this point.

556
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,080
And the bankers got themselves out.

557
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:26,080
I'm just a kid from America.

558
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:30,080
You know, hey, Europeans, we're all the stupid people live.

559
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,080
Yeah, I want them.

560
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,080
And I could figure it out.

561
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,080
It's really not that hard.

562
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:39,080
And when you understand what's going on and I was watching C-SPAN,

563
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,080
a lot of C-SPAN actually poised that fantastic.

564
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:52,080
Watching Pelosi holding the bill out in front of reporters in a nice little blue box before

565
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,080
she sent it off to Bush.

566
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:58,080
We had Bush and Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury standing on the capital steps.

567
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,080
Looking like two thugs, some little thugs.

568
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:10,080
Haha, we did it.

569
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,080
Let's see.

570
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:16,080
And just along actually this kind of leads into the economy in general,

571
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,080
but American Express, which of course we know is a credit card company.

572
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,080
Well, most people would notice a credit card company is now become a bank,

573
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,080
so they can also receive money from their buddy, Paulson.

574
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,080
And the meantime, had the foreclosure slowed down,

575
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:34,080
has it been easier to get a loan for a card purchase?

576
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,080
How's your business doing?

577
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,080
This is the stuff we need to be looking at.

578
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,080
Tens of thousands of people being laid off sometimes on a daily basis.

579
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:47,080
So there is no, as I say, there is no free lunch.

580
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,080
And it's time for someone to step up.

581
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,080
Let the auto industry fail.

582
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,080
I definitely think we should take care of the pensioners,

583
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,080
so we'll split the difference.

584
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,080
You know what?

585
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,080
There's new car companies.

586
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,080
There's tons of them.

587
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,080
Give them incentives.

588
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,080
Let them take over in the marketplace.

589
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:08,080
It's not like the entire auto industry is dead.

590
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,080
There's tons of things we can do.

591
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,080
Tons.

592
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,080
Bailing out.

593
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,080
Not the option I'm looking for.

594
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,080
Not a good idea.

595
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,080
Because I bought it high.

596
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,080
Watched it blow.

597
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,080
Rating high.

598
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,080
There you'll know.

599
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,080
In it with a thing.

600
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:58,080
It goes doesn't really matter to me.

601
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,080
To me.

602
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,080
Mama.

603
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,080
Just killed my friend.

604
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,080
Coded studios instead.

605
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,080
Pulled the trigger now it's dead.

606
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,080
Mama.

607
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,080
I had just begun.

608
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:26,080
These studios have blown it all the way.

609
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:35,080
I still want to buy.

610
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,080
Tons.

611
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,080
We should never let them go open it up.

612
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,080
I see a little silly way to open.

613
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,080
I can't but I can't even say the old market.

614
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,080
Super senior.

615
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,080
Super senior.

616
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,080
Super senior.

617
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,080
I m on a surprise studio fantasy.

618
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,080
I'm on a surprise studio.

619
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,080
Fantasymu.

620
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,080
Easy. Come, easy. Come, lift me.

621
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:26,080
Come. Come. Come. Come. Come, again.

622
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,080
Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come.

623
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,840
Where am I?

624
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,200
Where are you?

625
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,780
Where am I?

626
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,260
Where am I?

627
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,880
Where I am?

628
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,000
Mama Mia!

629
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,720
Mama Mia!

630
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,500
Where am I?

631
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,640
Where am I?

632
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,000
Where am I?

633
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,280
Where am I?

634
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,040
Where am I?

635
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,280
Where am I?

636
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,900
Where am I?

637
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:50,100
Where am I?

638
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:54,020
Where am I?

639
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,580
Where am I?

640
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,980
Here are these humans.

641
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:00,980
I can't do this to me baby

642
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:04,980
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here

643
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,980
I can't do this to me baby

644
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:13,980
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here

645
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,980
I can't do this to me baby

646
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,980
I can't do this to me baby

647
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,980
I can't do this to me baby

648
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,980
I can't do this to me baby

649
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,980
I can't do this to me baby

650
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,980
I can't do this to me baby

651
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:29,980
I can't do this to me baby

652
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,980
Don't press really matters

653
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:39,980
No liquidity

654
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,980
Lifting really matters

655
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:46,980
Don't press really matters

656
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,980
No liquidity

657
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:52,980
Lifting really matters

658
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,980
Go away

659
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:04,980
It matters, and no praise really matters to me.

660
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:24,980
The Jeff Smith Financial Rhapsody.

661
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,980
Thank you, darling.

662
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:29,980
My lovely wife just brought me up.

663
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:34,980
Just an official club sandwich.

664
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:42,980
Oh, that sounds like a BLT.

665
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,980
Thank you, darling.

666
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,980
There you go.

667
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:55,980
Ray, on the Charlie, my brother, thank you so much.

668
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:08,980
So for those of you not quite familiar with the concept of the soundtrack of our lives,

669
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:13,980
the idea is when you hear these songs and you think about them, you're like, oh, man.

670
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,980
I know exactly where it was when I first heard that.

671
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:22,980
And it does not have to be the first time you heard it because when I hear this song, I always think of the soundtrack of my life.

672
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:25,980
I'm hungry.

673
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,980
I'm hungry.

674
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,980
See why?

675
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,980
Everybody, you want to say something?

676
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:32,980
What's the world like?

677
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,980
Never mind, the weather, what about the money?

678
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:35,980
Let me be careful.

679
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,980
This is where I come from, okay?

680
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:38,980
This is my roots.

681
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:39,980
What's this?

682
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:40,980
It's 100 dollars.

683
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:41,980
You come a long way, son.

684
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:45,980
From Z100 and the free money, buddy.

685
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,980
Ray, hey, boy, I was a fucking robot.

686
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,980
Listen to me, part of the machine.

687
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:53,980
I need to eat a reason for favoring New Jersey.

688
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:54,980
I don't believe it.

689
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,980
Hey, hey, hey, hey, my son, hey.

690
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,980
Did you change your birthday?

691
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,980
Hey, my son, hey, my son, hey, my son.

692
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:01,980
Oh, congratulations.

693
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,980
Would you like a bunny as a present?

694
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:05,980
Yeah.

695
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:06,980
Well, congratulations.

696
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:07,980
I'll give you that one too, okay?

697
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:08,980
Thank you.

698
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,980
Hey, who plays at least 10 songs in row every hour, Tina?

699
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:12,980
Leave my house safe.

700
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:13,980
soundtrack to my life.

701
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,980
At this song, he's number one.

702
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:19,980
See 100, 100 songs of this week's road trip here.

703
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:22,980
The drama, folk.

704
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:27,980
Adam Currie's soundtrack to my life takes a trip down memory lane to 1990.

705
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:28,980
Okay.

706
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,980
Adam just a little experience.

707
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:31,980
I'm just curious.

708
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:32,980
Can you still do this stuff?

709
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:33,980
You made it a little higher.

710
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:34,980
I'm Adam Currie.

711
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:35,980
I'm not cutting it.

712
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:36,980
I'm cutting it.

713
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:37,980
I'm cutting it.

714
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:38,980
No.

715
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:39,980
It's a wrap up.

716
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:40,980
One, one, one.

717
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:41,980
I don't want to be fun.

718
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:45,980
To be that C-1 100 and the guy is showing it to her.

719
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:48,980
As you come from, you've still got 16 seconds left.

720
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:49,980
Good.

721
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:50,980
As you see, he's Adam Currie.

722
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,980
Make sure you call the free body hotline at 112-4-2-0.

723
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:54,980

Right now, it's the bomb one.

727
01:00:58,980 --> 01:00:59,980
It's the material girl.

728
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:00,980
It's banana one.

729
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:01,980
Boom.

730
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,980
See.

731
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:03,980
100.

732
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:04,980
Yeah.

733
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:05,980
Yeah.

734
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:06,980
Yeah.

735
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:07,980
Yeah.

736
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:08,980
Yeah.

737
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:09,980
Yeah.

738
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:10,980
All right.

739
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:11,980
Yeah.

740
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:12,980
Yeah.

741
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:13,980
I still got it.

742
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,980
soundtrack to my life.

743
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,980
This was ends with a break on national radio.

744
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:19,980
Star of his profession.

745
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:20,980
I don't remember that.

746
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:21,980
Yeah.

747
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:22,980
Yeah.

748
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:23,980
We got it.

749
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:24,980
We need to do it.

750
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:25,980
We need to do it.

751
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:26,980
Yeah.

752
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:27,980
Yeah.

753
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:28,980
Please, welcome.

754
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:29,980
Oh, man.

755
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:30,980
Better.

756
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:31,980
Very necessary.

757
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:32,980
Hope you.

758
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,980
When you hear something, why don't you wake me up before your go-go.

759
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,980
Maybe something drew that into the two folly?

760
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:38,980
I won't.

761
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:39,980
All of that's right.

762
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:40,980
They want me to do the show in English.

763
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:41,980
I remember that.

764
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:43,980
50.

765
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:44,980
50.

766
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:45,980
50.

767
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:46,980
50.

768
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:49,980
But those of you who don't believe my name really is Adam Curry.

769
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,980
Those of you who of course know me from town down TV.

770
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:54,980
Kind of like I say this evening in an interview.

771
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:55,980
Right?

772
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:56,980
He's not coming back.

773
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:57,980
See you again.

774
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,980
There's a dire story.

775
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:00,980
I'm hosting websites.

776
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:04,980
We can find everything about English or non-violence.

777
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:05,980
Hey, what's this?

778
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:06,980
Hello.

779
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:07,980
Better right.

780
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:08,980
Now.

781
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:09,980
Hey, Tom.

782
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:10,980
Good to hear from you.

783
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:11,980
I'm a little bit excited.

784
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:13,980
My name is Henry of an English and I'm a singer.

785
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:14,980
I'm a singer.

786
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,980
Have you been visiting a ring out of the game?

787
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:17,980
Yeah, I'm guilty.

788
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:18,980
The chick is for some old age.

789
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,980
I'm too real bad of him.

790
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,980
He's got all my old taste.

791
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,980
I'm a welcome man.

792
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,980
For a collection.

793
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:26,980
Can I eat an egg?

794
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:27,980
I don't remember.

795
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:28,980
Big story.

796
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:29,980
Eat the egg.

797
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:30,980
Thanks Tom.

798
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:31,980
No problem.

799
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:32,980
Thank you.

800
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:33,980
Thank you.

801
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:34,980
Thank you.

802
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:35,980
Thanks so much for all the time.

803
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,980
You said I'm going to reply to the tag.

804
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:38,980
I'm going to continue with that.

805
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:39,980
I agree.

806
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:41,980
Thank you.

807
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:42,980
Thank you.

808
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:43,980
Thank you.

809
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:44,980
Thank you.

810
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:45,980
Thank you.

811
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:46,980
Wow.

812
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,980
This guy is so much working.

813
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,980
And I'm so glad he's doing that.

814
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,980
Soundtrack to my life.

815
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:53,980
Raymond.

816
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:57,980
Thank you so much for choosing that as a song part of the soundtrack to my life.

817
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:02,980
Because it absolutely is one of those entries that does bring back fantastic memories.

818
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:05,980
I know exactly where I was when I heard the song for the first time.

819
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:07,980
I know because I was 15.

820
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:11,980
And I was just become sexually active.

821
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,980
I'm pretending not to hear the dog.

822
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:16,980
So let's keep educating ourselves.

823
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,980
I mean, obviously, I don't know everything.

824
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:23,980
I'm just a little boy here with this little Mr. microphone doing my thing.

825
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,980
Rolled out the voice mail lines.

826
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:26,980
Listen to the savance.

827
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,980
And from time to time, they're pissed off.

828
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,980
And he is another perfect example.

829
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:31,980
Because he's back ladies and gentlemen.

830
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,980
Let's have a word with the nylon.

831
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:39,980
Spreading the news with the smile on where the roll ranks.

832
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:40,980
We go whole light.

833
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,980
Let's listen for a while tonight.

834
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:44,980
Yeah.

835
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,980
Welcome back to New Yorker from London.

836
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:47,980
Hey, Adam.

837
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:48,980
It's my one.

838
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:51,980
I've got three things to pose to you today.

839
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:53,980
Well, if you know, by the way, Nylon, when you call in,

840
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,980
you've been absent for a couple of weeks.

841
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:56,980
Would you mind just saying,

842
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:57,980
Sorry.

843
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:58,980
I haven't heard from me.

844
01:03:58,980 --> 01:03:59,980
I've been busy.

845
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:00,980
Here's what's going on.

846
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,980
You know, we wouldn't mind if you told us what the hell you do by now.

847
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,980
You know, you hide behind your acronym.

848
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,980
But who are you, my friend?

849
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,980
Are you a truce of on tour?

850
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,980
An agent from foreign countries?

851
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:13,980
Let's get to the F.A.C.

852
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:14,980
Just a few.

853
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:15,980
You're going to be grand something.

854
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,980
Let's go back to what I've been at you for the last year,

855
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,980
which is the daily source code is a misnomer.

856
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:24,980
It doesn't exist.

857
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:29,980
So I need to hear from you since you don't do a daily show.

858
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,980
What is your contract with me and the audience?

859
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:35,980
Contract contract.

860
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:36,980
Contract.

861
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:37,980
Contract.

862
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:38,980
Contract.

863
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:39,980
Let me see.

864
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,980
Where's the check from Nylon, everybody?

865
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:42,980
It must be around here somewhere.

866
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,980
I'm, ah, G.

867
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:45,980
Are you out of your mind?

868
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:47,980
You're, I forbid you from listening.

869
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:49,980
You're not allowed to listen to show any more Nylon.

870
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,980
You contract.

871
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:52,980
Dude.

872
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,980
I've been doing this for four years.

873
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:58,980
762 episodes and then some before I started counting.

874
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:02,980
I'm doing it because I like it because this is a circle of friends.

875
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:04,980
I don't need to have freaking contract with you.

876
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:05,980
You deck.

877
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:06,980
Members.

878
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:07,980
Listening.

879
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:08,980
What is your contract to us?

880
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,980
When can we expect to show from you?

881
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,980
And when will you live up to your commitment?

882
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:15,980
I don't have to commit to anything to you.

883
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,980
At all.

884
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,980
How would the arrogance?

885
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:22,980
Where's your contract?

886
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:24,980
See.

887
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:25,980
Boy.

888
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:29,980
Or we brand into the weekly source code, whatever it is.

889
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:31,980
But we need a commitment.

890
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:34,980
I think we deserve a commitment you're not daily.

891
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:39,980
And we like I like to know anyway is what is your commitment to us.

892
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:43,980
I also note that typically between the Thursday and a Monday.

893
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,980
Hold on, let me just get to that commitment.

894
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:49,980
When I do a show, my commitment to you is I'm going to do the best damn show I can.

895
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,980
And if that's not enough for you, screw you.

896
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,980
It's a short overview.

897
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:55,980
2008.

898
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:57,980
We've had him carry.

899
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:58,980
The revolution has started.

900
01:05:58,980 --> 01:05:59,980
The revolution continues.

901
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,980
It continues in the hearts of minds of hundreds of thousands.

902
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:09,980
If not millions of Americans who are waking up and understanding that there are things going on that do not make sense.

903
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:11,980
That things that we need to keep our eye on.

904
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:13,980
Because hey, these fuckers work for us.

905
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:14,980
Remember.

906
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:15,980
Smart.

907
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:18,980
I'm pretending not to hear the dog.

908
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:31,980
But I still believe that the true powers that be the true owners of the earth, these are the families that are essentially behind the failure, this financial failure.

909
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:33,980
They do it to grab real assets.

910
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:35,980
They have they have the hands on all these banks.

911
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,980
And so when you lose your house, they get it.

912
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:38,980
They're bastards.

913
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:39,980
Total bastards.

914
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:40,980
And they've done it before.

915
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:43,980
And they'll continue to do it unless we wake up and stop it.

916
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,980
But this time we're going to witness it.

917
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:51,980
So I'm pretty sure I'm going to be doing the show for at least the next 10 years.

918
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:52,980
Maybe not daily.

919
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:55,980
But I'll certainly be doing the show.

920
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:56,980
You know what?

921
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:57,980
I'm going to turn the noise gate on.

922
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:58,980
Then I just won't hear him anymore.

923
01:06:58,980 --> 01:06:59,980
Hold on.

924
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:01,980
That's going to help.

925
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,980
Now I don't hear him anymore.

926
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:05,980
I do like that though.

927
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,980
Because first of all, it isn't the order.

928
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:14,980
If you look at valuable currency in order of appearance in world history, gold first, oil second, and drugs.

929
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,980
Ah, drugs may have been early on.

930
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:17,980
Ah, who knows.

931
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,980
But I do like the GOD acronym.

932
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:20,980
That's pretty funny.

933
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:21,980
Okay.

934
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:22,980
From now on, that's official.

935
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:26,980
True currencies the world, gold, oil, and drugs.

936
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:30,980
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new president in the United States of America.

937
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,980
Barack Hussein Obama.

938
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:35,980
And I could not be more pleased for a number of reasons.

939
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:41,980
First of all, I'm always very happy when I see my fellow countrymen.

940
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,980
And what a diverse bunch we are.

941
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:48,980
When I see them really bonding together, really happy.

942
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:54,980
Extremely emotional about the success of Barack Obama.

943
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:57,980
The success of his campaign and becoming president.

944
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:59,980
This is the stuff that dreams are made of.

945
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:05,980
Certainly in the United States of America and regardless of who would have won this election.

946
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:10,980
When a country gets behind something like that, at least this is the way I was brought up.

947
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,980
You're right along on board.

948
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,980
You know, we give up our differences.

949
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:15,980
We don't hold the grudge.

950
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,980
We're good sportsmen.

951
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:19,980
And we support our president.

952
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,980
Because everyone deserves a clean shot.

953
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:26,980
And I'm also extremely happy that America really got what he wanted.

954
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:29,980
And we've got the whole, the whole kitten kabuddle.

955
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:33,980
We've got the house, the Senate, the executive branch.

956
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,980
Everybody in the program.

957
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:37,980
Because there's a reason to reach out.

958
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,980
Everybody in the program.

959
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:43,980
Everybody in the program.

960
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:45,980
And feel the hope that we've been waiting home.

961
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:47,980
Everybody's ready.

962
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,980
Everybody in the program.

963
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:52,980
Everybody in the program.

964
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:56,980
Everybody in the program.

965
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,980
This is exactly what America wanted.

966
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:00,980
For that, I'm extremely happy.

967
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:04,980
And I want to ride this wave of euphoria for as long as it lasts,

968
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:13,220
last, which may be only another hour because joblessness, the ADP, unemployment numbers are coming

969
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:18,340
out in a couple hours. But regardless, I want to ride that because when this country, even though

970
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:22,580
I'm not in it right now, when America really bonds together like that, this is when we can make

971
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:30,020
great things happen. Now, am I happy that the Barack won? Well, no, I wouldn't have been happy

972
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:36,500
if John McCain won either. I believe that both of those candidates are being essentially

973
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:42,100
run by people in the background and on this program, we discussed many of those names. So,

974
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:49,780
I'm digging it. I really am. And this may sound weird to a lot of Europeans, but this is exactly

975
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:54,980
the way we respond to America after a presidential election. Hey, that guy won the one that you

976
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:58,820
were for. I was against, doesn't matter. He's our president. We're going to support him. We're going

977
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:05,860
to let him take the shot and do the best he can. Now, of course, sounds a lot like what we've had

978
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:12,260
for the past couple of years, but it could change. That's what has been promised us above all,

979
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:20,340
change and hope. Well, that part we've got down Pat. We're good to go. So, we'll just launch

980
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:25,300
right into it. There's still a lot of things not going well in the world. And these are the things

981
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:33,700
that we hope will change. And I think we should be right there. Hounding our incumbent

982
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:41,060
representatives and the new ones coming in. And it is quite spectacular that it will be completely

983
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:45,940
democratically run now. Is it all really one party, other different fractions within the party?

984
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:50,660
Who's a good guy? Who's not a good guy? Because I think there's good guys and girls and bad guys

985
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:57,860
and girls and we'll see how the puppet masters continue to tug at the strings in the background

986
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:03,940
and if we really get what we want. So far so good. Step one has been taken again. I could not be happy

987
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:05,940
if we're good.

988
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:31,860
Dear Mr. Cart. Yes. I have listened to several episodes of your podcast

989
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:37,380
No Agenda. Yes. I must commend Devorek on his excellent work. From what I've heard thus far,

990
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:44,020
I must say that you often come across as an egocentric asshole. You seem to think you are American

991
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:49,460
Dutch and British. Yes. I understand you have lived in each of those countries. Yes. However,

992
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:53,860
you will not British in the slightest sense. Oh. And it's insulting that you would ever try to

993
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:58,740
insinuate that you are. Okay. Just listen to yourself. Yes. And that's so good English that's

994
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:05,220
abused from your mouth. You talk utter rubbish. You are an idiot. Yes. You are disgusting. Yes.

995
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:10,660
I hope one day you can see how much of a scumbag you really are. You know what? You really tell

996
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:15,860
you really made my day. Hey Adam, how you doing? This is David Rhode Island and just

997
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:21,300
want to give you an update. Yeah. The bank and end of it. Yeah. Hell yeah. Good work Adam.

998
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:26,500
I was waiting for that. Yank the bank. It's the central banks and the federal reserve.

999
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:33,780
Federal reserve now. Ben Bernanke, he's saying. Oh, we can't do it on a motive bailout.

1000
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:38,820
Yo, this is only for my banker buddies. This is not actually to improve the world or help the

1001
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:44,340
United States populist. No, no. Fuck you if you're going to be out of a job. We don't want you to have

1002
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:52,180
our money. It's ours. That's what's going on. You watch. Poor old schmucks there in capital hill

1003
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:55,700
thinking they're going to do some good. They're getting yanked on both ends of it.

1004
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:04,180
First of all, by the auto makers. And then by the fed who does not want to give our money to

1005
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:10,260
anyone but themselves. It's so blatant, so clear. Wake up people. The new world order is forming.

1006
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:19,620
And we've got to stop them. Yank the bank and the fed. And take back the power of your own

1007
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,620
government wherever you are.

1008
01:13:49,620 --> 01:14:18,100
I've always loved the Matrix soundtrack. The wake-up.

1009
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:27,860
Oh, man. Great song that is. Well, what's been going on is it's just been crazy busy. Of course,

1010
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:33,300
the move is starting to spin up. We got the keys to the new concept, which I think indeed is going to

1011
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:39,300
be named the Curry Terrace. It just has a nice ring to it. I got a great office. I cannot wait. So this is

1012
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:48,980
of course, as a terrace house in London. Very typical. And so you have a, you walk up a short

1013
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:53,380
flight of steps to walk into the house. And then that's where you have the living room. And we've got

1014
01:14:54,740 --> 01:15:00,020
an overhang and conservatory at the back. And you know, it's, it's really fantastic. You can also walk

1015
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:05,220
down the steps from the front or internally, of course. And on the, I guess that would be the Sutara

1016
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:11,940
is at the back is a huge kitchen with another aga, which I'm very happy about. Of course,

1017
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:16,420
we've got the teenager apartment out back, which is right outside of the kitchen. So, you know,

1018
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:20,180
she can come in and get a midnight snacks. And we have the whole house to ourselves. Now,

1019
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:25,380
on the front of that is where I get my new office. It has very high ceilings, which I desperately

1020
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:30,500
need because I've been doing. Finally, I'm getting into video production. It has taken me several

1021
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:35,380
years. So finally, I can get into some production. You've probably seen at mevio.com every single

1022
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:40,980
day. There's a new, uh, uh, new little, uh, these days. It's like three minutes, three, four minutes,

1023
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:46,260
highlighting stuff that's new on the across our four networks for that day. So that's,

1024
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:51,300
men, women, music, and tech. You can play those channels. They, they roll out one after another.

1025
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:56,500
It's, um, you know, it is literally in one of our channel systems. So one, one show play one at one

1026
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:01,380
episode plays after another. I'm very happy with it. Advertisers are happy with it. And it's looking

1027
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:07,540
cool. And it's just given me so many ideas of things I want to do. I'm thinking of two shows

1028
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:14,020
that I want to put together. One is tentatively titled My Gear, the other one. They work for us.

1029
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:18,340
That's the tentative title of the show. And so it's that kind of stuff that I'm working on. What

1030
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:24,660
better way to start your day than with a hot cup of coffee with financial times? A little DSC.

1031
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:29,220
Well, you might want to go to the bathroom first. Here's Adam Curry.

1032
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:39,220
The part of the plan that is to get all of our information control us, give us ID cards,

1033
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:43,300
keep us as hot little fucking slaves. Keep working, keep paying your taxes.

1034
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:50,420
And present electobama is just as bad when it comes to that. Because we're going to have one

1035
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:59,700
million soldiers working to secure the homeland. One million soldiers and already they have

1036
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:06,100
five battalions just in case there's any unrest during the credit crisis. And all they're doing

1037
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:11,300
now is keeping the shit afloat until Obama is president. The minute he's president and he knows

1038
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:16,340
it's coming. He's part of the plan. That's when it ruled. That's when the wheels come off this thing.

1039
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:22,180
I'm talking global meltdown. The minute, maybe a minute, maybe two minutes after he's

1040
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:25,860
president. Dog is still barking. You're going to bark yourself to death.

1041
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:33,860
And now the song that I've been waiting for to play for you for at least four years. I was unable

1042
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:39,380
to find it in the iTunes music store. Unable to find it anywhere online even at cpo.com,

1043
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:46,660
which is where I rip all the best stuff. Finally, I found out through a message on drop.io slash

1044
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:54,660
daily source code that it is available for sale at emusic.com. And of course, I'm signed up.

1045
01:17:54,660 --> 01:18:01,860
emusic.com slash daily source code. I got 35 free songs. This was one of them. The LSE brothers.

1046
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:16,180
I'd like to stay in love with you all summer and after fall I'll keep you on through the

1047
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:24,180
window. I've knitted one way. There's no more play.

1048
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:38,660
I'd like to write my heart should go with you on the end of the fall. You'll have to run away.

1049
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:45,780
Do all that chase it through the matter. Wish you all without a few more times.

1050
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,980
It's never covered.

1051
01:18:48,980 --> 01:19:18,980
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1052
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:48,980
no, no, no, no,

1053
01:19:48,980 --> 01:20:15,980
Oh yeah, I think it must have been the summer of 75. I was a wee boy, maybe 11, 12, maybe 13 years old,

1054
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:20,980
all the madly in love with a girl at school and just thinking about right with her and my handlebars

1055
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:23,980
through the middle and really didn't mean it.

1056
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:28,980
That's from the soundtrack to my lives, how to share with you on the source code.

1057
01:20:45,980 --> 01:21:03,980
Oh man, perfect way to finish off the week as if we're from our Friday maximum music

1058
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:08,980
free training spirit and the Alessi brothers of Lauren.

1059
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:15,980
You're Adam, you're my Eduardo, where are we going from Seattle?

1060
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:20,980
Yeah, long time listening to her first shine dropper and I wanted to drop you a message.

1061
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:24,980
By the way, that is now official Charlie vernacular.

1062
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,980
First time call or long time dropper.

1063
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,980
Just as long as you're dropping, that's good.

1064
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:33,980
Because during your past show, you keep complaining about hearing the dog

1065
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:38,980
and you play around with your nice kid and I couldn't tell the difference.

1066
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:42,980
I didn't hear your dog and I wasn't sure if you're just...

1067
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:44,980
I love the way you say that.

1068
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:46,980
I didn't hear your dog.

1069
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:48,980
I didn't hear your dog, man.

1070
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:50,980
I couldn't hear your dog.

1071
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:07,980
At least the stuff I will talk about with you guys.

1072
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:08,980
I got plenty of things.

1073
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:09,980
I'm so flushing out.

1074
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:12,980
There's a lot of improvement that I like to make in life.

1075
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:17,980
But the core of my existence, I'm just professionally with a person.

1076
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,980
Well, what is the data source code?

1077
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:23,980
Is the relationship that I have with you guys with Charlie heads out there?

1078
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:28,980
As it congealed and comes together on the source code drop.

1079
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:32,980
So here's the thinking that I have for this show and where I like to take it.

1080
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:36,980
I would like to commit a minimum of an hour, five days a week.

1081
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:40,980
If I started re-blocking the afternoon, you came time.

1082
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:44,980
Everyone has a possibility to check out life.

1083
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:47,980
But I really want to do it the right way.

1084
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:52,980
And I have a little better chance to really do something top of the whole day.

1085
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:53,980
Because we need to do...

1086
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:54,980
I can't know.

1087
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:59,980
I can no longer wait a day to talk about something because then it's five other things

1088
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:00,980
that it pile on top.

1089
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:04,980
And I'll just run now to what I've got for today.

1090
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:08,980
And this is all of the most that I've taken from the drop.

1091
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:10,980
Actually...

1092
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:13,980
Let me see.

1093
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:17,980
I see, actually.

1094
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:20,980
But I want to say, I don't know where to start.

1095
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:22,980
That's what I'm saying.

1096
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:24,980
So I'm gonna start sneaking stuff in, bit by bit.

1097
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:27,980
We've got to get to a larger, wider audience.

1098
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:28,980
Welcome in.

1099
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,980
Wake up, help understand what's going on.

1100
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:31,980
And tell a friend.

1101
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:33,980
He really needs to tell a friend.

1102
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:36,980
And my friends, that's it for this episode.

1103
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:38,980
So until we speak again, you got your freedom.

1104
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:39,980
Spread that.

1105
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:41,980
Let people know about it and let's maintain it.

1106
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,980
Let's keep that freedom.

1107
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:46,980
And above all, I don't know what you do about how you do it.

1108
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:48,980
Leave your life with passion.

1109
01:23:57,980 --> 01:23:59,980
Let's keep that freedom.

1110
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,980
Let's keep that freedom with passion.
