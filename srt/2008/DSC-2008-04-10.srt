7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
60 million dollars worth of airplane straps by ass.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Three minutes?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
To the next generation radio caught any of my ears.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We don't need no digging trees in.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I like to think I'm flying into this church.

17

I want to know how you feel.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There's ringing in my ear.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I know what to relate to.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Same to C.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Who can't believe it.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm eating on the floor.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There has to be a fault.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Who do I fall?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The stars around me shining.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But I'm not feeling vulnerable.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Follow up to you.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Show me the way.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Every day I want to.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Show me the way.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
My love, my love, my love, my love.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, my love, my love, my love, my love.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
When I get to know reason.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're living on your nerve.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
When someone drops the cup.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Then I answer first.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm swimming in the circle.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll feel I'm going out.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
They have to be a fault.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
To play in my heart.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But someone gonna be there.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But I'm not feeling vulnerable.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Follow up to you.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Show me the way.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Every day I want to.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Show me the way.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I want you.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Baby.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Baby.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I want you to find the dreamy

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll feel so unashamed

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I can't believe this is happening to me

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I want you when you sleep in

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And I want to take it

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I want you

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll make it the way

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Every day I want you

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll make it the way

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I want you

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I want you

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I want you

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I want you

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The organization for the preservation of the soundtrack of our lives

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
From the biggest selling line out of all time

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Peter Frampton

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Show me the way

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Kick it off

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Daily source code

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Difficult number

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
745

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Coming to you from the Curry Condo

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Overlooking the Bay Bridge right across from the 70's

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Story Tower of Death

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's a Thursday everybody

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Combining two days and once

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Because of the hectic travel schedule

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We'll kind of do half a food bar, half a catch up

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And some mustard and sour crowd on top

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Like that

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh man man man

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
How you guys doing?

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's been a couple days

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Nice fade out there

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
As I said here in the condo

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
A rife here Tuesday afternoon

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Went straight onto the office

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Did all the stuff that we needed to do

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Had some had a big meeting

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Tuesday afternoon

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
When I'm sorry

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Wednesday

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm confused man

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I am all over the map with the jet lag today

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh man

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And you know once again

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I go to bed

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I go to bed at 10 o'clock

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And ping my eyes open up

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's 545

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And I'm awake

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I can't even sleep any more than that

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I've been so messed up

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
With just

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I think it's a combination of

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The meeting schedules

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Between the UK and San Francisco

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The United States

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Shifting to daylight savings

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Time two weeks early

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If it's just difficult

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Doesn't it bother you as well?

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't just suck

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So a beautiful day here in San Francisco

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The sun is coming up

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's just about quarter to nine right now

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And I spent most of the morning

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Prepping for today's show

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What I'm not doing is streaming live

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Through live 365

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
For a number of reasons

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The first one being that

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I neglected to pick up a second monitor

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And I really can't do the show

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
With all the different things

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I've got running on one laptop screen

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And also be able to monitor the live 365 stream

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But there's other reasons of course

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So I do

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's like a go-mem

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Go-mem

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Live 365

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I've got a truck of shit

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's several people I've loads of trouble with it

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Then I've much fun with it myself

135
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Especially with you because you're here

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They're not going bucks for the pilot

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Wrap

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Um

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So it's better

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We do live them

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I've done some live stuff

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah, I know what you're going to

143
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I know you're going to recommend all kinds of stuff

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You know, I am quite disappointed

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But I think it's solvable

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And I think using live 365

147
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Four years

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Without much problem

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And I hadn't used it for about a year and a half

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
To be quite honest

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And reactivated my account

152
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And which indeed

153
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's 99 bucks a month

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But they also pay music royalty

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So I like that kind of deal

156
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Where I can actually play

157
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Licensed music

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And supposedly

159
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The artists get paid

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Or the record company

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
At least I'm sure get some piece of it

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So that part I liked

163
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Which I think is built into that 99 dollar fee

164
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So I'm digging that

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But

166
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Um

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
When you go to the website

168
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Even though this my station

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Adam C 1999 is on the air

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Often people will have to refresh

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Twenty times

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And even then it will still show that it's off air

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I tried handing out direct links

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
To the dot PLS file

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But that seems to expire after a while

176
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So if anyone has a way

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
For me just to just to get a link

178
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
A PLS file

179
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Or one link

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That will not expire

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
To live through 65

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I would love that

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Please help me out

184
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm really in deep trouble on this

185
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There of course

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Other ways to do it

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's just go and have to say about that

188
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Just read

189
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
From

190
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Uh

191
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000

FACTOR

194
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So it's kind of stuff

195
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Let's go

197

It never times

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You can spend some time in this thing

205
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You want on it

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And

207
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Um

208
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And it has no advertisement

209
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Some white bloody life 365

210
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay, I think it's fucking awesome

211
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah, I'm impressed

212
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's my thoughts

213
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh you think

214
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah, great

215
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No way

216
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Blah blah blah blah

217
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Blah blah blah

218
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah, it's pretty cool

219
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Scrunchers

220
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Alright man, thank you

221
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah, I don't like the ads either

222
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's also bugging me

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

224
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Gotta work on it

225
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Okay

226
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I promise when I get back home

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So

228
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
In

229
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't know, like

230
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Seven hours from now

231
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll be boarding a plane to New York

232
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I was supposed to go to New York last night

233
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But decided there was a couple things

234
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I could do here in San Francisco

235
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Well Ron is already off

236
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He took the red eye last night to New York

237
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So I got a couple meetings in New York

238
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And then Friday night

239
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I fly back to London

240
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So it's

241
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So I get half a red eye

242
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And then a full red eye

243
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh, I'm going to be

244
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh, wonderful at home

245
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
People will just love my attitude

246
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Speaking of which, I

247
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Boy, did I really mess this one up?

248
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I should have thought about this

249
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Adam, Dave from the Netherlands

250
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Dude, on last two baragician

251
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It told us you can drunk

252
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah, so this of course

253
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Was the evening out

254
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I had with Super Agent Keith

255
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The guys from two way traffic

256
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
At five Cavendish Square

257
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Where I was overserved on

258
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Italian wine

259
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Little, the notes to me

260
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It had a much higher alcohol content

261
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Than the wine that I've normally drunk

262
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
On an evening out

263
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And yeah, I got hammered.com

264
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now, what do you do when you get drunk?

265
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You call the DSC voicemail

266
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So I didn't give you

267
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Here to me finding

268
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Anyway, I'm calling to tell you

269
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Why I listened to the Charlie

270
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, it's

271
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I guess, being part of a tribe

272
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You know, same group of interest people

273
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You know, I'm concerned about environment

274
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And about the money is going on

275
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Our privacy

276
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And yeah, just get a sense of

277
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Belonging when he listened to the show

278
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So I got a suggestion

279
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Instead of that laying

280
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Great area

281
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yada, Yada, Yada

282
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And we should end with

283
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What kind of tribe you're into

284
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, I'm David

285
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And I'm into

286
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The DSC

287
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm into

288
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Music

289
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm into the tribe of

290
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Well, gaining a little bit apple

291
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And that's about it

292
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And of course, the tribe of Adam

293
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Take care

294
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm in

295
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Thank you

296
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Thank you very much

297
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't like the word

298
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Try

299
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I understand what you're saying

300
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But I also kind of like the great hair

301
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Hope you win

302
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I got it made that's kind of cool

303
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Hey, by the way

304
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Excuse me

305
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Did I call it

306
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
At the beginning of the week

307
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Well, maybe wasn't even last week

308
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
When I said that hey, the FAA

309
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We got to watch these guys

310
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Because they're letting

311
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Airlines get away with the low maintenance

312
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The hello

313
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
American Airlines heard the call

314
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Didn't they

315
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Boom

316
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What is it now?

317
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
1100 fights of flights cancelled

318
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And it's all over the news now

319
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And initially, I was even talking about

320
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
American Airlines

321
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I predict we're going to see a lot more of this

322
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
These maintenance

323
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Someone woke up and said

324
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Holy crap

325
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We're going to be in big trouble

326
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
If we don't have all of the airlines

327
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Up to date on their maintenance

328
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, duh

329
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Maintenance is everything

330
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So the two aircraft

331
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I will not get on

332
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Currently until

333
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm satisfied with

334
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Maintenance

335
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Directives, etc.

336
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Boeing triple seven

337
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We'll not fly it

338
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Because there's still something fishy

339
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Going on with their high pressure fuel pumps

340
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This, of course, is the same type of aircraft

341
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That landed short

342
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
At London's Heathrow Airport

343
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
British Airways

344
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And I guess MD 80's are out for now

345
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
For me, I mean, there's been a lot of these

346
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
No-swheel issues

347
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And you know what?

348
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Even though

349
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Turns out that the

350
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The issues aren't

351
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Well, it's kind of crazy

352
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Right?

353
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The nose wheel might not retract

354
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But, you know, the plane still flies

355
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And nose wheel works

356
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, it's a pilot

357
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You just don't want that shit

358
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You know, that stuff you can't see

359
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You really don't want something

360
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
With your landing gear

361
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's just not, it's not fun

362
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
At all

363
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Once I hear sirens outside

364
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I guess they're coming to give me already

365
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Hey, yesterday

366
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Speaking of sirens

367
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Man, this was out of control

368
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So the Olympic torch

369
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's like I beat the torch

370
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The flame

371
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
To San Francisco

372
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Of course, it was in London

373
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We had all kinds of skirmishes

374
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
People trying to extinguish the flame

375
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Then in France

376
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
They actually doused the flame

377
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And actually I thought

378
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It was kind of like, you know, the American flag

379
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Where if it's flag touches the ground

380
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You have to burn it

381
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I thought if the Olympic flame goes out

382
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Don't they have to go back to Greece

383
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And get it re-lit?

384
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Apparently not

385
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Apparently they have like, they carry the flame

386
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
In a backup case

387
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And it's always lit

388
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And they can relight

389
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But yesterday the flame

390
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Decended upon San Francisco

391
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And of course there were all kinds of skirmishes

392
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And krefuffles

393
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And right outside our office

394
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
In fact, it was crazy

395
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Because it wasn't just the

396
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Pro-Tibet protesters

397
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And anti-China protesters

398
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But they were pro-China protesters

399
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And they were converging on the street

400
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Right here on Second Street

401
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yet people with Chinese flags

402
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And they were yelling at each other

403
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And it was like, oh my god

404
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It was absolutely surreal

405
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
To see this

406
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And where did all these Chinese

407
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But supporters come from

408
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Just a start

409
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I saw a couple of them walking around with maps

410
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It had to be organized

411
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't think they actually

412
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They may not even live here

413
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't know

414
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But it was wow

415
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This was just amazing to me

416
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The amount of vocal outrage

417
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And of course I come right back to

418
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Man, what the hell is going on

419
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
How come we're so loud

420
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And so vocal about

421
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
About, you know,

422
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Props to Tibet

423
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And I understand there's issues

424
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And it's been that way

425
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
For more than just this upcoming Olympics

426
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The suppression of Tibet

427
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And other countries like Taiwan

428
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
By China

429
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Has been going on for many many years

430
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But look at all the crap that's going on

431
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
At home that we're not yelling about

432
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Why?

433
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It boggles my mind

434
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I love that outrage

435
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I love the emotion

436
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I love the passion

437
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But please, can't we be passionate about

438
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
A couple other things

439
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Like the war

440
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
We need bigger protests and demonstrations

441
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
How about just simple things

442
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Like our idiot kids

443
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Who have no decent education

444
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Holy crap

445
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That's just freaking me out

446
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Hey Adam, Billy, I'm here

447
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Lost Queen is Texas USA

448
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And just actually getting caught up right now

449
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And I'm listening to 744

450
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Of the Charlie

451
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And you said something that piss me off

452
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But not a you at all

453
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's one of those things that just kind of

454
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Every time it comes up it just gets to me

455
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You were talking about the

456
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The new writing in the UK

457
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And how

458
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
People are so willing to

459
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You know, say something when it doesn't affect them

460
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But they have absolutely no willingness

461
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
to say anything when

462
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You know, when they're

463
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
When they're the oppressed majority

464
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And

465
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I think that's really been going on for

466
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
As long as I'm 25

467
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's been going on for as long as I've been alive

468
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
In the States

469
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh son, let me tell you

470
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm 43

471
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Hell yes has been going on forever

472
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's for some reason as human nature

473
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I just don't understand it

474
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
We're so concerned about

475
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Other people in other countries

476
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Absolutely important

477
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But

478
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And we got some

479
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Who's who's writing for us

480
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Who's writing for what's going on with our economy

481
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Who's writing for that?

482
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Nobody

483
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Particularly in education

484
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I mean we have

485
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Probably the highest turnout of

486
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
People who graduate high school

487
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And you know can't read

488
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Or have so very little desire to do so

489
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That they cannot move on in life

490
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And everyone finds this completely

491
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's very obvious it's well-known

492
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There's no dialogue about it at all

493
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I mean it's

494
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's one of these things

495
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You know just like the

496
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Just like the vague racism

497
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
As people keep calling it

498
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's going on behind closed doors

499
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's not at all racism

500
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's just one of those things

501
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It comes up in private

502
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And it's completely pointless

503
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Anyways

504
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Love you

505
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I mean it's great here

506
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Hope you win

507
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And let's make a change

508
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Man

509
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Thank you

510
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Well of course the dialogue is here on the Charlie

511
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So I appreciate that

512
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Let me just say something about China

513
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And about boycotting it

514
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If you want to boycott

515
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Okay

516
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Boycott the freaking Olympics

517
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
All right

518
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Now I've dealt with the local Olympic committees

519
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I've had some exposure to the international Olympic committee

520
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The IOC you see it written everywhere now

521
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
These guys are evil

522
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Okay

523
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It has nothing to do with sports

524
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It has nothing to do with

525
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
With a political agenda

526
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It is all about money

527
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
This is one huge money making machine

528
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
If you truly want to

529
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Support to bet

530
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Okay

531
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If you want to protest China

532
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Do not watch the Olympics

533
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Do not watch any of that coverage

534
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Which by the way

535
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The rights to that is over a billion

536
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Dollars

537
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay

538
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Just the rights to broadcast it

539
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Athletes are forbidden

540
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
From posting pictures or video

541
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Of any kind on their personal web

542
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Logs while they're there

543
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They're allowed to write

544
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But they're not allowed to post any media files

545
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Because that's all part of the rights

546
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And it's ludicrous

547
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's absolutely

548
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
A stounding that we're still falling for this scam

549
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Hey another if you want to boycott China

550
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Hey

551
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If you're listening to the show on an iPod right now

552
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Okay

553
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
In fact I'm going to look

554
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm going to look at my

555
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Um

556
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
In my old iPod here

557
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yes indeed

558
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Check this out

559
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Flip it over

560
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Okay

561
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Now be careful if you're driving

562
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But right there

563
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And have my iPod here

564
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This is an iPod touch 16 gigabyte

565
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
On the back casing

566
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's really it's tiny letters

567
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And with my old age eyesight

568
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I actually have to

569
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Bring it really close to my eyes

570
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And I have to take my specs off

571
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Designed by Apple in California

572
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Assembled in China

573
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So instead of being all messed up

574
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
About you know the Olympics

575
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Stop buying iPods

576
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Stop buying shit from China

577
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What is it?

578
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
75% of everything in the United States

579
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Is manufactured in China

580
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
If you really truly want to protest

581
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Stop buying that crap

582
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Stop it

583
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You can't

584
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
We're addicted to crap

585
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm addicted to crap

586
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay

587
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I got a backslash on that

588
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's really

589
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh man that gets me all riled up

590
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh this was interesting

591
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
We knew this was going to happen

592
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It seems like for some reason

593
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
In a stoke

594
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Some weird stuff happens in the UK

595
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
If you hadn't picked up on this story

596
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
A BBC radio reporter

597
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Was held to the ground

598
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And searched by police

599
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Under the Terrorism Act

600
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
After his transmitter equipment

601
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Was mistaken for a bomb

602
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
This is Max Khan

603
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Was forced to his knees

604
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And there's a picture of his backpack

605
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Here which is like

606
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
If he was truly

607
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Suicide bomber

608
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
He would have failed the exam

609
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Because it's not it's pretty obvious

610
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That he's got all

611
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's got antennas

612
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
They can out

613
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
He's got headphones on

614
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And this is in stoke

615
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's the second time this happened

616
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Earlier this year

617
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Police tackled a guy in the stoke

618
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
After they thought his MP3 player was a gun

619
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm all for preventive

620
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
For prevention

621
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But it's getting a little bit crazy

622
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Of course it was phoned in by someone who said

623
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh there's a terrorist

624
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
By the way

625
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I believe Max looks a little bit ethnic

626
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So I don't know

627
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't know if anything to do

628
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Had anything to do with it whatsoever

629
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But it's just nuts

630
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm definitely going to mess with your head

631
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
In a little bit

632
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I've got something fantastic

633
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
We're going to play with your brain

This is going to blow your mind

637
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
When we do this a little

638
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
A little brain experiment

639
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Stay tuned

640
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000

I have been

646
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Not around the music business for a while

647
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I've worked inside touring music

648
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
With Ray Charles

649
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Wow

650
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Did a tour with Barry Madeline

651
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Wow

We've been doing pretty well in the CMJ radio charts

658
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And the tune that seems to be getting the most

659
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Airplay is Australia

660
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Really

661
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
A number of people have come up to me

662
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And I said, why are you thinking

663
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You know, it's my record

664
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You know, no one can stop me

665
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Which maybe you can stop me

669
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh yeah

670
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You know I will

671
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah, I've been using that drop.io

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Slash Daily source code thing

673
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And I'm getting all kinds of interesting files

674
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I've never heard of this guy's name is David Garza

675
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But whenever you've got a

676
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
A song titled that includes the word

677
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
TrueBador I'm in baby

678
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Such a beautiful French word

679
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
TrueBador

680
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
In fact, this is the Il TrueBador

681
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
If a Garza in the Charlie episode

682
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
7-4-5

683
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Oh

684
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Time to sweep the underground

685
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh

686
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Time to sweep the town

688
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Oh

689
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Time to roll the windows down

690
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Because we're so velvety

691
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh

692
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
For better pass than they throw

693
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Let's miss a little of these pieces

694
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
No

695
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Let me jump

696
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I like rub it up faster

697
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Baby lives

699
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Oh

700
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I just ride

701
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And keep jumping on the highway

702
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And glide

703
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Could have met all the bells

704
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And hold it up slow

705
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh

706
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm a less lame pass

707
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And while I'm putting a stop

708
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And yeah

709
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
With the chill cast

I'm going to make quick

712
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
No, you all had a long day

713
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Oh

714
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Time to sweep the town

715
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Oh

716
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Time to roll the windows down

717
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Because we're so velvety

718
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Oh

719
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Time to sweep the town

720
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Oh

721
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Time to sweep the town

722
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm a strange mess of man

723
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
When I hit the stand

724
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And the whesses of the black and hand

725
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm the sage of rage

726
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
When I smack the stage

727
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Like some guilt you would don't want to be

728
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Oh

729
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I got a feeling of no mistakes

730
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I don't know when the ghosts are okay

731
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah

732
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah

733
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yeah

734
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh

735
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What if I slip it

736
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I drop these with a lace ass trippin

737
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Tap trees with CDs

738
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000

Sip them up and sit there

769
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh

770
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Oh

771
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Oh

772
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Oh

773
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Oh

774
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Oh

775
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh

776
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Oh

777
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
David Garza

778
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It's a true bad duer

779
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
True bad duer

780
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
My damn an issue

781
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I should play some more friends music for you

782
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I was thinking actually

783
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I get back Saturday

784
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Depending on what time I get in depending on feeling

785
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I may

786
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Or maybe even Sunday I just might do a full music show

787
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I really feel like playing this

788
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm cool jams for you

789
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And that of course I will put on live 365

790
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So we can enjoy it all together

791
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That's part of the tribe

792
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It's funny

793
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Well that song was playing

794
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm here in the condo

795
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And I have my first gen iPod

796
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Which is

797
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Is that the first gen 30 gigabyte

798
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's funny when you hold this thing in your hands

799
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It's like wow

800
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It feels like a brick compared to the new iPods

801
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And I was looking at the back

802
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You know thinking

803
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Just let me continue my

804
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You might rant here about

805
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Protesting a Chinese

806
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Stop buying the shit man in China

807
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Which by the way

808
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
A lot of it is shit

809
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Okay

810
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
A lot of it contains dangerous chemicals

811
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And it's just shit

812
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Although I love my new iPod touch

813
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Here check this out

814
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Designed by Apple and California

815
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
A symbol in Taiwan

816
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
How interesting is that

817
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So they were manufacturing these things in Taiwan

818
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
First which of course

819
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
The country which has been suppressed by China for many many years

820
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And then they switched to

821
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And they switched to a assembly in China

822
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Interesting

823
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Why don't you go boycott Apple

824
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Or you just love your Apple products too much

825
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Ah

826
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
In consistencies my friend

827
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It just drives me nuts

828
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Let me see

829
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
When I also have here in my much

830
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Oh yes, this is a very important

831
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Then we had a

832
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
A new

833
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Monetary scientist

834
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
A lot of the charlie

835
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And this of course is a trace mayor

836
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And he operates

837
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
RunToGold.com

838
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And I had a whole bunch of questions

839
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Last time he called him we talked about on the show

840
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And he's answered them

841
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
He's put up a page which of course

842
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I'll put a link in the show

843
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
No it's a daily source code.com

844
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And he's answered a lot of the questions

845
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
That I posed

846
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And I think there's some really good answers

847
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So you want to check out RunToGold.com

848
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
R-U-N-T-O-G-O-L-D.com

849
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Link in the show

850
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
No it's a daily source code.com

851
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
All right

852
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Ready to have your mind blown

853
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
This is an audio file

854
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
That I've heard things similar to this

855
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But I've never heard this one

856
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Sent me when I got my girlfriend

857
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Kacha in the Netherlands

858
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I've worked with on many different projects

859
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Video audio

860
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Or like

861
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And it's funny because she sent this to me

862
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And email said

863
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Listen to this with your headphones on

864
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And that was the subject line of the email

865
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm like

866
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Oh man, you know it's going to be something really dirty

867
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It wasn't but it was equally exciting

868
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
This is the virtual barbershop

869
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So I want you to listen to this

870
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Now it really works best if you have headphones on

871
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It'll work if you have ear buds in

872
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But what I want you to do is I really want you to plug them into your ear

873
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Like jam them in a little bit deep

874
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's about four minutes

875
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But it'll be well worth it

876
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
In order to get the full effect

877
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Because through the

878
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
The Magic of Stereo

879
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Which is not all that magical

880
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But really what your brain is going to be doing

881
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Your brain is going to position sound

882
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
In a virtual space

883
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Around your head

884
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
That's why it's best with headphones

885
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I think it probably would work in the car as well

886
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
If you have they if you turn it really loud

887
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And close your eyes

888
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Which of course is not a really good idea in the car

889
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm just saying

890
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Enjoy this as we

891
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And I mean all of us together

892
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Charlie heads hand in hand

893
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Have a virtual haircut

894
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
At the virtual barber shop

895
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Enjoy

896
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Oh

897
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Oh

898
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Hello there hello there how are you yes yes

899
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You are here for the virtual haircut

900
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yes it's okay

901
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I will go get the Ouija you will come and cut your hair

902
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I mean well just stay right there

903
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Oh

904
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Ouija

905
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Hello Ouija

906
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Hello Ouija

907
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's my ladder

908
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
The person is here for the virtual haircut

909
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You better come on

910
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
What?

911
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Come running out

912
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
He is coming up right now

913
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I mean when I will go over here

914
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And play the music

915
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Then the guitar

916
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Because that is what I do here at the barber shop

917
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It's so nice to see you

918
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Welcome to the Starky Settera barber shop

919
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And your virtual haircut

920
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'd like to start the demonstration

921
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
By moving over to your right hand side

922
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And I'm making up this bag

923
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It can just hold still for a second

924
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I'll put this bag over your hair

925
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Just like that

926
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
The bag over the top of the head

927
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And now I'll take the bag off

928
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
There we go

929
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The only reason I did that is because

930
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
All of the fancy barber shops do that

931
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
What you're listening to is I move off to your right side

932
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Very quickly wash my hands

933
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Then well

934
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
If you get that please

935
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I will make it my way

936
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Let me finish washing my hands

937
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Just thought they were waiting for us

938
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
There we go

939
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Oh yes

940
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
As always the same

941
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
All we are doing is using your head

942
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
As the listening point

943
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
No

944
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And we have two microphones

945
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
One on either side of the head

946
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
In the same position

947
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Is where you're left

948
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And you're right

949
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
The ears are

950
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Your brain is doing all of the work

951
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Telling you where the sounds are coming from

952
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Okay

953
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I'll go get the scissors

954
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Now is the beginning clipping

955
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And I bring the clippers closer to your ear

956
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Very close to the right ear

957
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
All the means I move around the back of the head

958
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
To the left ear

959
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And up

960
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And over the top of the head

961
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Okay

962
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Oh

963
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You can get the same effect

964
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
The better with the electric razor

965
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
All the first ring it's close to your right ear

966
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And around the back

967
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And onto your neck

968
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yeah

969
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I think that looks wonderful

970
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Manuel, what do you think?

971
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
But yes

972
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It looks wonderful Luigi

973
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You do such nice work

974
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Oh thank you so much Manuel

975
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So fast too

976
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Now

977
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
As I walk around

978
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I just want to tell you once more

979
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
The durability to hear where I am

980
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
As I walk around the room

981
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Is simply the amazing power of your brain

982
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Calculating the tiny differences

983
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Work use in sound intensity

984
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And arrival time from two open ears

985
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And unlike any other hearing instrument

986
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Only one has the digital algorithm

987
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
That negates its own physical presence

988
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
In the ear to fully restore those differences

989
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
That algorithm is called

990
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Set there on

991
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Well thank you

992
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Thank you so much for stopping by

993
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's starting virtual barbershop

994
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Goodbye

995
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Have a great day

996
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I did it work for you

997
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It worked once again for me

998
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I really enjoyed that

999
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Although I think the limited compressor limit

1000
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I have room was a little bit of the effect

1001
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
But oh man

1002
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Love that

1003
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You want to all probably upload that

1004
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
File to the drop.io slash daily source code

1005
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Which you should check out from time to time

1006
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Because it's amazing stuff

1007
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
People are putting up there

1008
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Not that I use everything in the show

1009
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
But it's just amazing

1010
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
The things that people are uploading

1011
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And posting and links

1012
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And really really like that system

1013
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Congratulations

1014
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
By the way

1015
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
To the ladies over at lip gloss

1016
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And laptops celebrating their 100th episode

1017
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I've been listening to them following them for a couple of years

1018
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Always love the whole concept

1019
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I love the title of the show right off

1020
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
The bad lip gloss and laptops.com

1021
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Definitely go check them out

1022
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So

1023
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I just got word that I'll be leaving

1024
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Town to PM

1025
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I think I'm going to be playing out of San Jose

1026
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's hard to get a flight that gets you in

1027
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Any decent time in New York unless you want to take the red eye

1028
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So I actually got to move shit along here

1029
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Now because we're doing a combined football Friday

1030
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Really

1031
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I mean only because I just won't be able to actually physically do anything on Friday

1032
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Again, that's why I'm going to hook you up on the weekend

1033
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
There is of course one thing that comes with every single football Friday show

1034
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And your week just isn't complete without it

1035
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And well, y'all that is best so we might as well get down to the hit test

1036
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Number 117

1037
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Fantastic

1038
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Hey Adam, it's time for another hit test

1039
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And this one is themed

1040
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I hope you'll figure it out

1041
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Here we go with intro

1042
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Oh, it's not I thought it was Eric Clapton though

1043
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's a BG's nice on Broadway

1044
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Number two

1045
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I got the theme

1046
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I got you

1047
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
On Broadway George Benson

1048
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Is this a Broadway theme by any chance?

1049
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
What other Broadway song could y'all have in store for us?

1050
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Number three

1051
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Okay

1052
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Well, I thought it was a Broadway theme

1053
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
That would be

1054
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I don't know

1055
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I give up

1056
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Time's up and here we go with the answers

1057
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Give me the hit test

1058
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And so number one is from 1975

1059
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
He's got the BG

1060
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Hell yeah

1061
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It's a little bit set up

1062
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm a night song from

1063
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Singin' at the sun

1064
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Singin' at me

1065
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Baby

1066
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Night song Broadway by the BG's

1067
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
As answer number one

1068
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Yeah

1069
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
This is answer number two

1070
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Got that one right

1071
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
This is your adventure

1072
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So what's number three then, you know?

1073
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
On Broadway by George Benson

1074
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The answer number two

1075
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Number three

1076
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And this is answer number three

1077
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Hellbow bone

1078
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Send the record to yours

1079
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
He's got me

1080
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
He's got me

1081
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Oh yeah, I recognize this now

1082
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
What's the final song?

1083
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Broadway

1084
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Take me for a night

1085
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
New York

1086
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Oh, I got it

1087
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
To New York

1088
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Answer number three

1089
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Hellbow bone

1090
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Send the record to yours

1091
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
From 1984

1092
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Take me for a night

1093
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
In New York

1094
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
In this New York theme hit test

1095
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And it's number 117

1096
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So how did you do Edmund?

1097
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Well, you kind of messed me up with the two Broadway songs

1098
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I wouldn't have known Hellbow bones in the record

1099
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Here's two out of three

1100
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
For us to this hit test

1101
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And also the iTunes links

1102
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So you can buy these tracks online

1103
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Or to be found at hittest.barsho.com

1104
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Thank you for playing Edmund

1105
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Have a nice trip home

1106
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Everyone else, thank you for listening

1107
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Next week I'll be back for the next hit test

1108
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So stay tuned

1109
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Have a very nice week

1110
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And remember try to think with your heart

1111
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Bye bye

1112
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Johnny Boy

1113
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Fantastic

1114
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I like that thing with your heart

1115
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That's his sign-off now

1116
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Very cool

1117
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Okay, so we're just about

1118
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Just about there with the show

1119
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I think I got to

1120
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Let me see one or two more things to do here

1121
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And so we'll have a no agenda

1122
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Which we'll do on Saturday

1123
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
As I said, I'm thinking about doing a maximum music

1124
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Football or freight train over the weekend

1125
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Actually Patricia and Christina

1126
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
We'll be in there on the road

1127
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Patricia is doing

1128
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Another day of taping for Holland's Got Talent

1129
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And I believe my daughter has an audition for a movie

1130
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yeah, we're in show business mode, everybody

1131
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Adam, there's just a comment on the smile

1132
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And this isn't the 744

1133
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Do you want to know why people listen to the show?

1134
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Yeah, the reason I listen to the show

1135
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Is because I've been listening

1136
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Since you moved to the college

1137
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Which is a good few years now

1138
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I'm 23

1139
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So the reason I listen to podcasts

1140
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Just have a specialist

1141
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Because you are the same track to my life

1142
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Or at least a good percentage of us

1143
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So that's me

1144
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Oh man, I really appreciate that

1145
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
That's so nice of you to say

1146
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Well, let me add another entry to the soundtrack of your life

1147
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
This is brand new on the Podsave Music Network

1148
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Fuck Cherry

1149
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Oh man, I miss you

1150
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And things was the same

1151
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Because everything is time

1152
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And now what comes out of

1153
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And when I see you cry

1154
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It makes me want to die

1155
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I'll tell you about

1156
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'll tell you about

1157
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I'll tell you about all the things

1158
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I said to you, I don't know

1159
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I can't say goodbye

1160
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I love how you kiss

1161
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I love all your sounds

1162
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Maybe the way you make my world

1163
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Go round and adjust

1164
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
What is the same

1165
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I'm sorry

1166
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Let's start

1167
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I think I'm too blame

1168
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's harder to get through the days

1169
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
We get all the blame

1170
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Turns the shame

1171
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Because everything is time

1172
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And now what comes out of

1173
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And when I see you cry

1174
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It makes me want to die

1175
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I'll tell you about

1176
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I'll tell you about

1177
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I'll tell you about all the things

1178
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I said to you, I don't know

1179
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I can't say goodbye

1180
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I love how you kiss

1181
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I love all your sounds

1182
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Maybe the way you make my world

1183
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Go round and adjust

1184
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
What is the same

1185
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm sorry

1186
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Every single day

1187
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I think about how we came all this way

1188
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
The sleepless nights

1189
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And the tears you cried

1190
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's harder to get through the days

1191
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
We get all the blame

1192
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
All the blame

1193
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm sorry I'm bad

1194
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm sorry I'm bad

1195
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I'm sorry about all the things

1196
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I said to you, I don't know

1197
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I can't say goodbye

1198
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I love how you kiss

1199
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I love all your sounds

1200
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Maybe the way you make my world

1201
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Go round and adjust

1202
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
What is the same

1203
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I'm sorry

1204
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Oh man

1205
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
There's sold over a million albums

1206
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
They're probably the biggest rock band in the United States today

1207
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Fuck Cherry

1208
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Now on the pod save music network

1209
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
With a track sorry

1210
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
See these guys, they get it

1211
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Man, that's right

1212
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Put it out there

1213
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You'll sell more, you'll have more people going to concerts

1214
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
More merchandise

1215
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Oh yeah

1216
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Love it

1217
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Links in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

1218
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Fantastic

1219
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Ah

1220
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Okay

1221
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I'm tired

1222
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm spent

1223
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I gotta get my ass in gear

1224
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I'm still actually here in my bathroom

1225
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
In the condo

1226
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So apologies for the parents

1227
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Usually I try to do a little bit better for you guys

1228
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Okay

1229
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
So as I said no show tomorrow

1230
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Unless of course you're living down under

1231
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Australia, which means we'll be a show tomorrow

1232
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Because it's actually Friday

1233
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
In fact, you're probably working on Saturdays

1234
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
We speak

1235
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And

1236
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Well

1237
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Be good

1238
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000

And while you still can

1246
