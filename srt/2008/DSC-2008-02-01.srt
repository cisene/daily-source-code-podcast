The most crazy night, a full moon in the city

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
She wants to be reds the best way that's back underneath

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
She wants a passion, needs that for me, yes, no, no

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
She blew me into the Senate, she blew me away

00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,180
wrapping up the week here in San Francisco

45
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,700
and the Russians are definitely checking in on

46
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,460
as my friends, listen to this.

47
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:15,100
Bravo, Bravo, Edno, V, 3, Bravo, Bravo, Edno, V, 3,

49
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,540
Now I don't know, man.

50
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,460
I don't know, Probo, Probo, sound, it could be Italian,

51
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,420
but this is pretend it's Russian, okay?

52
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,220
Ha ha ha.

53
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,900
Oh man, wrapping up a week,

54
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,620
I've got a whole bunch of cool music lined up for you.

55
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,420
I think we got six songs ready for today,

56
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,420
five or six, got a hit test,

57
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,660
got some other sub-on stuff in buy,

58
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,020
like my pal Amy Mack,

59
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,180
who has been evaluating my ass throughout the week,

60
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,740
well, I've been in San Francisco.

61
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,020
And of course, while I'm here,

62
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,260
people are passing through G-town.

63
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,860
Hello Adam, my name is Joseph Carradis.

64
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,900
I've been living pure podcast for quite a while now.

65
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,500
And about this my first time that I'm calling,

66
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,180
I was just rushing through G-town

67
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,500
and I said, like, well, the hit,

68
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,140
let's say, let's call and say hello to Adam.

69
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,180
I love you, they're normal, right?

70
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,900
Back at you, my friend.

71
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,380
Too bad, too bad you were a passenger G-town

72
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,940
and it wasn't there to meet you.

73
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,580
And of course, you know,

74
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,340
it's not a live phone that rings anywhere.

75
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,780
So call me an advanced next time,

76
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,580
man, we'll hook up with the Starbucks.

77
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,620
Hi Adam, Eric's important to me.

78
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,220
I've been trying to get my wife interested in podcasts

79
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,860
for the past two years without any luck.

80
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,140
Well, last night she was feeling kind of down

81
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:39,140
and I walked to her computer and downloaded DSC 716.

82
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,900
I'm in it later, we were listening to natives

83
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,220
of the new dawn, this day.

84
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,380
The mood changed instantly.

85
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,620
And then her young kids came in

86
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,100
and we cranked up party like a rock star.

87
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,420
We were all danced around with Dan

88
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,340
like a bunch of lunatics.

89
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,860
It was a great time.

90
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,220
And I think you have a new listener.

91
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,220
Love you, bro.

92
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,060
Go home.

93
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,900
No, man, love you back.

94
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,700
No, homo, you know what it's like, right?

95
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,900
Uh, see, I had a, uh, someone sending a question

96
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,900
about that.

97
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,780
It must be somewhere, uh, hmm.

98
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,300
Maybe it was this.

99
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,700
Hey, Adam, how are you?

100
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,340
It's probably for my first.

101
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,460
How what's going to your back?

102
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,300
You if they're saying no homo means that you're not homo.

103
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:50,300
It's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo

104
00:07:50,300 --> 00:08:20,300
it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo, it's not homo

105
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,300
Trim up, put down the seeds

106
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,300
I shed the light on the brand

107
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,300
The day I stretched my own to give a sigh

108
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,300
I watched the grass fight out of my eyes

109
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,300
I hit out, down all the town

110
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,300
No shame at jamming up the ground

111
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,300
Rolled on, just to the shore

112
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,300
All these girls ain't knocking on my doors

113
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,300
The worries won't against time

114
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,300
But I still didn't even tell the night

115
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,300
I get so tired to say

116
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
Get the same old shit, just a

117
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
Driven day, let the boogie loose

118
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,300
And let the boogie loose

119
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Let the boogie loose today

120
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,300
Did any old layers of weight

121
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,300
And let the boogie loose tonight

122
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,300
And let the time even feel it all right

123

Feel it all right, yeah

124
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,300
It's not a one of those tracks just makes me feel good

125
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,300
Dancing around like idiots in the middle of the night

126
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,300
The brain buckets

127
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,300
And let the boogie loose tonight

128
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,300

Someone

Challenging this past week audio wise

I've been working on Ableton Live

It's been anything but easy you know

163
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,300
We go back to your via

164
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,300
You've got about on a Mac and on

165
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,300
Yeah

166
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:34,540
Thank you for the comment. I took that into account and specifically beefed up the microphone and I think we're doing a little bit better there

167
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:40,820
Brain bucket that the movie loose from the pod save music network at music.podshow.com

168
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:52,180
Hey Adam how are you? It's Pablo from headquarters. I was going to ask you is there saying no homo means that you are not homo or you are not short

169
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,180
And if you say you are not short or you know what you are

170
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,180
Okay, if I hold that

171
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,180
You can understand that question. Love you. Love you mean it

172
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,180
No, man. It's I picked that up from

173
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,180
From Tony over at costas world

174
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:16,180
He and the boys would sit around and they had this one long conversation one day about

175
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:22,180
About about guys who hug each other and say hey man, I love you and then they say no homo, which is

176
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:34,180
It's only in America. Do you need to say that really? I mean I I don't think you need to say that anywhere else, but it's just because actually we have yet for someone to call in to say I love you a homo

177
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,180
Which is fine, too. So to answer your question

178
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,180
It's just a way of

179
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,180
Mainly American males feeling more comfortable about saying I love you

180
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:53,180
Any kind of playing it off. You know how guys when they hug they like hit each other on the bat that pay attention to that when when males hug

181
00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:00,180
Particularly straight males. They'll pat each other. You know sloppy child on the back that often there is no embrace. There is no

182
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,180
There's no warmth and no love transferring. Which is a shame, really

183
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,180
Of course, to answer your question. Honestly, I don't know

184
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,180
God

185
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:19,180
Hey entertainment of the week. Thank you very much. This is one of those links that a million people actually did send to me

186
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:27,180
And I appreciate every single one and it really turned into just my favorite past time over the past

187
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,180
Over the past two days, apologies, of course, we're not bringing you a show yesterday

188
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,180
I'm not even going to tell you what it is. Just listen to the comment. It's it's fairly obvious and it's wonderful really is

189
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,180
Yeah, I'm this is Scott from Sonny, South Bend, Indiana

190
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,180
First time one time

191
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,180
Right now

192
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,180
Hey, I was listening to you for quite some time and

193
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,180
Just thinking about all the travels you've been having with the TSA and getting stopped in airports

194
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,180
This evening on the 31st is a lot of stuff on around the net

195
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,180
Let me just stop you there for one second

196
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:05,180
Even though I appreciate the thought about TSA, it is not actually the TSA that are giving me

197
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:12,180
Well, it's not even a problem now. Now it's just become a joke. It's the CBP Customs Border Protection Agency

198
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,180
Still part of Homeland Security

199
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,180
We're pretty much identical uniforms although these guys

200
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,180
They're packing heat

201
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,180
The customs guys they got weapons TSA

202
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,180
Thank god almighty. They got no no led to shoot it.

203
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,180
TSA actually having a blog of all things. It's at tsa.gov slash blog

204
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,180
And if you look at it, it's actually pretty funny

205
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,180
So whoever wrote it or put the page together actually has a sense of humor

206
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,180
On the net. A whole lot of posts and responses on it

207
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,180
And you can't look at it. It's hilarious

208
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,180
The people that are running it, writing it and reading to the comments

209
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,180
Some of the TSA are actually acting like human beings

210
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,180
Kind of interesting. Like to see what you think about it

211
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:06,180
Yeah man, thanks. As I said, total amusement, total entertainment, love every single second of it

212
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,180
Not gonna post it. In fact, I shouldn't even I should be reading it through a proxy server

213
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,180
But the idea is good TSA.gov slash blog

214
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,180
And I am not alone. We are not alone my friends. That's for sure

215
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,180
What I haven't really seen yet though is some really good responses

216
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,180
They're starting to clean it up. They did kind of a classic mistake

217
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,180
Well, I just the whole idea of using WordPress comments

218
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,180
For a weblog, for an agency of

219
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,180
That has hated this much actually

220
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,180
It's just a mistake in the thinking process

221
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,180
So that's gonna tell me that this is a pretty genuine effort

222
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,180
It feels like at least

223
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,180
So they're gonna have to do a lot of cleanup on the comments

224
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,180
And of course, you really should be doing a forum when you think about it

225
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:58,180
But fun initiative, still, still not loving the TSA

226
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,180
Even though you're showing a little bit more for human face, it just doesn't cover

227
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,180
Hey, speaking of human faces, I happen to be wearing my hands

228
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,180
Are my shoulders

229
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,180
Hey Amy, bring it to me, let's do some exercise

230
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,180
Hey Adam, Amy, man

231
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,180
Okay, so I've seen you running around the office all week

232
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,180
And yet we haven't had time for a proper butt squeeze and evaluation

233
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,180
Yes correct

234
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,180
What happened to us?

235
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,180
Where are our priorities I ask you?

236
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,180
Okay, so maybe some things are more important than having a great ass

237
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,180
Well, but I don't know what that would be

238
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,180
Anyway, today we're gonna be standing, so do you gotta do

239
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,180
I'm gonna take the mic with me, okay, I'm standing

240
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,180
We're doing reverse lunges

241
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,180
So place your right foot in front of you and then put the left leg behind you

242
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,180
Left leg behind

243
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,180
You're gonna put it in a deep lunge

244
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,180
Then bend the back of the leg and take the knee almost to the floor

245
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,180
Keep that upper body up tall and straight

246
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,180
And then bring the leg back up

247
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,180
And again, six more times

248
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,180
Ben, and straightened

249
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,180
Squeeze that stomach

250
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,180
Down and up

251
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,180
Down and up

252
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,180
Down and up

253
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,180
Last one

254
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,180
Good, switch that

255
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,180
Left leg forward and right leg back

256
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,180
Now bend the right leg

257
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,180
Knee almost to the ground

258
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,180
Up, up, up

259
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,180
Six more

260
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,180
Down and up

261
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,180
Come on Amy

262
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,180
Yes, I will hear it

263
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,180
Is that where you want to hear it?

264
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,180
Hiders

265
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,180
Now take a deep breath

266
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,180
Last one

267
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,180
Go back off for this week, so until next time

268
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,180
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus

269
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,180
Whoa, what's going on?

270
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,180
There we go

271
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,180
Sorry, overloaded the system there

272
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,180
Amy

273
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,180
Now I can't wait to get home

274
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,180
Now I'm all worked up

275
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,180
You know, I'll be honest with you

276
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,180
When you're away from home for a long time

277
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,180
I don't care how old you are

278
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,180
If you love your partner

279
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,180
If you're in love with your partner

280
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,180
Particularly if you're a couple of time zones away

281
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,180
You know what happens?

282
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,180
You get crazy ass sex dreams

283
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,180
About five or six in the morning

284
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,180
They've actually been waking me up for the past two days

285
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,180
I mean, I mean these are

286
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,180
Sex dreams with my wife by the way

287
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,180
But there's all kinds of other people involved too

288
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,180
Which is kind of naughty

289
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,180
Adam, it's ginger from the day

290
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,180
If you haven't met with a couple of things

291
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,180
First of all, the word literally

292
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,180
I think you have no idea what that word means

293
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,180
Because I've never heard of you

294
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,180
Correctly, at least not in recent memory

295
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,180
Literally means actually or really

296
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,180
You just said

297
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,180
Nokia E61 is literally indestructible

298
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,180
And if it were literally indestructible that means

299
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,180
There would be no physical way on earth

300
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,180
But wait

301
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,180
I have to stop you there

302
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,180
I truly believe

303
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,180
That's why I said it that way

304
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,180
That is an incorrect use of the word

305
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,180
In most cases

306
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,180
In case of the Nokia E61 I

307
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,180
That thing is literally indestructible

308
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,180
It's a brick, you can't break it, you can't mall it

309
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,180
It just keeps on working

310
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,180
Which reminds me, if you don't mind me

311
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,180
Interrupting this English lesson

312
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,180
That you can get

313
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,180
Well, you can purchase

314
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,180
Unless you now am really self-conscious of my English

315
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,180
You can purchase the Nokia

316
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,180
And 810

317
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,180
Internet tablet

318
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,180
I mean, I talked about it so often

319
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,180
But now you can get it

320
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,180
I believe it's pretty much worldwide

321
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,180
At a 15% discount

322
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,180
You can't get this thing cheaper anywhere else

323
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,180
I haven't found it

324
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,180
And believe me, I looked

325
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,180
If you use my code, daily source code

326
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,180
When you check out, it's a promo code

327
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,180
Or discount code, I think they call it

328
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,180
So you want to go to

329
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,180
NokiaUSA.com slash n810

330
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,180
Or go to BTpodshow.com slash n810

331
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,180
Or podshowoffers.com

332
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,180
slash n810

333
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,180
And when it asks you for the promo code

334
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,180
Just a type in daily source code

335
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,180
And you'll get your 15% discount upon checking out

336
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,180
So what you actually mean is it's not literally

337
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,180
Indestructible, it just seems that way, sometimes

338
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,180
So that's less than number one

339
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,180
Okay, number two is the word amount

340
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,180
You say things like the amount of podcasts

341
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,180
What you should be saying is the number of podcasts

342
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,180
You use the word number when it's something that can be counted

343
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,180
Like the amount of love in the world

344
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,180
Water is the number of podcasts on my iTunes quite

345
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,180
Anyway, just some English lessons

346
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,180
And driving me nuts, thought I might as well educate you

347
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,180
Thank you, no, I appreciate that, please feel free to do that any time

348
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,180
And I really like the way you did that, you were just really cool about it

349
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,180
Fantastic, thank you, thank you very much

350
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,180
Well, thank you very much everybody, it's a football Friday

351
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,180
That means it's time for young plets

352
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,180
Well, thank you very much everybody, it's a football Friday

353
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,180
That means it's time for young plets

354
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,180
Fantastic, with Adam Curry

355
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,180
Adam, who are you ready to be stumped

356
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,180
Because he is the fantastic guest

357
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,180
Hit me baby

358
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,180
Adam, this is hit us number one or seven

359
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,180
And this week all the tracks are from 1986

360
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,180
Yeah, with him crown number one

361
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,180
That is

362
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,180
That's the Sun City record

363
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,180
Oh, crap, I give up

364
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,180
Number two

365
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,180
Y'all

366
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,180
Is that

367
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,180
Lady and red, maybe

368
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,180
And number three

369
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,180
Oh, shit

370
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,180
I know I'm gonna hate myself when I get these answers

371
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,180
I can't believe it, I haven't done this bad in so in a long time

372
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,180
And time's up and this is answer number one

373
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,180
Yeah, you're not in the guest

374
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,180
That's it

375
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,180
That's that one, right?

376
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,180
Well, kind of

377
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,180
I'm one place on city, is that it?

378
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,180
Ah, hey, we're gonna play Sun City

379
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,180
And what ever happened to that?

380
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,180
I guess it's okay now to play Sun City

381
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,180
Music for a good cause

382
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,180
Artists united against the fight hide with Sun City as answer number one

383
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,180
And this is answer number two

384
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,180
What is it, what is it, what is it, what is it?

385
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,180
This is Kak Robin

386
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,180
I'll remember the promise you made

387
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,180
We

388
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,180
Kak Robin

389
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:32,180
Kak Robin is answer number two with when your heart is weak

390
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,180
And this is answer number three

391
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,180
I don't know this one

392
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,180
This is total contrast

393
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,180
Because though it's gone you say

394
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,180
I wouldn't have known that one

395
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,180
Total contrast is answer number three with hit and run

396
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,180
And that's it for hit this number one, no seven

397
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,180
Not easy

398
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,180
So at him, how did you do?

399
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,180
I would say I suck Bollocks

400
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,180
Like always, don't just hit this and also the links to iTunes

401

403
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,180
So until then take care and bye-bye

404
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,180

info

409
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,180
Now that this is of course the hittest

410
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,180
Now is the hittest, the football Friday I mean

411
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,180
I was just thinking about my wife and I thought you know what?

412
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,180
It's right, I got to go home with clean laundry

413
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,180
Take one step

414
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,180
And I'll shoot

415
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,180
I don't think I'm afraid of you

416
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,180
You held me back

417
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,180
So I tied you up

418
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,180
The only way you got it

419
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,180
I almost fell down the stroke of luck

420
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,180
Because no one

421
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,180
gets away from me

422
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,180
Till I say leave

423
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,180
I'm on the beach on the moon

424
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,180
Take your words that hurt

425
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,180
You dirty shirt

426
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,180
Walk your ass back out my door

427
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,180
I say go

428
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,180
I'll be OKy by myself

429
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,180
When you go, you will ride

430
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,180
Because every night we will make it look

431
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,180
I was thinking of somewhere else

432
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,180
The tables have turned

433
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,500
Then your goose is cudd

434
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,180
And judge me they has arrived

435
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,980
If they're ready or not, here I come

436
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,780
You're gonna pay for what you've done

437
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,780
And I get to watch you square

438
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,980
There's no one

439
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,980
Get away from me to let's say leave

440
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,980
I don't need your number

441
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,780
Thank you words that hurt

442
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,380
You dirty shirt, walk your ass back

443
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,580
Come back to us and go

444
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,580
I'll be okay if I'm my friend

445
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,180
Let me know if you were right

446
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,780
Because every night we were making love

447
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,180
I was making up someone else

448
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,180
You chased your tail for too long

449
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:46,980
You're a girl, a girl, a girl, a girl

450
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,180
And I guess that's the price you pay

451
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,780
When you let something this could get away

452
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:58,180
You're gonna pay for what you've done

453
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,180
Yeah, let's try baby

454
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,780
You're all

455
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,780
You're all

456
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,780
You got clean shirts, boys

457
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,780
I said take one step

458
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,780
Come on

459
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,780
Take one step

460
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,780
And I swear I'll shoot

461
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,780
You're here on me back

462
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,780
So I tied you up

463
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,780
The only way you got out was the bell

464
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,780
So come and look

465
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,780
Because no one

466
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:57,780
That's the way for me to let's say leave

467
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,780
I don't need your number

468
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,780
Take your words that hurt

469
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,780
You dirty shirt, walk your ass back

470
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,780
Come back to us and go

471
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,780
I'll be okay if I'm my friend

472
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,780
Let me know if you were right

473
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,780
Because every night we were making love

474
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,780
I was making up

475
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,780
I don't need you anymore

476
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,780
Take your words that hurt

477
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,780
You dirty shirt, walk your ass back

478
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,780
Come back to us and go

479
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,780
I'll be okay if I'm my friend

480
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,780
Let me know if you were right

481
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,780
Because every night we were making love

482
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,780
I was thinking so well

483
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,780
You are

484
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,780
Oh, Laura Clap

485
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,780
Man

486
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,780
Haven't played her in a long time

487
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,780
Of course you'll find links to all of the songs

488
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,780
On today's show in the show notes

489
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,780
A daily source code dot com

490
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,780
We'll just go through the a Gmail here for a second

491
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,780
Oh yeah

492
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,780
Lots of comments of course on the offer to Chris Moiles

493
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,780
Lee said for hi Adam just heard

494
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,780
Your show where you officially offered Chris Moiles

495
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,780
1.2 million pounds

496
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,780
To come to work for BT Pod Show

497
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,780
I swear that Chris had a conversation with this crew

498
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,780
Either this or yesterday morning on air

499
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,780
And the topic was

500
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,780
Would you leave if you were offered double the money

501
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,780
I can't be 100% sure though

502
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,780
Because I was still in bed

503
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,780
And semi-conscious listening to my clock radio

504
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,780
You still have one of those

505
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,780
They all pretty much concluded that radio

506
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,780
One is a dream job and they wouldn't leave

507
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,780
Oh yeah

508
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,780
Well Chris was pressing people that everyone has their price

509
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,780
Absolutely

510
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,780
And by the way

511
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,780
I expressly did not extend the offer to his crew

512
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,780
To what is it comedy day

513
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,780
And whatever the girl is on the show

514
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,780
And the reason why is

515
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,780
Sometimes

516
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,780
Sometimes you might want to change your crew

517
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,780
Basically

518
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,780
So I wanted to give Chris the opportunity

Well Lindsay

601
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,780
Thank you very much for for for sending that to me

602
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,780
You know working freelance for mainstream radio BBC

603
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,780
I mean you need a lot more qualifications

604
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,780
If you want to work for me you have to have a you can't be over five foot one

605
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,780
You have to have a flat head and that ears I can grab onto

606
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,780
Flat head is for the beer

607
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,780
You know what

608
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,780
I really appreciate it and I wish I could pay everyone 50,000 pounds

609
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,780
You know obviously

610
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,780
Chris Moiles has an audience of seven right million people that listen on a daily basis

611
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,780
The thinking here is that he could it it means like a Howard Stern deal

612
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:43,780
You know like he could at least bring a million people per day to his podcast

613
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,780
I'm quite caught he already has you know almost a quarter of a million

614
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,780
I think on a daily on a daily basis

615
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,780
Who are listening to the podcast

616
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,780
And if you come away you know if he comes over to the death star

617
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,780
First of all he'll be able to play music with that be refreshing

618
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:03,780
Because of course the podcast version of the Chris Moiles show they have to strip the music out

619
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,780
And of course you can play awesomely cool music

620
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,780
And I'm quite convinced that he would be able to bring a million people over

621
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,780
That's that's really what makes it worth it

622
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,780
So

623
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,780
Honestly anyone who can bring a million listeners a day can make a shitload of money

624
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,780
I will help you with that

625
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,780
I guarantee it

626
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,780
Hey, I'm thank you by the way for ending your comment with sub demographic information

627
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,780
Lots of people calling in lots of people emailing in men was I wrong

628
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,780
Was I wrong about who's listening to this show

629
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,780
I thought it was guys who either 20 years old or 40 years old

630
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,780
Whenever you call in with a comment just finish up with just a quick demographic profile

631
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,780

Excellent

703
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,780
Okay, I'll have a listen

704
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,780
I have a queue up now

705
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,780
So I can't lose my place

706
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,780
Let me just see if there was another

707
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,780
Any more comments that came in

708
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,780
Something about internet bandwidth

709
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,780
I do want to talk about that about the meter bandwidth

710
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,780
Well let's do it

711
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,780
Well, here we go

712
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,780
I thought it was a 20 year old and 40 year old white guys

713
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,780
We got some women

714
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,780
We've got a 60 year old physician

715
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,780
And

716
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,780
I had a

717
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,780
It's Chris here in Nashville

718
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,780
I did call you once before

719
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,780
Ages ago

720
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,780
But I'm a long time listener

721
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,780
The listening person

722
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,780
Some of them are arched out of five

723
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,780
You were I just heard this recent GSC

724
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,780
Or you were talking about

725
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,780
You only have 20 year olds and 40 year olds

726
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,780
So I'm 32

727
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,780
And I guess you could consider me middle class

728
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,780
And I'm Hispanic in origin

729
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:51,780
I am a work in construction inspection

730
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,780
So just a little bit more

731
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,780
That's your demographic information

732
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,780
Keep up the good work

733
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,780
And I will be listening

734
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,780
Excellent

735
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,780
Excellent

736
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,780
That's him

737
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,780
That's our Spanish listener

738
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,780
He's there more out there

739
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,780
Besides a whole bunch of white guys

740
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,780
A couple of white girls

741
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,780
And one Hispanic guy

742
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,780
There's got to be more

743
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,780
You can add up this is John from Dallas

744
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,780
When you call in about your demographic

745
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,780
Get a survey

746
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,780
I am currently on the road

747
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,780
It's 6 to 11 in the morning

748
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,780
I'm driving to Austin for meeting today

749
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,780
I'm 43 married, live in a suburb

750
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,780
North of Dallas called Frisco

751
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,780
I am a electrical engineer

752
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,780
By a profession who has migrated over into

753
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,780
The state-of-the-school world

754
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,780
I am currently a school

755
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,780
I am currently a school based on the engineer

756
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,780
For a large Japanese and a construction company

757
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,780
I also have an MBA

758
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,780
And I'm a part-time musician

759
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,780
So hope to tell

760
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,780
Love you in the unique right there

761
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,780
Hope you win later bro

762
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,780
Alright man, awesome

763
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,780
Thank you so much

764
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,780
You know that's really this is

765
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,780
It's not just the comments that blitz me up

766
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,780
When I listen to you guys calling in

767
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,780
It's what you're saying

768
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,780
I feel

769
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,780
I feel like I was a man

770
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,780
I know I was wrong

771
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,780
That's for sure

772
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,780
Now this track is so perfect for a food bar Friday

773
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,780
It is classic Matthew evil

774
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,780
Even though it's a new song

775
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,780
It's got his vibe

776
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,780
It's got his sound

777
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,780
And some of the lyrics from when Sally went down

778
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,780
But now she's going down

779
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,780
So

780
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,780
What I'm saying

781
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,780
I mean like

782
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,780
Down, down

783
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,780
Nashville's finest on the Charlie

784
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,780
On a footballer Friday

785
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
But even country girls

786
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,780
They don't want to run

787
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,780
Because the pride of the night

788
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,780
Till the city is night

789
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,780
We're laying down like a curse on a small town

790
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,780
The music's swinging and bringing it

791
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,780
The greater girls

792
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,780
Tell the fellows

793
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,780
Get up and get up and get on the train

794
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,780
Going down

795
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,780
Down

796
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,780
Take me down

797
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,780
Don't tell

798
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,780
The Sally couldn't see a future past the end

799
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,780
I've never known

800
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,780
I said I'd fall

801
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,780
The stars with some confidence

802
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,780
And I'd beg for the flow

803
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
Don't you say the sight

804
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,780
Some of the night

805
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,780
Shading at you on the show

806
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,780
The Sally never made it to the world

807
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,780
Now you drive the legs

808
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,780
My body's looking for sex

809
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,780
And cheap whiskey in the back

810
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,780
For the happiness

811
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,780
And suck you in

812
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,780
When the city's to clean

813
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,780
And a stick pan

814
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,780
And a spoon that you go

815
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,780
And a way to keep going

816
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,780
Down

817
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,780
Take me down

818
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,780
And take me down

819
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,780
Down

820
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,780
Down

821
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,780
And take me down

822
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,780
And take me down

823
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,780
And take me down

824
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,780
And take me down

825
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,780
And take me down

826
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,780
And take me down

827
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,780
And take me down

828
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,780
And take me down

829
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,780
And take me down

830
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,780
And take me down

831
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,780
And take me down

832
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,780
And take me down

833
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,780
And take me down

834
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,780
And take me down

835
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,780
And take me down

836
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,780
And take me down

837
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,780
And take me down

838
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,780
And take me down

I'm gonna go home

895
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:50,780
I'm gonna go home

896
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,780
You fishin' that's looking mass, but baby

897
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,780
You better sell your daddy gonna raise that

898
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,780
Wow

899
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,780
He's your money, but honey don't daddy don't give it down

900
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,780
Unless you gotta tell him you're gonna win down

901
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,780
Tell him I wanna get

902
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,780
We're all alone here

903
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,780
Take me down

904
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,780
Take me down

905
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,780
Take me down

906
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,780
Ah Matthew Evil

907
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,780
Down town

908
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,780
From the pod save music network

909

Music.potshow.com

910
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah

911
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,780
Awesome tune for a footballer Friday

912
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,780
Loving it

913
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,780
Okay, one kind of serious thread we've been going through

914
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,780
The conversation about metered bandwidth

915
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,780
Which is going into trial in Beaumont, Texas

916
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,780
Time Warner cable is checking that out

917
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,780
You know, and I believe that this has the possibility

918
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:02,780
The capability to actually wind up becoming cheaper for a typical internet user

919
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,780
Which that may not be us by the way

920
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,780

Dear Adam check my band with usures for the podcast

926
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,780
Audio and video

927
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,780
I'm over one gigabyte per day

928
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,780
Luckily we haven't been hearing any noises about metering here in Japan

929
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:27,780
Ah, hence the last name

930
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,780
Living in suburban Tokyo

931
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,780
We have the choice of two fiber optic systems

932
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,780
From company electric power company

933
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,780
The cable TV system and several ADSL vendors

934
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:40,780
Also there's one pure data vendor offering seven megabit wireless data as well

935
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:46,780
I usually joke that this one, this is one case where Japan took some good advice from the Clinton administration

936
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,780
Okay, I don't quite understand that one

937
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:55,780
Anyway, the interesting part here is the one gig per day

938
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,780
So a 30-day month would be about 30 gigs

939
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,780
That should cost you at a really, really high price is about 30 bucks

940
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,780
That's about if you just take a dollar a gig right

941
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,780
So knowing that that price can on the other end of the pipe

942
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,780
We pay under nine cents for it

943
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,780
And I'm contractually not allowed to tell you how much under nine cents

944
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,780
But it just sounds better than under ten

945
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:25,780
You can see where you're only using so much

946
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:32,780
And as long as we don't hold on to the model of overage and charging then per megabyte

947
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,780
Which I don't think this is about

948
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,780
I think we might actually be in good shape

949
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,780
Hey Adam, it's Sam from Bushman UK

950
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,780
I'm listening to episode 715

951
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,780
So you're talking about meated bandwidth

952
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,780
The cool thing I think it was just in

953
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,780
Saying you know, you pay for unlimited, you just have unlimited

954
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,780
I think that's a crock of shit

955
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,780
You think about your electric connection coming into your house

956
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:57,780
I have a hundred amp mains feed from the electricity grid into my house

957
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,780
But I don't sit there drawing a hundred amps of electricity constantly

958
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,780
If I dare I'd be paying a fortune for it

959
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,780
You know, I use more electricity when I want to use them like a cooking

960
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,780
But at night I don't use them much

961
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,780
So bandwidth is the same

962
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,780
You pay for a DSL line at whatever rate megabits

963
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,780
But you know, you shouldn't be maxing that half constantly

964
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,780
And that works just don't work like that

965
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,780
Anyway

966
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,780
That's all for me, I love you

967
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,780
Great half if you win

968
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:23,780
All right, thank you

969
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,780
Exactly my point

970
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,780
This is very very common

971
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,780
It's common with your current phone service as well

972
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,780
At least according to me

973
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,780
Maybe not to some lazy French fucker

974
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:37,780
Hi Adam, this is an afternoon from Silicon Valley Frost

975
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,780
I'm sorry man, just doesn't with you

976
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,780
I'm calm

977
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:45,780
And I hope the AT&T signal quality is better

978
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,780
Better this time, yeah

979
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,780
I told you that anyway, so I'm not just a meter bandwidth thing

980
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,780
Sure, I won't for it as well

981
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,780
The problem is, well, was the last time that your telco

982
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,780
Actually lowered its rates

983
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,780
I don't know

984
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,780
Sakabla, are you making a joke with me?

985
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,780
And Jolie

986
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,780
And I remember my first cell phone

987
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:14,780
Cost like three bucks a minute

988
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:16,780
That's gone down

989
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,780
Roming charges gone down

990
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,780
I mean, you cannot argue that

991
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:22,780
That

992
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:26,780
Phone calling hasn't become consistently cheaper

993
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,780
Worldwide, aren't they?

994
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,780
Severé

995
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,780
When was the last time you actually paid less

996
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,780
Or telephone or internet act

997
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,780
Oh, Jean-Douille?

998
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,780
I mean, seriously, think about that

999
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,780
When was the last time you did

1000
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,780
And I'm talking about, you know

1001
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,780
Since basically the mid 90s

1002
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,780
I'm not talking about prior to the 90s

1003
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:50,780
Well, man, I had a 64 kilobit frame relay

1004
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,780
That I paid, I think, 700 bucks a month for

1005
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,780
Are you kidding me?

1006
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,780
I don't know

1007
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,780
No, no

1008
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,780
It was really expensive to have an internet connection

1009
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,780
So, that's the problem

1010
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,780
I think that even if we get to a meter bandwidth situation

1011
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,780
We're not going to pay any less than we do now

1012
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,780
What's going to happen is that the templates

1013
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,780
It's just going to raise rates

1014
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,780
For the people who, you know, are being with dogs

1015
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,780
Basically, but we, you know, average users

1016
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,780
They're still going to pay the same

1017
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,780
Maybe even more

1018
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,780
So, that's it

1019
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:27,780
All right, love you

1020
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,780
Love you man

1021
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,780
No, no, no

1022
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,780
No, there's anything wrong with that

1023
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,780
30 years

1024
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,780
No, Oma

1025
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,780
Uh

1026
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,780
Tonset

1027
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,780
California

1028
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,780
California

1029
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,780
I don't know, mercy

1030
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,780
No, man, I think you got a completely wrong there

1031
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,780
I really do

1032
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,780
Anyway, it's fun to talk about it

1033
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,780
And of course, all of us just talking out of our poop shoot right now

1034
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,780
Because we don't know what they're doing

1035
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,780
Where are the people in Beaumont?

1036
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,780
I reach everyone around the world

1037
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,780
Surely within the power of my voice

1038
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,780
Within the, you didn't mean it that way

1039
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,780
Within, I'm so conscious now that I'm getting these English lessons

1040
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,780
Anyone within the, the reach of my voice

1041
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,780
If you know anyone in Beaumont, Texas who might happen to be

1042
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:20,780
In the time Warner, meet her ban with trial, please give me a call

1043
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:22,780
Hey Adam, this is Dean from Morgan Hill

1044
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,780
And hey, I was in this

1045
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:29,780
DFC 2012 and you were questioning how I did the hybrid while

1046
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,780
Let me explain it to you

1047
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,780
It goes like this, you're full of toilet paper off the roll

1048
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,780
And you fold it

1049
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,780
And then in the process of using it, you're scratching

1050
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,780
That's how you end up being a hybrid

1051
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,780
Hope that clears it up

1052
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,780
Hey, love this show

1053
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,780
Love you into home

1054
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,780
All right man, the home

1055
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,780
Thank you very much

1056
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,780
Thank you, thank you

1057
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,780
Thank you

1058
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,780
Let me just see what are we doing on time right now

1059
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,780
What about 40 minutes?

1060
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,780
Being a, wow, 50 minutes

1061
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,780
Oh, well, you know what?

1062
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,780
I want to play a song that I talked about earlier this week

1063
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,780
Hey guys, thank you very much

1064
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,780
For reminding me, not I specifically said

1065
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,780
Could someone please just shoot me an email

1066
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,780
Remind me to play this song and no one did

1067
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:11,780
Luckily, I've been really active this week

1068
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,780
And the brain has been firing

1069
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,780
And all the synapses and everything's working

1070
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:16,780
So I remembered myself

1071
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,780
This was the song I was talking about when talking about

1072
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,780
Chris Moiles earlier in the week about how

1073
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,780
I feel that I am a dysjockey of the, you know

1074
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,780
When they made dysjockey like me, they broke the mold

1075
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,780
It just doesn't exist anymore

1076
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,780
The, I wrote, not only do I romanticize

1077
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,780
Being on the radio

1078
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,780
I actually believe it and feel it

1079
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,780
And this song

1080
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,780
Every single old school dysjockey in the world

1081
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,780
Knows this song

1082
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,780
Anyone who's been in the radio business

1083
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,780
As a dysjockey

1084
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,780
Knows what the song is about

1085
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,780
It is completely to the tea

1086
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,780
Exactly the life of a DJ

1087
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,780
Not very glamorous

1088
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:58,780
And the lowest rung of the show business ladder

1089
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,780
Is Harry Chapin to tell you about it

1090
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,780
In W-O-L-D

1091
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,780
Hello honey, it's me

1092
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:12,780
What did you think when you heard me back on the radio

1093
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,780
What did the kids say when they knew

1094
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:20,780
It was the long lost daddy, oh

1095
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,780
Remember how we listened to the radio

1096
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,780
And I said, that's a place to be

1097
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:34,780
And how we got the job is an FM job

1098
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,780
The day you married me

1099
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,780
It was two kids and I was into a rock

1100
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:43,780
But I just had to run around

1101
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,780
It's been eight years since the left you paid

1102
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:50,780
They've been tell you about what's gone down

1103
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,780
I am the morning DJ

1104
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,780
And W-O-L-D

1105
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,780
When all it hits me up

1106
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,780
Wherever you may be

1107
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,780
The great good morning boys

1108
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,780
Who's hurt but never seen

1109
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,780
Feeling all the fun of fire

1110
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,780
Knowing I'm 15

1111
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,780
The drinking I did on my last baby

1112
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,780
It made my horse go low

1113
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:36,780
They said it didn't like the other time

1114
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,780
When they let me go

1115
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,780
So I drifted on down the toes

1116
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:46,780
Of the home of the delete night talk show

1117
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,780
Now I've worked my way down

1118
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:50,780
Home again near the boys

1119
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:56,780
And I know that's how this business goes

1120
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:00,780
I am the morning DJ

1121
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:05,780
And W-O-L-D

1122
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,780
When all it hits me up

1123
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,780
Wherever you may be

1124
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,780
The great good morning boys

1125
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:18,780
Who's hurt but never seen

1126
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:23,780
Feeling all the fun of fire

1127
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,780
Knowing I'm 15

1128
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,780
I'm making it come on and do

1129
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,780
It has to go to suck up

1130
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,780
It's not the big time

1131
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,780
It's the same

1132
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,780
It's the same

1133
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,780
It is a crazy way

1134
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,780
I just step on the top of my head

1135
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,780
Just make it more with getting too late

1136
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:52,780
There's a caramel that got rumbrar

1137
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,780
From setting up

1138
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:01,780
But it's never gonna go away

1139
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:07,780
Sometimes I get these crazy dreams

1140
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,780
And I just take off in my car

1141
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:14,780
But you can travel on 10,000 miles

1142
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,780
Still stay with you all

1143
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,780
Thinking that I should stop this junk

1144
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,780
And start that record stall

1145
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,780
Maybe I could settle down

1146
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:31,780
If you can take me back once more

1147
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:38,780
Okay honey, I see

1148
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:41,780
I guess he's better than me

1149
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,780
Your older understand

1150
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:49,780
You don't have to worry, I'm such a happy man

1151
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:56,780
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1152
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:59,780
Oh, oh, oh, oh

1153
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:03,780
I am the morning DJ

1154
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:08,780
Head to the U.O.L.D.D.

1155
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,780
Lay in all the hits we owe

1156
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,780
Wherever you may be

1157
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,780
The great good morning voice

1158
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:22,780
Who's heard the never seen

1159
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:26,780
Feeling all the fun if I

1160
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,780
Going on 15

1161
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:34,780
I am the morning DJ

1162
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:38,780
Head to the U.O.L.D.D.D.D

1163
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:41,780
You know, it really is that lyric

1164
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,780
The great good morning voice

1165
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,780
I've never seen, I am the morning DJ

1166
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,780
I'm W.O.L.D.

1167
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:52,780
Of course, this is a fashion, right?

1168
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,780
But the vibe is the same

1169
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,780
And that's what shows like ours are doing

1170
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,780
Call it podcasting whatever you want

1171
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,780
That's what it is, we're connecting again

1172
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,780
I love it, I love it, I love y'all
