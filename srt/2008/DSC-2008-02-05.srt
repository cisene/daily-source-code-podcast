1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta's here at Charlie's 718, Super Tuesday.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
With $16 million worth of airplane scrapped to my ass.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm casting this battle curry.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I want to bet a line.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to bet a line.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
More than these four worlds.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm my loving wife.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I want to bet a line.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to be your man.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I want to be your man.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Cause you're pretty cool.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And you've got to tell that I want to be your man.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I want to bet a line.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I want to bet a line.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Four worlds.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I got to bet a line.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I want to bet a line.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, this is true, man.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, this is true, man.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, this is true, man.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't think it's true, man.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I want to bet a line.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I want to bet a line.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I want to bet a line.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I want to bet a line.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I want to bet a line.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I want to bet a line.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Look down from on high, it's everyone better

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I want to run the show

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, listen to me one

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, listen to me one

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh, listen to me one

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I want to be someone

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, listen to me one

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I want to be someone

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, listen to me one

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Listen to me one

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Haven't heard from me a while

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Still loving, shakes

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Better live kicking off

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Daily source code episode number 718

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Hey everybody how you doing

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Back in the curry manner

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's nice and cold here in the UK

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Reminds me a lot of like San Francisco

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And it's Tuesday morning

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't actually have time to do a show this morning

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But I thought it was very, very important

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Because of course today is super Tuesday

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is the day when in the United States

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Almost all the other states

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You like their favorite for representing their party

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
For the Democrats and Republicans

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I think it's a 24th day to something like that

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And I would feel wrong if I didn't get out there

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
One more time and ask everyone to vote for Dr. Ron Paul

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Because I think he's the right guy for the job

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And he's one of the few guys left

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And you don't hear about him anymore now

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And all of the public debate in the mainstream media

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So please consider Dr. Ron Paul for your choice

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Actually, I was just just looking at his

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
At his site and the $5 million boost

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Going for gold achieved once again

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Over five, see how much is it now

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Here we go, going for the gold

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We wanted to raise $5 million by February 5th

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Today being the 5th, 5.225 million

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's that easy

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You see the current government has to steal it from us

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And Dr. Ron just asks for it

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And we give them a wheel thing

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh man

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I had an interesting day

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes, they can't tell you too much about it

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But it did involve

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It almost seemed like spiced off man

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I had had a couple meetings at an airport restaurant

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
How cool is that

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm a little from Virginia

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
They built a little democratic information

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
About five years old

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
White guy middle class

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
A middle age middle class

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
White guy

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Just know the comment on Ron Paul

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
In Richmond, Virginia

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And I have seen a number of Ron Paul banner

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Ron Paul Revolution banners

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hang on, I hope that's also for

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He is supporters are here also

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And I consider myself one of them

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So Dr. Later, love to show

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
All right man, thank you

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Hope Ron Paul wins

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Gladly

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Step down from from that for him

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
A lot of people sent me a link to

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Barack Obama

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
There's a mashup

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
See if the black eyed piece

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And what is it

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Will I am?

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Someone told me this was

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It was produced by Bob Dylan's son

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let me see you can find it at

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
DipDive.com

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And I'm not going to play the

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
game from here can I

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's well done

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's a message of hope

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a great mashup

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You've got to take a look at it

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Crap, I can't believe I didn't set that up

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So I could play it for you

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's this new and there's a lot of

120
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Reverb on my voice today

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is what happens when you

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You set it all up for

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You know a lot of seconds

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let me see if I can fix that a little bit

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I just the sound a little bit

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Crap, this new set up

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I know if I just had

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Two out of no three hours of time

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I could actually concentrate

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
On setting all this stuff up right

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Then I wouldn't have to do it again

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Of course if I had two or three extra hours

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I would have completed the

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The pod finder episodes

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That I'm behind on and

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I have I think at least six

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Optional tracks ready to go

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This of course is the project that I embarked on

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It seems to be working because I only put one out

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And lots of people have responded

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
With songs that belong on their

142
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
On the soundtrack to their lives

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So hopefully

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't know a crap

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't know it's it's a crazy week

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We're meeting with all of the producers

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
In the UK this week

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We're rolling out some new programs for them

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I mean there's a lot going on

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Certainly today tomorrow and Thursday

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So hey, maybe I'm Friday

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I can do some of that stuff

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Or maybe just want to get home tonight

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't have to work on it

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
More demographic info coming in

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And uh and a French lesson that to boot

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hi I didn't Daniel from Toronto

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Couple of comments about show

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So entertaining but those are

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And stands for in the constant form

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You eat for the government

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Trying to figure out what type of followers

163
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah middle age my revenge

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I actually probably just need monitors

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay, that sound level of your show

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Sounds pretty good on me set up

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Some colors were a little bit low

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But that's fine, pretty good

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And for the end

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I will try to do it in French this time

171
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So to be different

172
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So bedclother

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll just pack it for a guy needs

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And I don't carry

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's almost a house he can't pass my end

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And a cushion today

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Someone else sent in

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
They thought the M would stand for marijuana

179
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But then certainly not treating me that way

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Just to go back to that Barack Obama

181
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's really it's beautifully done

182
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I cannot believe that I didn't

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So that up to play for me

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's beautifully done

185
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They've mixed in

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Classic Barack Obama speech

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
In with the words

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
There's a couple of celebrities who drop by

189
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Who sing on it and it's a message of hope

190
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And although extremely inspiring

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And it really hits down to the core

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I would have to say

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
When you see this of Americans

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's a really Yankee

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is the flag

196
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's a really Yankee

197
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Doodle Dandy type of vibe going on there

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Just to vote for hope is not enough for me

199
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I need some actual programs

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It'll change something

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And that's why I'm endorsing Dr. Ron Paul

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
For president

203
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And of course, you know, right now we're still in the primary

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So you could actually

205
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I guess you can be for a

206
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Barack and for Dr. Ron at the time

207
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Being doesn't really matter

208
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Ask a vote for your

209
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
For your nominee today if you're participating in the primaries and you should

210
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But when it comes down to it

211
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I just thinking about hope

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It just doesn't do it for me

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I need to see it. I need to understand what we're going to go do to make it happen

214
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
For instance

215
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Doug Pilgrim

216
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Doug got sends me the great stuff

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This is fantastic

218
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So somehow a video leaked out on to

219
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't know if it was leaked out into YouTube or

220
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And I've got the pictures here from

221
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I guess this is the Daily Mail here in the UK

222
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It was a French air sturdist

223
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Which I guess can only be air France

224
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Which of course these days is also KLM

225
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's shots inside the cockpit

226
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And it was a video

227
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It looks to me like the video was shot by the copilot

228
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And

229
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And the sturdist is in the cockpit

230
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And she's basically stripping for the flight crew

231
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Now in the picture she has her

232
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
She has her bra on

233
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Which but you know

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The pilots are holding on to her breasts

235
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And they're all smiling

236
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And she's cute

237
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And now it's like you know even this article

238
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's like you know this is outrageous

239
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What is going on at you know hundreds of passengers in peril

240
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I like man

241
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Please tell me which airline this is from

242
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Because I'm going to be flying with them from now on

243
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's just hot just to just be sitting in the back

244
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And no one that that could be going on

245
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Of run

246
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I knew there was a reason I became a pilot

247
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're listening to

248
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000

Businesscast.potshow.com

261
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000

Oh

267
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Nothing like a little just Smith early in the morning for you

268
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Big news over in the lowland in the Netherlands

269
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Television records were broken yesterday

270
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Actually, I should say Sunday evening

271
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
When investigative reporter

272
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Pay to air to freeze

273
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Got to the bottom of the

274
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Natalie Holloway

275
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're on from the slow

276
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Mystery you've probably seen something about this somewhere

277
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I think it's a Nancy Grace who

278
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Has been harping on this. This happened a couple of years ago

279
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
An American teenager disappeared from the island of Aruba

280
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And they hadn't you know that been trying to get

281
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Pin the rap on this on this Dutch guy

282
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You're on from the slow to who is they who lives in Holland

283
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And he's actually been locked up for a

284
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I think a couple of weeks while they were

285
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Questioning him and there's like no evidence the body is gone

286
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You know, so they have no murder weapon, no motive

287
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
No body, you know lots of stuff missing

288
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But from day one you look at this kid and you're like he's fucking slime ball

289
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You know that he has something to do with it

290
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So this investigative reporter spent several months and finally got

291
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Some other guy and of course this is where the controversy starts because he paid him

292
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
To secretly tape they set up this range rover with three

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Hidden cameras to tape this guy and to befriend him over the course of several weeks

294
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
or several months and

295
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And basically getting him high on

296
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
On weed and the guy confessed

297
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Although he didn't confess that he killed her

298
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
He said that they were hanging out on the beach and they were

299
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You know fooling around and then all of a sudden she went into

300
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Some kind of almost epileptic fit and then she couldn't wake up

301
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And the guy panicked and instead of and this is the interesting thing

302
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Instead and it's a 17 year old guy with a cell phone

303
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Instead of calling someone to help him out

304
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
He decides to drag her in the bush is call a buddy of his

305
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
They more or less determine she's dead

306
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And then this buddy of his takes her out into the ocean and dumps the body

307
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And

308
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What is going to be interesting to me is this has apparently been sold around the world

309
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I think ABC news

310
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Purchased this special

311
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And of course the authorities have not gotten anywhere near this type of this type of information

312
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I need the Dutch authorities or the authorities on the island

313
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And

314
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I can't wait to see how this is

315
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Particularly the nuances of what this guy is saying in the car on tape is translated

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
To ABC that's one of the most interested in

317
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Of course you can find it on YouTube

318
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll post a link but it's a I don't have the I don't have a version with American or English subtitles

319
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But it's so

320
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Nothing really still

321
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Still solved as far as I'm concerned because I believe this kid killed her

322
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And has just lied so much about what happened

323
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And to himself that he absolutely believes that he didn't kill her that she just kind of died

324
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Right there or he's not sure

325
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But if you haven't seen it if you if

326
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
If you've heard about it you may want to check that out

327
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Hopefully it brings some kind of closure at least to the family

328
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But wow this kid what a monster

329
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Regardless of even just the story he's telling now and a monster is

330
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Dick

331
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh

332
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Anyway, that's uh that's just but it's been big news that they had

333
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Viewership of 7 or 8 million in the country of only 17 million

334
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's pretty damn good if you take away old people and babies

335
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't have his jingle

336
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But let's just pretend I played it

337
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Polific programmer from San Francisco checking in with y'all

338
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Buddy

339
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't know if it's a program from San Francisco

340
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's in DS-671-4

341
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
When you ask for a destination of a decision

342
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of the night

343
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
To the next time the growth

344
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
While we are not very at either England or the US

345
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
We are hanging that direction

346
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Cheers

347
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah, thanks that prolific programmer

348
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah, lots people sent that in

349
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Some actually said it was two months worth of negative GDP growth

350
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But I think it is two quarters we have not even hit one in the US

351
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
A granted it's under one percent

352
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's going to be 0.40.6 percent

353
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So we haven't actually hit the first quarter of negative GDP growth

354
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But already it sounds like everyone is in

355
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You know they're they're in the middle of it

356
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And there's no question we're going into a recession

357
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't know

358
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Actually, I do know that if we all stand around and say

359
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh man, we're going into a recession

360
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yes, we will go into a recession

361
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Because that's kind of how financial markets work

362
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's all about what the sentiment is

363
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And then there are some official indicators

364
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Like this one like two two quarters of

365
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Negative growth and GDP

366
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And there's something weird going over on here in the UK as well, man

367
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm not quite sure what it is

368
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I can't put my finger on it yet

369
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But I

370
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I already I think I already have reversed my entire stance on Gordon Brown the prime minister over here

371
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I thought he was going to be great for the country

372
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But I think he's just a member of the club, man

373
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
He's he's he almost looks like he's working on orders

374
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And the orders are take as much money as you can

375
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
From the people

376
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
They came out with this new

377
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
This new law

378
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Trucks going into London

379
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Which apparently only are really responsible for about 4% of the carbon emissions and pollution in the city

380
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
They all had to convert their trucks with these

381
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Fifteen to twenty thousand dollar conversion kits

382
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And if they don't have it on by yesterday, I guess

383
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Then every single day you're in in the city

384
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And you don't have an approved conversion kit

385
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You're going to get find 200 pounds, that's about 400 bucks

386
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
How do they know by the way?

387
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
They've got a very sophisticated system

388
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Which you know for a guy like me

389
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's actually kind of nutty that that I live here because they have cameras everywhere

390
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Every single move you make here in the UK is taped

391
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
On what they call CCTV

392
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
If you drive into the city

393
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You're supposed to pay a congestion charge

394
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Just take it money left and right from people in cars

395
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And it's not like the congestion has gotten

396
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Better it's gotten worse if anything

397
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So they're taking money from people left and right

398
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I know I talked about it on Noah Gendo over the weekend with John C. Dvorak

399
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And I don't like repeating the conversations in either program

400
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But there was a big article in the financial time saying that

401
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Because of the new tax changes

402
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Which will affect

403
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Well it will affect everybody

404
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Anybody who has any type of capital gain

405
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So either selling your house or selling stocks if you trade

406
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And stocks and bonds or if you

407
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Have a company and you would sell that

408
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's almost doubling going from 10% to 18%

409
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But there's all kinds of advantages for people

410
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Living here and who have their wealth

411
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Outside the country and only pay for a certain bit

412
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
If they bring it into the country

413
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The bottom line is according to the financial times and

414
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What they're reporting is that half of the wealthiest people are ready to leave

415
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
If this law actually goes through and it's supposed to be

416
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Going to affect in April

417
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I have already alerted my wife and I'm on happy with the situation

418
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And if we've got to take a look at it

419
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But it's crazy

420
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I don't know what's going on

421
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I think it has a lot to do with it

422
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You know these bank bailouts

423
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Which are just huge

424
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,800
So we've got this this bank northern rock which was about to go belly up because of the credit crunch by the way

425
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,200
The US credit crunch. It's absolutely spreading all over the world and

426
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,600
It's not just the 24 billion pounds that's 50 billion dollars that the government

427
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,760
You know dropped in there immediately to keep it from going under there's another

428
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,520
amount about that size so in total I think the

429
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:45,320
The government i.e. the money of the people is on the hook for over 50 billion pounds

430
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,080
Yes, I have it for at least the next five years. It's it's theft I'm telling you

431
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,640
No one asked that anyone if that was going to be okay and by the way you could have fixed education and health care in this country

432
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,880
Instead of bailing out this one fucking bank

433
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
It's nuts

434
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,920
It's really really nuts, but there's no outrage over it. There's a lot of talk and

435
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,480
You know you read articles, but you know we're being kept stupid here

436
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,480
You know what's the what's on the front page?

437
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,080
Let me see George Michael's auto autobiography his second one

438
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,680
Madeleine McCain still dominating the headlines

439
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:28,200
And we really got to start looking through all this crap and getting better information out there because people just being kept stupid while they're being

440
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,440
burglarized on the back end while no one's looking

441
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Crap I need some of the cheer me up

442
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,360
Hey Adam Curry

443
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,480
Yeah, yeah, okay. I know what this is nothing like a like a guy from Jersey the cheer you up on a Tuesday more

444
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,160
You did from Jersey. Oh, Jersey. I hope I can make this clear and concise of the listening to all the demographics

445
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,360
I figured I'd finally call in and take care of business

446
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,200
Do it first. I want to thank you for having shows on a daily basis this past week

447
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
That was clearly last week

448
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,760
I've been listening since August of 05 nice and

449
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,120
It pains me when I plug my iPod in the morning from my commute to Brooklyn

450
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
That's you're not there

451
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,640
Anyway, so about me

452
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,480
Morning bread in New Jersey. We are walking. We are walking. I

453
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,000
I love we Hawking it's the last exit before you hit the Lincoln tunnel into the city

454
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,240
We Hawken Hoboken in the house right here the Lincoln tunnel

455
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:37,400
Now live in Central Jersey you front work with my wife right on kids gonna be married 25 years this June gonna be

456
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,400
47 oh my god bless you my July

457
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,280
Remember my first second here in high school we use they we time shared

458
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,840
We sat in the tell all tell a type with the yellow tape and the eight holes

459
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:58,840
And mechanical buttons pretty wild where we come got into listening to podcast when I got my third generation

460
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,000
15 gig I caught a couple years back and loaded all my music

461
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,840
Come on and I was like well really something more I can do it this thing and don't you know you came about and

462
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,720
With a few other people came up with this awesome thing called podcasting

463
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,040
Keep me entertained during the day can't listen to mainstream radio. It actually hurts me and I put it on

464
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,680
As painful my iPod love my technology

465
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,880
Just bought the way to spot car. Hopefully it'll come soon

466
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:38,520
You know, we got these big gas go with it. They finally finally and next motorcycle right now

467
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,360
You are currently riding motorcycles. Yeah, and that's what I do for fun

468
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,840
Great day love your immediate day care hope you win and as you say on the motorcycle

469
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,040
They look roads be stashed and twisted

470
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,640
What kind of what kind of scooter you got man? Did you forgot to tell us what you're riding there?

471
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:05,880
Yeah, I used to ride I had three Harley's I had a sportsster. I had a soft tail on a fat boy

472
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,600
And I didn't last very long my wife didn't not like it and she turned him into a couch

473
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,280
I mean literally sold him. Is it my wife's been good at selling my toys. I've noticed by the way

474
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,080
Now while that was going on I was thinking about

475
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,040
I'm sure it was something important

476
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:35,320
Lots of emails that came in about the FBI now wanting to set up a massive computer database of our physical characteristics

477
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,480
This doesn't remind me actually when I came back from San Francisco on Sunday

478
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,040
Actually so I you of course you leave on Saturday because you fly through the night

479
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,760
I was in the in the lounge the virgin upper class lounge and for the second time

480
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:55,720
And they these people only travel once every six or eight weeks Jan and John from Magnetoon which is

481
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:03,640
They've been they've been doing that for a long time. It's it's kind of like a record label slash licensing company you should check them out. They're really into

482
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:12,440
Into podcasting and promoting music through alternative means and and as far as I know they're they're doing great business

483
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,640
They're flying virgin upper class something they must be doing something right somewhere

484
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,840
And so Jan comes over and I don't know how you doing and you know, I had I had seen her maybe two or three month

485
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:29,000
Men was three months ago and I'm like on Jan are you doing she says I have two words for you like yeah

486
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
Curse De Hockshaw

487
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,880
Like no you're kidding me. She says yes. It's like one of my best friends

488
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,520
And you know, I'm trying to get her to do another another album over stuff and I just love her to death and then she had

489
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,320
hurt all of the conversation going back and forth and and I'm like yeah, you know, that's fantastic

490
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,640
And she says and she's so beautiful. I've seen her naked in the spa on like Jan

491
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,400
What why are you telling me this if you're not

492
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,560
Supplying me with pictures. I don't have to know

493
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,840
Anyway, she told me that the curse it started up the blowcast

494
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,040
Which of course I didn't write on top of that

495
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:11,400
Anyway, the reason why I bring them up in this context is when we arrived in the UK, you know, I was going through my regular

496
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:18,120
Getting in line to get back get back into the into the country and I saw them hang a left at the iris scan

497
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,040
And she actually had dropped me an email later said, you know, we we always take the iris scan because there's

498
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,200
You know, there's no no lines no waiting and if the thing works of course

499
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,240
I'm like you know, I am so against that

500
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:39,560
I am not voluntarily going to give the government or anyone for that matter my biometric data because you know that it's going to be misused

501
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,600
Somewhere or worse in this country discarded by the side of the road or lost in the mail

502
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,160
And you really should fight against this do not under any conditions do not let the government

503
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,520
Tag you in because it's tagging is what it is

504
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,400
So the bureau the FBI is expected to announce in the coming days a

505
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,080
$1 billion 10-year contract to help create this database

506
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:12,120
That will compile an array of biometric information from palm prints to i scans that would be the retinal scans

507
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:19,160
And here you go Kimberly Del Greco the FBI's biometric services section chief what a title that is

508
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,640
Said adding to the database is important to protect the borders to keep the terrorists out protect our citizens

509
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,360
Our neighbors are children so they can have good jobs and have a safe country to live in

510
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
cheese

511
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,320
This is wrong

512
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,720
No national ID cards fight against this crap

513
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,960
Vote for Ron Paul today, please it's a desperate situation

514
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,720
In your case if you look at hold on hold on a second. Let me get it

515
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,960
Okay, I have it here now by the way. It still turns on but as you know the

516
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,640
The touch screen is broken, so I can't actually use it. Okay, I've got it here. What am I looking at?

517
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,200
Three points for the headset where you put the microphone you know the

518
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,840
ear plugs

519
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,840
The bottom of that hole there's supposedly

520
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:39,240
Something there that acts as a sensor that they'll that attack and tell us the device has been dropped in water really and when you look down inside the headphone jack

521
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:47,080
It will be white if it's never been dropped in water if it turns dark or either a yellow or a black

522
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,360
It's proved that the device has seen water and therefore that voids the warranty here and

523
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,360
I'm blown whatever

524
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:00,600
So hey look down in the whole atom and tell us what the deal is if it's rumored fact

525
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:06,440
I'm looking in the hole now my friends. This is kind of hard to see. I got to catch the light just at the right angle

526
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,920
Hmm

527
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:14,520
I can see the well, I don't think it's a sensor. I think it's just the connector at the bottom

528
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
I can't really say is to if it's

529
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,360
No, you know what if I'm looking at it. It kind of looks

530
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,520
Silvery white. It doesn't look discolored at all. I

531
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Don't think it's true

532
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,120
How can I tell I mean I have no comparison. I need a good one next to it to be able to

533
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,840
Oh, that's complicated. No, I don't think it's true. That seems to be

534
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,560
David and Sophie. That's sorry, David. I think that's an urban myth there

535
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,800
Doesn't matter. I've got my Nokia 810. It's a vice is just fine. Thank you very much. It does

536
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,240
All of my Gmail all of my Google Docs and it plays flash videos

537
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,120
Which means it's it's

538
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,120
completely compatible with

539
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,760

542
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120

549
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,560
So it being a super Tuesday today and that's again really the reason why I just popped in for this rather short show today

550
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
I tried finding a song from the

551
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,640
From the soundtrack of my life that might help us think about to get now there and voting today if you're on your way to work

552
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,360
You make a little detour passed by the schoolhouse or

553
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:05,640
Wherever it is that that you vote and of course I'd like you to vote for Dr. Ron Paul if you're a Republican or if you're

554
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,920
Going to vote for a Republican candidate

555
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,960
Please do that and

556
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,880
Well, there's no song called super Tuesday, but this one comes pretty close

557
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,880
Sun is bright

558
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,720
Or in the darkest night no one knows

559
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,840
She comes and goes

560
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,160
Goodbye

561
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,920
Ruby Tuesday who could hang a name on you

562
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:08,680
When you change with every new day still I'm on a new seal

563
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:16,360
Don't question why she needs to be so free

564
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,240
She'll tell you if the only way to be

565
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:37,000
She would never say where she came from

566
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,200
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone

567
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,240
While the sun is bright

568
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,560
Or in the darkest night

569
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,440
No one knows

570
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,840
She comes and goes

571
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,080
Goodbye

572
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:17,080
Ruby Tuesday who could hang a name on you

573
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:24,760
When you change with every new day still I'm on a new seal

574
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:32,520
Don't question why she needs to be so free

575
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,480
She'll tell you if the only way to be

576
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:53,080
She just can't be changed to a life where nothing's gained

577
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,880
And the things lost

578
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,520
But such a cost

579
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,760
Goodbye

580
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Ruby Tuesday who could hang a name on you

581
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,280
When you change with every new day

582
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,240
While there's still a round thing God for sheep bought.com

583
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,080
They still get tunes like this

584
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:31,240
Stons Ruby Tuesday on a super Tuesday on the daily source code episode 718

585
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,160
I'm off. I got to get my answer

586
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,360

589
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,480

590
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,480

593
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,000
And enjoy your freedom my friends

594
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,360
Because it's fleeing quickly

595
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,360

00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,480
