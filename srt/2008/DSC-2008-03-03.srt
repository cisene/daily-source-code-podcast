1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
then the next generation radio content in my ears.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I guess it's Adam Curry.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Is the evil Adam Curry from the brass guy?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And you're listening to the Daily Source Code, D-S-C-7-3-0.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
More.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Whatever I like, whatever I like,

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you don't want to lie, come every time you go.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:29,000

But cause I'm the same, don't be happy in my life

15
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But your feet, you didn't want to get a chance

16
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm forgetting me, you know?

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

18
00:03:37,000 --> 00:04:01,980
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

19
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:08,420
That's a kind of tune that just kicks off the week and all I'm saying, excellent.

20
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,780
Party Bands, genius of London, thanks to a mainland, our very own genius in London, running

21
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:19,540
the Podshow UK office, actually sent this one name for a Friday's footballer, but you probably

22
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,900
figured out by now that I just didn't have the energy to get into it and do it.

23
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,240
Ah, fully well knowing that Saturday was going to be a Noah gender day with my friend

24
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,080
John C. DeVorex, so I just had the slip and slide it over to Monday.

25
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
Hey everybody, how you doing?

26
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,520
It's a daily source code episode number 730 coming to you from the curry manner on

27
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,520
the west side of G-town, the affluent suburb of Surin on his Guilford.

28
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,760
I have some kind of high pitched, some thing, that my wires are all messed up, just when I

29
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,280
started perfecting all of the software on my new setup, which by the way, a lot of you emailed

30
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,000
me that the previous episode from San Francisco had some kind of weird sound distortion in it.

31
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,200
I heard it at the time when it happened, we just turned this down a bit, so you thought,

32
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
it works any better.

33
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
There we go.

34
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,840
Yeah, I heard it at the time and I just decided to ignore it because I'm sure by now,

35
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,280
most people are pretty fed up with listening to me complaining about the sound setup, but

36
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,440
I knew it was happening in Franco from Rockhouse to Talia sent me a couple of tips for those

37
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,080
of you who were interested in basically had to do with the Mitch Matt mismatch of bit rates

38
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,080
on the aggregate device that I set up in the Mac.

39
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,960
Anyway, I still got to document everything every single day.

40
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,160
I get a little bit closer to this thing being one stable operation that I can just fire up.

41
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,160
In fact, now I'm still firing up like four different apps to make it all work, so once

42
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,400
all of this is stable, which is starting to look like the next step is going to be to create

43
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,120
a script, an Apple script that will essentially boot everything up and configure everything.

44
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:04,320
I guess if not almost completely automatically, and document that's where other people can

45
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,920
set it up as well.

46
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,160
It's not a cheap setup, but man, when you get it running, that was of course was the beauty

47
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,680
of Cass Blaster, which unfortunately only runs on Windows, but you could rely on it.

48
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,960
You fired that puppy up.

49
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,200
You still can, obviously, Cass Blaster.com, you just fired up and it works.

50
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,560
It just always works.

51
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,720
Even with the USB headset these days, as I found out recently, the Candyman ran into trouble

52
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
and figured out that it does work.

53
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,440
Sorry, so now I've got all the software stuff working.

54
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,040
It sounds like I've got some kind of ground loop going in my, I don't know.

55
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,800
It can only be the microphone in the preamp to the microphone, so I'm not exactly sure what's going on.

56
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,600
Um, but I guess that's Murphy's law.

57
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,000
Once you get the software side, fix the hardware failure.

58
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,240
Hi Adam. My name is Anna from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

59
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,960
Well, I just wanted to say that I love listening to the daily source code,

60
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,640
but I love it so much more when Patricia is there participating.

61
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,120
We've used so please, Adam, bring her back.

62
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,800
Hi.

63
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Yeah, I just asked her, actually, and she said, what now are you kidding?

64
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,520
I show now.

65
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,480
There was a, I had, I had to represent for Patricia yesterday in Amsterdam.

66
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,880
It was her, one of her best friends is this Ku-3A, which is like a fashion dude.

67
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,080
He makes clothing high and, um, you know, not, uh, old cootures, so not off the rack.

68
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,240
And he does, uh, obviously does this fashion shows four times a year, and Patricia often works.

69
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,360
They're best friends, so he, uh, they often work together on what the hairstyle is going to be,

70
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,600
uh, she even gives him ideas about the clothing.

71
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,880
He's very close relationship, and, uh, and, uh, they enjoy doing that stuff a lot.

72
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,960
And so Patricia always goes to the shows, and this time she said, look, you know, please,

73
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,600
will you come along? Uh, it would be fun, you know, it'd be good for you to represent,

74
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,560
for the family, for Paul. That's his name, Paul Schulter.

75
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,720
And, uh, well, you knew I, if you listen to Noah Genda, you know, she already bought me a,

76
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,040
a pre-produced, uh, the buying of a suit before I got back from San Francisco.

77
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,360
And then, uh, Saturday, uh, bless her, man, she, she made me feel welcome. Let me tell you,

78
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,680
there was a big welcome home party. And right after all the good stuff, she said, okay, now,

79
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,840
grab your coat. We're going to go shopping for a suit.

80
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,480
And I have to say off the rack almost at Ted Baker, fantastic. I got a couple. Really, uh,

81
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,320
really happy. Anyway, so one of those was for the fashion show. Now, Patricia had some other

82
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,040
business to do. So she left on Saturday, uh, evening. She flew to Amsterdam with EasyJet.

83
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,000
And so she was there, uh, a day earlier. And, uh, so I flew over yesterday, uh, Sunday.

84
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,080
And, uh, as you know, uh, the lady Patricia loves to fly with me, but she won't fly across the English

85
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,520
channel, um, unless, uh, I have a safety pilot. So I had Captain Dan with me, who she, uh, she loves

86
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,240
Captain Dan because besides him being a, uh, a certified diving instructor and, uh, rescue swimmer

87
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,520
and, uh, he is obviously also a certified pilot and instructor. Uh, he is really not needed,

88
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,280
because I can do everything. But I understand if it makes her feel more comfortable. So Captain Dan and I,

89
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,520
oh, by the way, she loves Captain Dan because he's kind of heavy. And she knows that, uh, if we go into the

90
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,120
sea, that she can always hang onto him because she sure he'll float.

91
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Um, and it was, uh, the weather was, um, interesting. A lot of wind, uh, the skies were generally good

92
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,000
and there was no rain and, uh, and the cloud base was pretty high, uh, but we did have rather strong

93
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,720
winds. In fact, we were doing about 200 knots going over, uh, uh, on the way over from, uh, from our airport

94
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,440
over to a hill versus, so right under Amsterdam is a little airfield I like to use when I fly there,

95
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,640
much less hassle and, uh, you know, you're supporting a community of people I always buy fuel

96
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,880
from them if I can. Uh, and it's, uh, and it's just cheaper, uh, everything's cheaper there.

97
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,880
And they have a great little restaurant that has opened six days a week and it's right on the air

98
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,880
field. So it, it's a great vibe and, uh, I've flown there a lot when I was, uh, uh, learning how to fly.

99
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,520
So I love to support them as much as I can. Um, um, but I even called them. I said, hey, I'm coming in.

100
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,960
I want to park the plane overnight and then like, wow, you know, it's really windy.

101
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:29,760
You've got crosswind, uh, which means they don't have a, uh, a runway, uh, which you can use to land

102
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,320
on, which you'll be heading directly into the wind, which is what you're trained for, obviously,

103
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,880
because, uh, you know, you should be able to put this thing down anywhere regardless of the wind

104
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,440
if necessary. So you train for a lot of weird situations, but it's a little more work, uh,

105
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,800
when you're doing a crosswind landing. And this kind of, uh, brings me to a video that's been

106
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,880
circulating around the net. And many people sent it to me. I posted it over on, uh,

107
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:59,840
curry.com on the weblog. Uh, you see, uh, airbus, uh, a 320, uh, landing and essentially performing

108
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:06,160
a pretty much a textbook go around. But it was great because, um, you know, you, the way people

109
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,360
talk about this video is like, wow, man, these people are almost dead and, uh, the pilot only

110
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,040
barely averted a crash and, you know, as airman and dad and I looked at this video and, you know,

111
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,800
it's, it's, it's very dramatic to look at, but probably no less dramatic than if, uh, if

112
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,560
couple of pilots were to, you know, or as dramatic, if a couple of pilots were to look at open

113
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:36,160
hard surgery and see how close the surgeon came to sniffing some, something he shouldn't, you know,

114
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,480
but even though there may have been no danger at all and it may have been very standard procedure.

115
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,440
If that makes any sense, that kind of, uh, analogy. And you should really check this video out

116
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,440
because I just wanted to mention a few things. First of all, um, a lot of people said, wow, look

117
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,600
at the angle of the plane coming in. It's not aligned with the runway and this is true and although

118
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:04,080
you rarely ever notice it when you're in the aircraft, uh, as a passenger, um, you know, typically

119
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,440
if there is some kind of crosswind, meaning wind not coming directly up the runway, um, that plane

120
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,040
is going to land, uh, with its nose into the wind and kind of moving sideways. It's a bit like sailing

121
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,080
on the ocean, if you will. Um, and although it looks weird, if the most comfortable way, really,

122
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,440
I mean, there's another way to, uh, to land in a crosswind and you can basically point your stick or your

123
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,800
steering column, if you will, into the wind and then, uh, depress the opposite pedal, um, and,

124
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,080
you know, the plane will then, uh, basically fight the forces of nature and stay on a steady course,

125
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,560
uh, however, whichever side you, um, depending on which side you depress the pedal and, you know,

126
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:52,160
opposite, uh, opposite stick, uh, the plane is going to tilt and that can make passengers kind of uncomfortable

127
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,040
because it can, uh, it feels really, really weird when you do that. Uh, so typically that's not done,

128
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,440
but at the last minute, what you do is then you straighten out the plane as it lands and then you get

129
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,320
or with a nose straight on the runway. And now there's a couple of situations that we're at

130
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:14,240
at play here, um, partial wind shear, partial crosswind, uh, wind shear is a situation that can, uh,

131
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,720
the most, besides the fact that it's, uh, that it's wind coming from the side typically,

132
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,080
the most devastating effect is that you lose altitude very, very quickly in wind shear and that you

133
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,280
can drop down significantly. And I think that's what I'm seeing on this video, uh, as you see,

134
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,840
the aircraft seems a bit high on approach, but again, you have no context because you're, you know,

135
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,360
you're looking at video and you can't really see the distance as properly. It's just kind of

136
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,320
a guesstimate. It could be completely off. So it's just, you know, my opinion from what I'm seeing,

137
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:49,520
and all of a sudden you see a rapid descent and then you see the pilot, uh, the pilot in command

138
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:56,560
turning the plane, uh, aligning with the central line on the runway and then the, um, the wing

139
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,760
that's, uh, into the wind raises up, of course, pushing the opposite wing very close to the tarmac.

140
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,960
Now I would say it's, and it's, again, you can't see it from this video, but when you're landing,

141
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,160
you know, you want to have your stick into the wind. Uh, you know, certainly with taxiing,

142
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,640
any, any, any time you've got an aircraft out, uh, out and about, you want to have, uh, you want to

143
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,200
be pointing your stick or your column into the wind because that's exactly what can happen. The wind

144
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,320
can catch underneath your wing and then it'll want to flip you over. So he may not have had, you know,

145
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,720
maybe because there was some wind shear. He drops significantly. He was concentrating on pointing

146
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,240
the aircraft onto the center line. Didn't have enough sticking to the wind. And then, uh, the

147
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,600
unfortunate happened is when the wind blew his wing tip up, the other one down, and of course,

148
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,200
he did exactly what you're supposed to do is hit the throttle full and perform a go around. And it

149
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,400
just looked kind of weird because the minute he, um, he was on the ground only for just a few moments

150
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:04,640
and then he hit the throttle and he, um, and the aircraft took off again, but of course, you know,

151
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,040
this wind was so strong that it blew him right off the center line and he recovered. It's kind of

152
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,040
weird to see because the engines are making all kinds of smoke and you can't, you know, it almost

153
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,120
looks like he's scraping the ground continuously, but he isn't. So, um, pretty textbook stuff.

154
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,360
I'd have to say, it looks much scarier than it probably was. Anyway, long story to get us to the

155
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,280
fashion show. Uh, it was great. Uh, had a great time, actually. So I was wearing my new suit,

156
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:39,520
funky, uh, had my, uh, my darling wife on my arm. Um, it was a great show. I have to say this was one

157
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:45,920
of the better ones. And, and I really do carry, and I care about how the models look. I care about

158
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,920
the clothing they're wearing. You know, in Patricia and I will talk about, you know, the shoes

159
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,400
as they're coming by and what goes with what and how it looks and how it falls. And I've paid

160
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,800
attention, you know, for 22 years, I've been hanging out with this woman. So I, uh, I kind of know what's

161
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,720
going on. Had a good time. And, of course, we were going to fly back today. And, um, weather was,

162
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,960
for me, to take a passenger along, it was just on the edge because I knew it was going to be a

163
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:16,240
little bit bumpy because all the advantage we got from, uh, coming over, you know, doing 200 knots,

164
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,120
which is well over an excess of 200 miles an hour. Uh, now we were going to pay for it, uh,

165
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:29,600
by hitting straight into the wind on the way back. Um, and so we were going probably 120, three knots.

166
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,800
Yeah, something like that. And, you know, you mess around and find the right altitude where

167
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,680
where the wind is a little bit, you know, less strong or gusty. And then you can pick up a couple

168
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,920
knots. So we were kind of figuring that out as we went along. But it was bumpy. It wasn't

169
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,920
extremely comfortable because some of this wind was gusting up to 33, 35 knots. Patricia's a trooper.

170
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,840
She said, okay, you know, after like an hour and a half, which is what it normally takes,

171
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:02,240
she's like, I'm ready to land. So we made it into our field, um, just about an hour and 55 minutes.

172
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,440
I think it just took us a little bit longer. And a crosswind as well. And I have to say a little

173
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,880
bounce, uh, on coming in because the wind did catch underneath the body of the plane and push the back

174
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,640
up. And I just, uh, I wasn't fantastic on the landing, but not bad because as you know, when you

175
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,520
go walk away from the landing and the aircraft is reusable, you've done a great job.

176
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,480
Hey, Adam is a David and so these Texas calling again about the iPhone and the water thing.

177
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,040
Uh, today Apple released a technop that the iPhone has an indicator at the base of its head

178
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,880
on Jack that is normally white. As a phone, it's been submerged in liquid or had liquid damage

179
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,560
apples, as that it's half of the dot becomes red or in kitchen color. When the phone has been

180
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,440
submerged in liquid, see Apple document for image they have an insert. You know, that's,

181
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,200
so this is, uh, I guess proof of what we've been talking about, that this, uh, indicator really

182
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,880
does exist. It does exist in the Nokia phones. Uh, but what's amazing is, um, I'm looking into the

183
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,800
iPhone, the one that was submerged and it's really not easy to tell. I don't know if they, they might

184
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,360
have a special instrument or some kind of microscope or some kind of magnifying glass they have to

185
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,560
use because it's just not that easy to see. If the dot is red or I think it's color, the repair

186
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:22,640
is not covered by warranty. And, uh, so there you have it. I guess, uh, when yours landed in the

187
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,480
toilet, it must have gone head sewn down and it must have been an air bubble. That kept it

188
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,400
from getting wet through those, but anyways, there you go. It's the announcement, uh, nine. So I

189
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:41,040
thrown at was dot com. Bye. All right, man. Thank you. I appreciate the update. That did happen

190
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,560
last week. God, man, that that little high frequency noise is irritating. Can't wait. My father

191
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:52,800
and law, uh, is custom building from me, uh, an old school microphone preamp. And then I'll have

192
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,560
all my shit set up. I only have two external boxes. I'll have the MIDI controller for, um, you know,

193
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,920
for my faders and I'll have the, uh, the mic pre, which I've specified. I wanted to be, uh, with a nine

194
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:09,120
volt battery. So everything is completely either powered from the laptop or powered by battery.

195
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,320
Of course, the next thing actually to do would be to use USB power for that, but, uh, we'll have to

196
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,520
think about it. Oh, man, you're going to love this. Listen, it was back.

197
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,800
Adam, it's the nylon. Find that jingle. Oh, hold on a second. Oh, I thought I had the jingle. I'm

198
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,160
sorry. Uh, let's so he read for the nylon. Dun, uh, wait, the here it is.

199
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:50,480
Right. He's back. I haven't gone anywhere. Well, listen to each one of your shows. I'm

200
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,280
Ron Paul on down. And it's a similar Godfather. Just when I was trying to get out, you pulled

201
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,800
you back in, baby. So this is only a warning, because I'm finishing up performing devices

202
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,200
in my team for the next week or so. So not a lot of time. For those of you just checking in the

203
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,520
nylon, uh, our New Yorker and London, um, works in the financial industry apparently. And so

204
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,320
it makes a lot of sense. He's doing performance reviews. He knows a lot about banking and about money.

205
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,240
And he hates me. But he is my threat. Next week, I'm going to do your performance evaluation.

206
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,160
See a 2000 and seven. See what I mean? Um, you too need to have your performance evaluated.

207
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,520
And, um, I've been giving some thought to it. And over the next coming days, um, I hope to give you

208
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,320
some feedback. Meanwhile, um, pleasing you, pull me back in with this stupid,

209
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,400
democratic survey. Here's my problem. You get this whole fucked less thing over the summer,

210
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,760
with you got, you know, everything down to, you know, the size of my underwear knickers on this

211
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:58,320
hole on a second. Hold on. What happened here? What's going on? Why do I have this? Oh, man,

212
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:08,160
hold on. Something's very wrong here. Okay. All right. I thought, well, nylon was talking

213
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,400
I have to be honest. I was thinking of myself, hey, maybe I can fix this home.

214
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,960
All right. Back to the suckless data. What was your problem survey? Yeah. I got no feedback. We got

215
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,440
no feedback. Nothing's changed. And now you do this in a graphic survey. You know, one point of

216
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,080
the fuck less, you know, all you keep doing is collecting data data data data data data data data data and

217
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,680
new data data. The engine, a good no agenda that revolutionary news show that you do with a friend, um,

218
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,200
that was great. Oh, thank you anyway. I'm not getting any information on it. You know,

219
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:50,400
it's too much fucking less. Okay, next week. The dubie back. Alright, it's good to have you back

220
00:21:50,400 --> 00:22:00,560
back nylon. Very, very happy about that. Well, you know, we have released a

221
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,160
cyclist data to our producers, which was a main point of the exercise, so that our

222
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,720
producers could actually understand a lot about the audience. If you took the

223
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,720
cyclist survey, you will have known that it was a lot more about particular types

224
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:19,680
of advertising. And this for the, and also, if, if you hadn't noticed, and I know

225
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,760
you're very busy with the performance reviews, the daily source code,

226
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,280
listener audience data is public data. You can view the results right online. And

227
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,640
if you go look at curry dot com, you can see that I released a beautiful

228
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,680
presentation, uh, done by one of the chuckleheads. So it's a complete community

229
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:43,000
project, which shows, uh, the, uh, the report. And it shows information about us. It

230
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,560
was really a, uh, really a community deal, man. Nothing more, nothing less, no need

231
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,680
to get your panties in a bunch. But welcome back, can't wait to hear from you.

232
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,920
Hi, Adam, it's Matt from Games Weasel on this week's show. We've got a review of

233
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,400
Unreal Tournament 3 on the PlayStation 3. Also, the club on the Xbox 360,

234
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,760
find out what happened when I went to Amsterdam, for an exclusive look at Sega's

235
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,840
condemned to. And you can win. I don't think that for the Xbox 360, that's all

236
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,400
the game's Weasel dot beaty for show dot com. Oh, man, Matt Kotlin on in Amsterdam.

237
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,800
I can only imagine what kind of debauchery that might have been. So normally, uh,

238
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,160
a lot of the, what I had prepared for today's show would have been out on Friday.

239
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,800
So what is it you missed for your weekly wrap up?

240
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,400
That's right. Y'all, let's hit test.

241
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,120
Hello, Adam, this is a hit test number 111, the triple one edition.

242
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,400
And if all went well, I'm in New York City right now. Excellent. Therefore, this episode of

243
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,880
the hit test has been recorded. One week ago. Okay. No problem. If you're ready, we're going to

244
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
start right away with intro number one.

245
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:13,120
Ah, the dungeon. It's a, uh, brother's Johnson, win a stop on in the neighborhood. Yeah.

246
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,960
Number two.

247
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:25,520
Ah, Billy Joel, uptown girls. Come on, y'all. Man, make a part on me. Nice intro, though, huh?

248
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,080
And the final one is number three.

249
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,240
Oh, crap, that's hard. It sounds like it might be talk talk, but I'm not sure.

250
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:44,160
And times up in these are the answers. Yeah. Answer number one.

251
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,920
From 1980, these are the brothers Johnson.

252
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,520
Here's a stop.

253
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:23,440
Number two, from 1983. Billy Joel, this is uptown girl.

254
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:51,120
Number two, Billy Joel. And this is answering number three from 1989.

255
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,640
And a diva.

256
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,360
A diva and respect as answering number three.

257
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,440
In the triple one edition of the hit test number one hundred and eleven.

258
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,840
So Adam, how did you do? Well, I'm two out of three on the last one I would not have gotten.

259
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,200
The answer said to this hit test. And also the iTunes link, so that you can buy these

260
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,320
tracks online not to be found at hittest.butchio.com.

261
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:43,200
I don't exactly know when the page will be updated because like I told you, uh, at the beginning of

262
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,080
for the hittest, uh, as if I went well, I'm in New York City enjoying my ass off.

263
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,840
So next time, I'll be, uh, semi life again. So thank you for playing Adam.

264
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,960
Thank you for your health. Thank you for listening. Next week, I'll be back for number one hundred and

265
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,360
twelve. So until then, take care. Have a nice week and bye bye.

266
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,360
Oh, young. Thank you. I was actually watching his Twitter feed. I think, uh,

267
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,720
I think young is already back and he made it safe. And I hope you did have a good time and part of your

268
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:32,880
ass off. Um, let me see. Okay. For the past week or two, uh, certainly a lot. Unfortunately,

269
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,600
while I was in San Francisco, and I just didn't have time to set up a live DSC, I'll, I will get to

270
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,240
one later this week, although I have a lot of stuff to do in London as well. Um, I want to hear

271
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,320
from the Brits at a time when they can actually participate in their wake to joining on the show.

272
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,600
Um, I, the main focus, I think, well, two things, one of the Northern Rock bailout,

273
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,680
which, you know, and all that stuff, and actually there's three things in non-domiciled

274
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,960
tax status. Okay. But the, uh, the one that is really quite important, uh, is this red pill moment

275
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,240
we've had about what's going on in the UK. And now the, uh, the government has come out with a campaign

276
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,760
where they're actually asking Brits to spy on each other, uh, in a, in a fashion that, uh,

277
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,600
is a really three areas. One is, uh, if you see someone taking a lot of pictures of public buildings,

278
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,360
you should report them, uh, if you see something suspicious going on in someone's home,

279
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,200
in or around someone's home, which to me is the most concerning. And the third one is, oh,

280
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,680
if it looks like someone has too many, uh, mobile cell phones for their own good, because, of course,

281
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:40,640
terrorists use cell phones to blow things up. Um, so it's a, a massive marketing campaign, uh,

282
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,560
which is going out on outdoor posters, radio commercials I played one. Um, and I, you know,

283
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,920
there's mixed reactions, uh, I must say that looking back and I have done a little bit of research

284
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:57,920
in the meantime, that when the IRA was blowing up places in London, uh, there were similar

285
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:03,280
type of warnings, some of the languages, in fact, exactly the same. Uh, but I do believe personally

286
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,480
that this is a little different this time, because, uh, this type of terrorism has a face and that

287
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,400
face is also a face that is just a part of the population of the United Kingdom, uh, apply this

288
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,200
situation to your own home country. It works almost everywhere. Uh, I got a great comment that I

289
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:26,160
want to share for you with you. I had a new from underneath, uh, um, uh, long time listener, and been

290
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:33,040
listening since that 2000, full December 2004. Yeah, beginning of 2005. Um, um,

291
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,760
I just read those adverse from the net police about spying on each other. It made me feel

292
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:44,160
physically sick, man. There's a rule, not in the stomach. Oh, uh, uh, it's just horrible.

293
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:50,160
When, um, when I was a kid, it was all about, yeah, there was stories to it about,

294
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,600
for sure, being like that, you know, neighbor spy on neighbor, you know, default mode is fear,

295
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:02,080
fear of everybody and everything. You want to live like that. These are host, yeah,

296
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,880
that was, that was what we always told the Russians like that. How will our comics work? We're,

297
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,640
we're like based on a world world too, and they're all about coys and things and those band

298
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,040
traitors who they were the ones that self scared and they were watched and they were hunted.

299
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,920
You know, this is really interesting because, uh, I remember a lot of those comics too. We had our own

300
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:25,680
version in the United States and any boy, any man actually who's listening to the show and hearing

301
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:32,000
that high pitched wine when I talk. Um, you'll, you can immediately teleport yourself back to your

302
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,280
youth when you were a kid. And the comic books, I had like battle of midway, um, you know,

303
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,880
where the Japanese were the bad guys and all kinds of comic books. So that really hit me when I

304
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,520
heard you're talking about this. And, uh, you know, we were the plucky brits who substrate to

305
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,640
it on the chin, but also it's down and just come on with it. And I was proud of being British,

306
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,640
you know, and I was proud of being British during the IRA campaign. So we know that

307
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,600
those sort of scary, because that always went off to work and, you know, if we're going to get

308
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,680
a ship or on the tele, something like that. Exactly. However, uh, but it was always business

309
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,720
is usually, you know, they weren't going to, they weren't going to change our way of life. And

310
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,320
then people actually said that, you know, on the tele and, and, and that on the radio and, you know,

311
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,840
face to face. So take note of that. People actually said that. And you hear something very different

312
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:30,400
today. You really do. It's a very, and I'm, unfortunately, I just wasn't around when the IRA

313
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,480
activity was at its height. So I'd love to hear more from the British listeners to the daily

314
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,480
source code to find out what that was like. And do you feel that there were differences between

315
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,400
terrorism, then, which is exactly the same thing, blowing things and shit and people up and tubes

316
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:52,720
and buses and threats of all kinds of, but basically the IRA as far as I know, they were all about

317
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:01,280
bombs. Whoops. This show just got picked up by echelon. Um, so yeah, I'd love to hear from the

318
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:06,480
British. Um, please, please, please call the call the phone number. If you don't have the phone

319
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,560
number, by the way, and I haven't talked about this in a long time, you might just want to consider

320
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:17,360
putting it into your cell phone. And, uh, so here's what you do in the UK. You do a plus four four,

321
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,440
obviously. That's the international cell phone code. So you don't have to, you know, you can even

322
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,960
call us from America. So plus four four two zero seven six eight one three seven five three

323
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:36,880
plus four four two zero seven six eight one three seven five three. Okay, let's continue.

324
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:59,280
I think the terrorist of one or, frankly, still have a lit. We're a bunch of craving keeps, you

325
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:05,520
know, said, um, we're just being fed on like groom's fairy tales and whatever to keep us in line

326
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:11,600
and the fight of our shadows. Uh, you know, I do wonder what my daughter's gonna think of.

327
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:17,760
Of me in my generation, that in this happened. I'm gonna use it so I'm up for a flashball man, you know,

328
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:26,400
um, yeah, it's gonna be done. We go. So, um, the flash mob idea. I still got it out there, you know,

329
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:33,920
I will do anything I need to to support the flash mob to help to propagate the word, but I need

330
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,720
someone else to step up and coordinate. And so far, no one has presented themselves as the

331
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,120
person who's saying, look, I'm willing to give those some actual time because it does take time

332
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,120
to think about it, figure it out. But I think a lot of it can be done from your computer and your cell

333
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,000
phone and set up a flash mob. So, the, and the idea is to get in front of the right cameras,

334
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,800
cameras that will also, um, if not the actual footage, if we can, you know, shoot our own footage,

335
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,640
which will be pretty easy of just hundreds, if not thousands of people wearing t-shirts or holding

336
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,920
up signs to the government saying, you work for us. That's the basic idea. Someone needs to step

337
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,040
up, though. Someone with a really stiff upper lip.

338
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:21,840
It was something. Um, 37 on married, uh, I've got one kid, I've got another one on the oven.

339
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:27,680
Obviously not in my oven anymore. I'm the eldest of seven kids on white. I'm an atheist.

340
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,760
I think one is in traffic jam. Oh, damn. Um, I can't remember the rest.

341
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,720
Right, man. All right, all right, all right, all right. Was it folder? Yeah, I hear. Yeah,

342
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,960
hope you win. You caught a nice chap. Yeah. I hope you win. All right. And I can't remember the rest.

343
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,040
Ah, it's good. It's good, man. Thank you. Appreciate that. You really opened up, dude. That's cool.

344
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,680
And see, normally I wouldn't play anything that long, but that was just full of all kinds of

345
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,160
golden nuggets. And I'm going to listen to that again, because I think it really hit home for me,

346
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,440
certainly. Uh, something I haven't had written down in my, uh, in my own personal production notes,

347
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,640
and again, I'm using Omni Outliner, really loving it. It really works for me. I have to put that in

348
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,200
as a piece of the whole production tool, uh, because it actually does integrate quite nicely on the

349
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,760
Mac. Um, that I want to tell you that this is for those of you who purchased an Nokia 810 internet

350
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,680
tablet, or even if you have the end 800, and you're using the, uh, the new updated OS OS 2008,

351
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,840
you can get this program called Kanola. And version two, I think is now in beta. Oh, sorry, beta.

352
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:41,760
That's a beta in the UK. Uh, excuse me. Um, uh, it's a great way to manage your media on the, on, uh,

353
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,440
on this internet tablet. I used version one quite extensively. It does podcast, but it also will look

354
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:55,360
at your drive. If you have a, what is the PNP router, thingy, thingy mobabi, UNP, whatever element

355
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:00,320
OP, uh, if you have a media drive that's serving up media, it'll automatically connect. So it understands

356
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,280
all that stuff. It's very, very cool. Uh, and I just want to make sure you guys knew that because, of course,

357
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:13,040
you can purchase the N810. You can't get a cheaper anywhere, but through pod show currently, uh,

362
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,040
Actually, I'm, I'm having kind of a bad hair day. I've got it, uh, headphone hair.

363
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,880
And I didn't, uh, I didn't fix myself up for you guys. Hope you don't mind. Yeah, that's dreamtoon

364
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,400
or I've heard about that. That, that looks pretty cool too. I'll definitely have a download, uh,

365
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:21,680
speakin' of, uh, of Nokia, the candy man checks in. Hi, I'm just a candy man again with some, uh,

366
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,640
positive feedback this time. Oh, for once, right? Yeah, really. Um, I just wanted to say that

367
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:34,240
I'm really happy with the way in which this, um, aggregation functionality is now working at Port Show.

368
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,840
So, um, besides aggregating audio podcasts, I've now also started to aggregate some,

369
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:48,720
HD video content into one XML feed, which I then, uh, play or, or I use, uh, an application called

370
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:56,160
middle or my row to, to play the HD content on my computer. And, uh, this, this aggregated

371
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:03,920
Port Show HD feed, which has, uh, both Port Show HD and non-port Show HD content is really, really

372
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:10,400
good way to, to manage and, uh, control the HD content. So, if I don't like a show, I can just, uh, drop it

373
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,680
out or if I find a new show, I can just, uh, drop it in and it will automatically be updated in the,

374
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:23,280
in the XML feed. So, I automatically get the new new feed also in my, uh, let's say, HD player,

375
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,720
whatever, whatever that may be. And, uh, yeah, I think that's, that's a very good development. So,

376
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,960
thanks for, for getting that back into order. I'm really using that on a daily basis. So, thanks.

377
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,760
Bye. Okay. Now, candy man, you may be handing out free phones to everybody, but, uh,

378
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,680
doesn't mean you can get away without the official sign off of the Charlie. So, next time,

379
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,080
let's just slide this time. But next time, please, think about telling us, uh, if you are into

380
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,520
the red pills, the blue pills, the folders, the scrunchers, if you love my hair, if you're no

381
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,200
homo, if you, uh, if you, uh, I'm sorry, that wasn't the correct. If you, if you think I have a great

382
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,320
hair and hope I win. Uh, but yeah. So, what, uh, what the candy man is talking about is, uh, the channel

383
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:09,360
functionality at podshow.com. It really does work. Now, we've got it tweaked and tuned and, uh, streamlined.

384
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,600
So, you can build up a channel. You can even determine the order in which the shows will

385
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,640
poop out of this channel on the back end in, uh, in the RSS feed. And, of course, in RSS feed,

386
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,760
you can put it to anything. You can put it to iTunes. You got to think you can put it into

387
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,480
Tvo these days, even though we have a specific Tvo channel, but you can still, if you want, you can put

388
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:33,120
it, um, uh, one of these aggregated of your own personal channels into, into Tvo, uh, or Miro,

389
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,320
what, uh, the candy man was talking about, or even, uh, canola, a little work, as well.

390
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,080
There's a lot of functionality, a lot of power in, uh, being able to manipulate the, um,

391
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:49,600
the way the order in which, uh, the episodes will pop out. So, for instance, I have, uh, at the

392
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:56,000
beginning of my feed for my, um, on the go channel is what I call it. You can see it at atom.podshow.com.

393
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,760
You can even subscribe to it and then you can follow along. So, you know, you want to check out

394
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,040
candy man stuff because you can, uh, I, I guess if he has a public, you can use his channel and be

395
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,080
watching the same HD content. He can be doing all the work. And you can just be enjoying it and by

396
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,640
the way, he becomes kind of a podcaster in his own right. He's aggregating things together.

397
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,600
He doesn't even have to make a show. He could make great channels. And I, I would love that. I want

398
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,680
to check out the stuff that he's finding in HD. I'll be happy to promote that. Lots of people out there

399
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,600
who want to get HD content. So, think about the power of that. And of course, you know, it is a pod

400
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,440
cast because it's an RSS feed with enclosures, only it's generated dynamically,

401
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,120
based upon what you tell it to do. Another example, I have the weather report first and I have the

402
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:48,080
New York Times front page podcast. And I, I, I select the depth, which means I always want the,

403
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,960
the two most recent, and you can select one, two or three. I always want the two most recent

404
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,040
episodes to be in there because sometimes I miss a day, but I still want to catch up on it.

405
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,280
Now, I'll do the same with tech five, but then buzz out loud. You know, I don't care if I miss one,

406
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,960
so I just want the most recent one. It's, it works. I think you find it pretty cool. I don't think

407
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,600
many people have, well, I know a lot of users have discovered it, but not a lot of people in the

408
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,720
Twitter swoopsphere, if you will. And the bloggo sphere on the technical side because it,

409
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,840
yeah, there's a lot to it. It's, I think it's some good, some good site actually to be quite honest.

410
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,400
Oh, man. Oh, you're not going to believe this.

411
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,320
Oh, I thought I'd have to wait at least a week.

412
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,840
He's back. Adam, it's for nylon. I couldn't wait any longer. I have to comment on this

413
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:51,280
nationalization of northern rock issues. I like your financial support, but you've simplified the

414
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,600
issue there. Sometimes happens. Let me just make some quick points because I actually have worked

415
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:03,360
it. One. Yeah, I do. You have in the US something called the FDIC, the Federal Deposit Insurance

416
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:11,360
Corporation. Simply what they do is they ensure everyone's deposit up to $100,000. That's $100,000

417
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:20,800
insured. In the UK, you're insured up to £2,000 for $1,000. Wow. Okay. This is a big piece of information.

418
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,720
This I didn't know. And actually, I did know about the $100,000 limit that isn't sure

419
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,920
by the FDIC, but I was, I, I, I, I, I, I, I have to admit nylon you're right. I was thinking,

420
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,400
you know, that money's just insured. And I kind of presumed it was the same here. I did not know

421
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,640
that it was only up to £2,000. So now this does make a lot of sense to me that there was probably

422
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,160
a lot more money on deposit or, you know, they have it on deposit doesn't actually mean they

423
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:56,160
have to have it in their, in their accounts. That's kind of the whole banking trick. So yeah,

424
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,400
it makes sense that a bailout was needed to save the bank because if they could, if they're only

425
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,600
going to ensure up to £2,000, I'm sure a lot of people were going to get burned big time. But then

426
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:11,040
the question is, you know, why not ensure up to $100,000 or a million? I mean, they're doing it anyway.

427
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,280
You know, they didn't stop at the 2000. They went above and beyond and wrote another £25 billion

428
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,120
check to ensure the bank could stay in business outside of what was on deposit. I think that's

429
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:29,360
what we're looking at. So let's see you if nylon gets to a point. So clearly, if you have a

430
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:34,400
problem with your bank and the UK, you're rushing out. In the US, you sit back because you got

431
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:41,200
a $100,000 guarantee. Now, you may not call that nationalization and indeed the FDIC is separate.

432
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,240
However, the president and the Senate does approve the five people on that board of directors.

433
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:52,080
It is paid for by the banks. The last thing on nationalization is, during the financial

434
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:57,040
sabronico back into the Great Depression, most people will tell you it's because the federal reserve

435
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,400
refused to intervene to the Great Depression that had happened. It refused to lend money to the

436
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,640
banks. It refused to get involved. A lot of reasons legal and otherwise. So anyway, not just

437
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:14,480
to find that situation, but as usual with the US in UK, you're separate by common language.

438
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,640
There is no deposit insurance in the US in the UK. Sorry, there is a $100,000 in the US at the

439
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,880
FDIC. So, the issue is on that simple. Because bank failures in the US don't have the same

440
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,520
impact, whether it would have had here. And the government would have had to step in. I.E.

441
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:38,800
Look at the Great Depression as a lesson from history. I'll see you soon. But nylon back.

442
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,960
Anyway, that nylon back in my life, back in our lives. So happy about that nylon.

443
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:52,400
Okay. Well, that does put a new perspective on things. I appreciate that. So, I still remain

444
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,840
at my point that the government wrote some pretty big checks to save the bank. Yes.

445
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,040
It avoided perhaps something like the Great Depression, but don't we?

446
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,720
Well, I'm starting to maybe revise my thinking on this. We do have to go through

447
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,360
something so that a pain has to be taken somewhere. The only thing that is pissing me off right now

448
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,000
is the pain doesn't seem to be with the people who caused it, namely the banks. And they're just

449
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,920
right and shit off left and right. You know, I'm sure it goes way beyond the subprime cart crisis.

450
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,600
This is banking in general, which is all about credit and debt. And I think that just

451
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,080
washing everything out as quickly as they can. But there's some huge, I saw an estimate over the

452
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:41,520
weekend in the paper that it went all of a sudden done. 600 billion, I guess it was pounds.

453
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:47,760
I'll just say dollars to be on the safe side because I do mess that up a lot. 600 billion of

454
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,360
anything is a lot. But that's probably the amount of money that will just have been destroyed,

455
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:59,120
just written off and then everyone would be kind of back to a new basic level and we'll all trust

456
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:06,240
each other again and we can continue on banking is usual, I guess. I love to hear more, nylon.

457
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,480
As always, it's highly appreciated and you know that I think you have great here. I love you,

458
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,600
you know, homo and I do hope you. Hey, Adam, what's up? It's Monk and Phil Monk. He's a testimonial

459
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:22,800
to the power of podcasting. All right. Cool. And in audit of digital distribution for my

460
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:32,480
releases through December 31st, 2007, I was shocked to find 12,151 purchased downloads have been registered

461
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:41,760
12,151 for me in unsigned, independent artist. Now we're talking about international digital

462
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,040
distribution like iTunes, iTunes, Europe, iTunes, Japan, iTunes, Canada, Rhapsody, Napster,

463
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,440
Sony Connect Verizon, music match, music blah, blah, blah, blah, I'm not saying music and a bunch

464
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:00,480
of me leaving out. Now I hadn't released a record since 2003. So I'm wondering where the hell did

465
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,680
these numbers come from? Where did they come from? I'm fine. Podcasting, my brother. All thanks to you,

466
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:11,760
Marc Yoshimoto, NMConf, CC Chapman, and the Army of Podcastors all over the world who took my

467
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:18,000
music under their wing and exposed it to quite literally the world. It is because of every single

468
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,400
one of you that I now release my third album, Modest Among the Living. The physical CD is now available

469
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,400
at CDbaby.com and will soon be available in all the aforementioned digital distribution outlets I

470
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,640
rattled off. There are also new tracks in the PMNs that check those out. Modest Among the Living

471
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:42,720
is a big, huge, thank you to the podcast and community. You've all honored me with the home.

472
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,640
Thanks Adam.

473
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:07,680
It's not to say that I don't take chances of at my share of the ledge, but all these steps

474
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:19,600
are not repetitive dances. I'm pouring me to jail. It took three days to float this night.

475
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,280
Now I have to definitively decide what to do in the days of hate.

476
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:43,280
I try to take my try to plan a new life, but I just can't scratch that edge.

477
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:51,280
I watch another episode that I take a lot of plan life has on the couch.

478
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:58,320
Why can't I grab the remote and change the channel on my hold of time?

479
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:03,840
We're headed to 30 days to float this night.

480
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:12,560
Now I have to definitively decide what to do in the days of hate.

481
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:28,560
Now I steal, breaks myself again, but I don't want to make it.

482
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:42,560
It's not to say that I don't take chances of at my share of the ledge, but I just can't touch it.

483
00:49:42,560 --> 00:50:04,560
It took three days to float this night.

484
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:10,560
Now I have to definitively decide what to do in the days of hate.

485
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:22,560
It's been 30 days of hate in my life. Each day is the same one for me.

486
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:34,560
When I'm hanging on my dreaded, make it all out, make it all out.

487
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:44,560
Now yeah, that's Mark from the pod save music network 30 days on the daily source code.

488
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,560
Episode 7 30.

489
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:53,560
The ketchup edition, there you go. Oh man, awesome, so happy it's all going so well. This is it.

490
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,560
Man, this is how the music revolution takes place.

491
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,560
It's all about the promotion of the marketing my friends.

492
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,560
That's what the pod save music, that work is for. You've got to get the word out.

493
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,560
If there's someone doing some shit you like, you've got to play him. You've got to let people know.

494
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:14,560
You've got in bed, you know, players. In fact, I'll put a link into into monks player on podshow.com slash music.

495
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,560
And you can embed that. And it's configurable.

496
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,560
All kinds of stuff you can do with it. This is how it works.

497
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,560
And then let it just be available anywhere. Let people pay for it.

498
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:29,560
I mean, this is one of the few guys I can listen to a whole quote album of his.

499
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:33,560
I mean, I can listen to a whole playlist of songs and just doesn't get boring for me.

500
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,560
In fact, this is the kind of guy I think Patricia should be working with. He does.

501
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,560
So he's got like some throwbacks, 60, 70s vibe in there. He's got some real hard edge rock.

502
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,560
I think that I think that really worked together well.

503
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,560
I'll have to work on the lady Patricia.

504
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:53,560
In fact, yeah, I have to work on her tonight anyway.

505
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,560
All right, I'm going to get out of here. It's been way too long.

506
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,560
Hopefully, as he tomorrow is going to be a little tough.

507
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,560
Wednesday, I'll have a show tomorrow starts at 8 a.m.

508
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:04,560
For me, and it goes until well into the hours of the morning.

509
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,560
So look for another show Wednesday.

510
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,560
I appreciate you listening. Sorry.

511
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,560
It took so long to get another Charlie out for you.

512
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,560
My bad.

513
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,560
