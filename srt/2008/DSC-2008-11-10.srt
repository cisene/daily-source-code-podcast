Delta Sierra Charlie, a 0-4.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,160
$16 million worth of airplane straps by us.

To the next generation radio contenting my ears.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,160
We don't need enough digging trees.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,160
I like to think I'm signed with you this year.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,160
I guess it is a foodie.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,160
That's right, everybody coming to you from the Big Apple.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,160
New York, New York, it's a daily source code.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,160
I'm Monday, November 10, 2008.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
I'm going to roll it.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,160
With a hotel room.

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,160
I'll take it off.

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,160
I'll run this money on the left and the right.

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,160
I'll just need you to try and sign my name.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,160
Yeah.

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,160
Tell me I'm ready until the same old sign.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,160
Tell me I'm talking, tell me tell me,

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,160
The way the weather went down.

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,660
All the time, we said, let me tell you my name

20
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,660
And now it's time to fuck it

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,660
And get the squad and come out

22
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,660
They take the money, they're the same

23
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,660
Everybody's ready to turn away

24
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,660
The money, they take the money, they're the same

25
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,660
All we do, we want to take the money

26
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,660
From the way to the play

27
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,660
They take the money, we'll see

28
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,660
They take the voluntarily, somebody

29
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,660
They take the money, we see

30
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:48,660
They take the money, people are the same

31
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:54,660
All we do, we want to take the money, they're the same

32
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:24,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

33
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:54,660
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

34
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:24,660
yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah you love me. yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah you love me, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

35
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,660
Change the world is in the same

36
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,660
Now we will be able to change the way

37
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,660
The world changes the world is in the same

38
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,660
Now we will be able to change the world

39
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,660
Now we will be able to change the world

40
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,660
Now we will be able to change the world

41
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,660
Now we will be able to change the world

42
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:52,660
Now we will be able to change the world

43
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,660
Now we will be able to change

44
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,700
Yeah, Tommy Keith and the boys

45
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,700
Cinderella

46
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,660
The more things change the more they stay the same

47
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,660
Kicking off daddy source code episode

48
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:14,660
No. 804, coming to you from a hotel room in New York City

49
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,660
Traveling with my friends

50
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,660
I've got the the true mobile set of

51
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,660
We haven't done this in a long time.

52
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,020
A show from a hotel room.

53
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,500
It's been, man, I'm trying to think now.

54
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,540
This may actually be months and months and months.

55
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,340
And this has happened.

56
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,220
Well, here I am back in the United States.

57
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,740
I might want to add to that.

58
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,700
It's been very easy for me to get into the country recently.

59
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,020
I'm off the list, which is nice, not quite sure what happened,

60
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,340
but apparently talking shit about it for months

61
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,020
on end has some kind of result.

62
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,620
And apparently, you actually can get off the list,

63
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,700
not the no-fly list.

64
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,780
This is the customs and border protection agency list.

65
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,660
So we're here for a week of sales, not my favorite

66
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,420
or a way to occupy my time, but this is actually

67
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,500
it is a perfect time to be in New York to do this

68
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,700
just before Thanksgiving is a lot of activity.

69
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,660
And we got a lot of good stuff to sell.

70
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,260
We got a lot of awesome shows on our network.

71
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,740
If you haven't seen the new moveyupmiveo.com,

72
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,980
there's a lot of changes.

73
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,500
We've got our four networks, men,

74
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,180
media, women, media, tech, media, music.

75
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,100
I've been doing some of the home page channel stuff.

76
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,140
It's been a lot of fun.

77
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,940
And advertisers responding very positively do it.

78
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,580
It looks like there is money flowing out

79
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,740
of traditional media into our world, which is good,

80
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,500
because we need some of that.

81
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,660
Thanks.

82
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,260
I gotta tell you, just listen to that song, Cinderella.

83
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,180
And man, I think I have one of their,

84
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,580
I think somewhere, back at the manner,

85
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,180
I have a Cinderella, either a gold or a platinum disc on the wall.

86
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,620
I mean, we used to hang out a little bit back in the day.

87
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,740
I wonder what happened to Cinderella?

88
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,340
They still around, or they still performing.

89
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,420
Someone sent me an email that's living color,

90
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,620
which I played the other day.

91
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,900
And I'll also talk about, I know, a gender.

92
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,020
They're still out gigging around, gigging in Germany right now.

93
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,140
So they're nice to know that those guys are doing OK.

94
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,140
But that was going on with Cinderella.

95
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,620
And when I listened to that song, I'm thinking, oh, man.

96
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,140
Yes.

97
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,420
And it's really great.

98
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,420
And on the other hand, it's really difficult for me,

99
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:27,060
because everything is so crystal clear right now at the moment to me.

100
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,740
It is, you know, particularly when it comes to what's going on

101
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,260
in the financial world, which hits all of us one way or the other,

102
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,380
it just seems so obvious.

103
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,780
And we've got this big summit coming up on the 15th,

104
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,780
which really would be no more than a photo op as far as I'm concerned.

105
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,740
Just taking out the, you've probably heard about this Bretton Woods

106
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,740
to this, of course, as Bretton Woods refers back to the 70s

107
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,100
when they created this, the current global financial system,

108
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,020
although it wasn't really advertised as global.

109
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,860
And now that's completely where it's going.

110
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,980
I'm just going to read off a couple of links, of course,

111
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,340
just about everything once again, sourced from the wonderful source

112
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,580
code drop.au slash daily source code.

113
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:15,500
I read this page, this website, many, many times a day.

114
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,100
It is truly where I get the news that I'm interested in.

115
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,580
And sometimes, you know, there's like a naked picture of an

116
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,300
internet or at least a Photoshop, you know, then that, that helps, too.

117
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,700
This is all good stuff.

118
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,980
So this came out today, this is from Reuters,

119
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,260
and just listened to the language that is being used.

120
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,860
In his annual speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet, Gordon Brown,

121
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,580
the unelected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,

122
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,300
I just want to point that out that the, the good people of the United

123
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,780
Kingdom would not elect their prime minister, their so-called leader.

124
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,980
They, that happens within the party, which is very typical and very

125
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,900
different, of course, from the United States, where we think we have

126
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,620
a choice between parties, but really, which is voting for the better

127
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,740
actor, you know my stance on that.

128
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,220
Anyway, Ron, who is spearheaded calls for reform of international

129
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,460
financial institutions, we'll say, as he did today, that

130
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,220
Brittany, United States and Europe are key to forging here.

131
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,220
It comes a new world order.

132
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,220
Yeah.

133
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,940
Finally, finally, they've done it.

134
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,740
And it all is starting to click in my head.

135
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,100
It's like fireworks.

136
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,500
The synapses are firing.

137
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,940
Remember, we were talking about the Lisbon Treaty.

138
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,060
And this also, you can find on the source code drop, I'll see if I

139
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,820
put a link in the show now in today's source code.com, crossposts that

140
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,460
at curie.com, the latest communication from the European Union.

141
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,500
So let's just go back to the Lisbon Treaty.

142
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,700
The Lisbon Treaty was supposed to be the actual constitution of the

143
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,420
United States of Europe, been talking about this for over a year.

144
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,140
You know, remember the actual constitution, the constitutional document was

145
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,620
voted down by the French and by the Dutch in national referenda.

146
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,260
That's the plural of referenda or referendums.

147
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,460
Well, more than one referendum, each country, they had referendums in

148
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,260
their country and they could vote.

149
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,620
And they both said, no, thank you.

150
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,580
We're not interested in in this.

151
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,700
We don't think we needed, of course, the EU started as the European Commonwealth

152
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,980
as a, basically, a trade union.

153
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,300
Then we kind of got duped into this idea of, hey, you know, let's all have the same

154
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,300
money.

155
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Yeah, that's a pretty good idea.

156
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,260
Since I can go to Germany or France or Spain or any place in Europe, and

157
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,260
I can use the same money.

158
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,260
That makes a lot of sense.

159
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,580
That makes things easier.

160
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,460
But then they started coming out with all this stuff.

161
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,340
And they wanted laws and possibly an army and, you know, taxation and

162
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,220
all this complicated stuff and no one liked it.

163
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,420
They just didn't like it.

164
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,700
Whether we understood it or not, we didn't like it.

165
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,580
And of course, the representative governments true to form said, OK,

166
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,860
then we'll just create a new document.

167
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,780
We'll take out all the constitutional stuff.

168
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,500
So it doesn't actually mean you have to have a referendum on it.

169
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,180
And we'll ram that through.

170
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,220
And there was one country out of the member states of the European Union,

171
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,940
who did have a referendum based on their local constitution,

172
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,020
that being Ireland, God bless the Irish.

173
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,780
They took one look at this document, which we've discussed many, many times

174
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:24,220
on the daily source code, right down to the basic fundamentals of human

175
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,180
rights, where there's all kinds of funky shit going on in there,

176
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,820
where they can take your children away.

177
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,780
And the death penalty is OK, as long as you're trying to run away from law

178
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,180
enforcement, then a kill would be considered legal and clean.

179
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,300
Not just some of that minor stuff like that.

180
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,380
Though, and of course, you can always be incarcerated if you're an alcoholic,

181
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,140
a drug addict, a vagrant or mentally insane.

182
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,580
Well, I think I hit just about every single one of those boxes,

183
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,140
except for the alcohol bit.

184
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,460
And they needed to have this done by October.

185
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,260
What was so significant about October?

186
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,260
Well, it all starts to come together.

187
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,220
When you see what's happening now, of course, with our global financial crisis,

188
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,860
they clearly knew this was coming.

189
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,380
By the way, not just the leaders knew this was coming.

190
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,460
We all knew this was coming.

191
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,700
I've been saying this for months.

192
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,180
And now when you read the latest communication from the European Commission,

193
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,940
an unalected commission, kind of the Starfleet Command,

194
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,780
as I like to call it, their October, think 28th or 29th,

195
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:27,220
the community, they say we will act according to the Lisbon principles.

196
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,020
Well, it's not interesting.

197
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,660
The Lisbon principles, basically the way I read that is,

198
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,940
we're just going to go ahead and hold ourselves to everything we set up

199
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,540
in the Lisbon Treaty.

200
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,980
This thing was unreadable, except for the actual bits that I took,

201
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,220
you know, weeks to figure out to understand and all these different documents

202
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,980
that are referenced all over the place and protocols.

203
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,860
And all kinds of crap, basically, hiding what the true intent is.

204
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,060
I presume that this all comes down to this new world order,

205
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,700
this new financial order that Tessar Kozzi and Merkel and Brown,

206
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,900
and, of course, the United States and everyone's getting together.

207
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,180
And the banks essentially are going to control the way things roll.

208
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:19,820
And as you know, once you control the money, you don't actually need to be in charge of the law.

209
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,940
And a couple other things started to click for me.

210
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,420
This was a news report from, actually, this one is from Fox News,

211
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,740
but I've seen it on many other news sites,

212
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,180
some somewhat more credible.

213
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,660
This is actually from 2005.

214
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,060
Now, AIG is in the news.

215
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,620
This is the insurance group, American International Group,

216
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,260
who we bailed out the United States citizens for 80 plus 80 thing,

217
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,060
85 billion dollars, and for that we receive something in exchange,

218
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,860
80% of something not quite sure what.

219
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,900
But now, looking back to 2005, I didn't know about this.

220
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,260
Someone pointed this out to me.

221
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,420
I'll just read this from the news story.

222
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,940
billionaire investor Warren Buffett was questioned by regulators Monday,

223
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,900
in connection with federal and state probes into the insurance company, AIG,

224
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,140
saying afterwards, I told them everything I know.

225
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,660
And if you read through this article, it seems like there was,

226
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,780
and this also involves, Ellie, it's Spitzer, who was doing,

227
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,500
who was conducting the investigation, who, of course, completely got boneed,

228
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,500
when they set them up with the hooker scams.

229
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
And which, of course, is really stupid.

230
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,300
I mean, if you're going to be going around shouting in everybody,

231
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,980
you'd at least better be pretty clean or com-clean about the things that you're doing.

232
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:54,300
But basically, Berkshire Hathaway, which is, which is, sorry, just lost my page here,

233
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,300
which is Buffett's insurance, so, or his investment vehicle,

234
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,060
they're really big into reinsurance, mainly through general recorp.

235
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,140
And I don't want to get into the technical details of it,

236
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,660
but this has been, there's been all kinds of shit going on between

237
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,180
the regulators between Warren Buffett and AIG.

238
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,860
And now just think back to a couple of weeks ago, when Warren Buffett,

239
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:28,780
all of a sudden, put $5 billion into Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs,

240
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,220
of course, just, just connecting all the dots for a Goldman Sachs, of course,

241
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,980
Hank Paulson, the current secretary of the Treasury, was the CEO at,

242
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,380
at Goldman Sachs, do you think that there's, like, a payoff going on here,

243
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,460
and the things had to be settled out, or someone had to be made whole in the end,

244
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,980
that's exactly what it feels like to me. And, you know, as I said, I'm seeing more and more of this stuff,

245
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:59,260
more and more of this stuff that is just, it's all coming to a head right now, as we speak.

246
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,380
Everything is starting to click together.

247
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,180
Now, something really weird that I have not seen in mainstream news at all.

248
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,260
And actually, you put this on the drop the other day. There were two stories.

249
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:22,220
One was from CNN, where CNN said that the U.S. Treasury was now making bonds available.

250
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:33,820
So, U.S. Treasury bonds starting, I guess, today, selling $550 billion worth of bonds,

251
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,980
trying to raise money, obviously, because, well, look, you know, we've been shelling out

252
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,980
trillion, so we got to go get some, we got to go borrow it, otherwise we have to print it.

253
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:47,660
But what's interesting is that the BBC reported on the same story, only they didn't have

254
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:54,220
550 billion, they said 55 billion, which also these days, you know, by the standards we run with,

255
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:00,380
it seems almost an insignificant amount. So, I'm a little confused about what it really is,

256
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:07,100
and why that's not being reported on at all. In the meantime, Bloomberg, the news agency

257
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:18,380
has filed a lawsuit against, I guess, the Treasury, I'm bringing up the story right now,

258
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,900
for some reason, the bandwidth here sucks is really slow. For some reason, it's a hotel for

259
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,500
crisis, what do you expect? Everyone download and pour in the middle of the night.

260
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:35,740
Because, yeah, we have the 700 billion that was approved and went through the Senate and through

261
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:42,940
Congress. What is it? Why is it all sudden? I hope my microphone batteries aren't

262
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,780
emptying out here. Sounds a little crummy, I'm sorry, just have to live with it, I'll see if I can

263
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:53,180
fix it later this week. Here we go, the Federal Reserve is refusing to identify

264
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:00,460
the recipients of almost $2 trillion of emergency loans from American taxpayers,

265
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,500
or information about the trouble assets that the Federal Reserve Bank accepted as collateral.

266
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:14,780
So, the 700 billion we all knew about, big to do, big who, you know, we all know how that went down,

267
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,020
and of course they'll tell us something about what they did there, but that the Federal Reserve

268
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,980
is saying, I'm sorry, we're not going to give you this information. It's none of your business,

269
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:30,060
you cannot file a freedom of information act to request against us. That $2 trillion, we don't have

270
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:38,380
to tell you. And it just blows my mind that this is going on. Blows my mind, it's our money

271
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:45,100
and they're just taking it and giving it away to their buddies, and I'm seeing all of this unfold,

272
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,540
and I'm seeing, now we had, was it China just put it, and it seemed like every single

273
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:57,420
massive continent or country is kind of at the half trillion to a trillion dollar mark in their

274
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:03,100
stimulus packages, Germany is done at China's done at the United States is done at, you know,

275
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:09,100
kingdom is done, and still not going to be enough. All of our money is systematically being taken away

276
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:15,980
from us and given to these banksters and they're not passing it on down the line.

277
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,780
So that means, of course, that somehow there's going to have to be more money pumped into the economy,

278
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,620
that'll come in the form of stimulus packages. We're going bankrupt. We're going bankrupt,

279
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:35,180
and the banks are controlling this, and the timelines make sense the way it's all coming together

280
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:41,340
now this week. Again, in my mind, it's just a photo op. This has all been completely set up in

281
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,300
advance. They knew about it and God knows and God help us what's coming.

282
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:02,220
Hey, Adam, how you doing? I'm not this. It has number 146. All right. Start right away.

283
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:10,020
Oh, y'all, I think I'm going to like today's hit test.

284
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,660
That is, of course, the incomparable banana ramma with Robert De Niro's calling.

285
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,660
Talking Italian.

286
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,660
Number two.

287
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,660
Okay.

288
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:28,240
It's good to be that mid-lear, but I think it's the Rolling Stones version of Beast of

289
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,060
Bird and I, y'all, good songs.

290
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,860
And number three.

291
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,420
Billy Idol, I was about to face, oh, will he get six out of six today?

292
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,420
I think so.

293
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,020
Let's hear the answers.

294
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,620
On hit test 146.

295
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,300
And that's it in its time for the answers.

296
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,620
And this week they're all from 1984.

297
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,300
The Rolling Test.

298
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,340
And this is answer number one.

299
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,300
This is banana ramma, Robert De Niro's rating.

300
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,820
Do I say calling?

301
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,820
Right.

302
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,820
I'm not waiting.

303
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:26,020
Robert De Niro's rating, banana ramma answer number one.

304
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,180
And this is answer number two.

305
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,700
That mid-lear, right?

306
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
It's the burden.

307
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
That way, that now.

308
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,900
I'll never be your beast.

309
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,900
Bird and I, y'all, all this to you, to me.

310
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,900
Go to me.

311
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:50,620
Bird and I, y'all, to me, I'll never be your beast.

312
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:58,580
Bird and I, y'all, to me, that mid-lear.

313
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,500
As answering number two.

314
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,660
On, this is answer number three.

315
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:11,460
This is Billy Idol.

316
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,940
One more Pat, Grey.

317
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,180
One moreкус, Rig Frouper.

318
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:25,260
I have a lot of days,

319
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:36,420
And so number three Billy Idol and I's without a face and that concludes hit this number

320
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,780
one four six

321
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:45,820
So Adam yeah, how did you do this? I'm looking at the judges and I think I'll let me slide on a couple of

322
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,100
imperfections here. I'm just gonna say I got six out of six. I got names, titles, everything

323
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,060
all right this time yeah. I'm ready thanks for playing Adam. Thank you. By the way this

324
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:01,660
hit this is made and created using a new version of soundbites. Oh, it's a three duck

325
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:09,260
seven and it has the new features implemented that were put in the better version I was using.

326
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:15,740
So check it out. All right. If you want to buy these tracks so you can hear more of them

329
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:33,180
Have fun and remember try to think with your heart. Bye bye. Bye back to test that she

330
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,340
mail.com info.

331
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,140
Oh, man, just hearing all that being in New York makes me think of so many good times

332
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,420
particularly those songs Billy Idol, man. That was big when

333
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,380
just about the time when I was over here

334
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,420
kicking at MTV

335
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,420
and to be

336
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:03,420
in New York and then here a day Fox there that fantastic voice who does the ending of the

337
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,500
of the of the hit test imaging

338
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:13,900
but all day working at Z100 in New York hopefully able to hook up with him this week because I'm going to be here all week

339
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,860
leave Friday night. I'm going to see if I can miss you my good buddy Steve leads over it to

340
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,500
serious. So actually serious XM these days

341
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:28,060
wonder how that's going over there, man. Those guys are losing like a billion dollars a year.

342
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,900
Literally. I mean, look it up. A billion dollars combined

343
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:39,900
serious net XM and their stock prices like a 20 cents completely destroyed by the FCC or whoever

344
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,300
in the government was responsible for slowing down that merger.

345
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,580
And I got to check out the new version of Soundbike.

346
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:53,020
You know, I I used live able to live for the most of the production of the of the daily source code

347
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:59,020
but I do use soundbite as kind of like a cart rack and I got to go check out what those new features are.

348
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,540
I do recall that popping up saying, hey, yeah, there's new version available.

349
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:07,420
Do you want to get that? And I think at the time it's like new too busy. Not going to I like it when they ask

350
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:14,940
a speaking of updates, by the way, the the Google G1 Google phone that I have, which I brought with

351
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:21,740
me to the States, seeing as it has my U.S. SIM card embedded. And so I can make and receive

352
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,780
cheaper phone calls here. Of course, this thing runs out of battery and about two and a half hours now.

353
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,180
Something that is very cool about the phone twice now. I've received an update

354
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,780
where you you turn on the phone and it's say, hey, there's an update available and you say,

355
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,500
yeah, I'll take it now and then it literally downloads the update right there on the phone,

356
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:45,660
which is what I guess most people would wish their iPhone did. You don't have to be tethered. It's

357
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:56,140
pretty cool. Still quite useless as a phone. Really messed up news from the lowlands. This really

358
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:04,140
cuts down to the core of who I am and and and and my roots and where I come from. A lot of articles

359
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:14,220
coming out now that by 2010, the current ruling Christian Democrats have said, you know what,

360
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,980
it's over and done with. We got to get rid of all these coffee shops in the Netherlands.

361
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:25,100
Now, if you don't know what a coffee shop is in Holland, at least it's not where you go to buy coffee.

362
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,980
It is where you go to buy weed and it's kind of a weird situation because although it's legal to buy

363
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:38,700
and legal to smoke, it's illegal to supply to the coffee shops. But of course, that's that's

364
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:45,340
it's just being allowed. There must be, what's the word? I know the word in Dutch. I don't

365
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:52,540
know the word in English. It just remember that. It's a dog which means basically they kind of

366
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:57,980
look the other way. And as far as I know the policy's been pretty good, you know, it's to work

367
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,900
out well for decades. But now they're saying stop, not going to happen. The thing that really

368
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:13,580
interests me is that in the current coalition in the Netherlands, the Labor Party is also rules

369
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:19,660
with the Christian Democrats. And the guy that I know for almost 10 remons who is the Secretary of

370
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:25,340
State for Economic Affairs, or is it European affairs? I think it's economic affairs.

371
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,620
He's come out and said, hey, you know, I don't think that's such a good idea. We go,

372
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,020
you shut up, you a Christian Democrats. And he has told me this personally before,

373
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:42,620
by the way, France Timberlons, he's a builder-berg group member, total member of the New World Order,

374
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:50,780
Illuminati, nice guy, just because he's involved with all that doesn't mean that his personality

375
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,260
at the surface, at least is a nice. And he said a couple things to me in passing,

376
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:03,580
which, particularly when I was doing the Dutch radio show at Arrow Classic Rock, I had him on,

377
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:08,060
how do I actually have him in the studio? I remember him saying, you guys are doing some really

378
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:13,500
important stuff here. I think that this is one of those guys who he's wrapped up in it all.

379
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,700
He doesn't see a way out, but he does actually know that what is happening is wrong.

380
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,140
Or maybe he's just thinking, hey, this is a big part of our economy. We don't want to blow that up.

381
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:31,420
I don't know, one way or the other, but it's sad that this noise is now taking place. We've been

382
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:36,460
hearing these rumblings for many, many years and it looks like it actually might happen.

383
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:42,460
It is a fact now that you cannot sell your coffee shop. If you sell it, it can no longer be a coffee shop.

384
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:48,140
There's only about 150 left in all of Holland. Most of them, I believe, probably in

385
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:56,460
and around Amsterdam. I'm keeping my eye on the situation, but I'm obviously quite sad about

386
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:02,060
what's taking place. Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, this is a great story. I mentioned this

387
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:08,940
on Noah Gendo over the weekend talking to John Jackie Smith, the home secretary. She's in charge of

388
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:14,940
everything that goes on in home. In the UK, and she says, hey, you know, we're going to have national

389
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:21,660
ID cards for everybody, which is basically the precursor to the chip in your head, biometric data

390
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:27,980
on the ID cards by 2012. But, quote, I regularly have people coming up to me saying, they don't want

391
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:33,660
to wait that long. They can't wait. They love the idea of the ID card. They really, really love it.

392
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:43,500
What a lie. What a crock. They're really, really pushing this stuff. And in the meantime,

393
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:51,900
we have all this change taking place based upon our hope. And we have lots to look forward to as

394
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:00,540
the soul member of the office of the president elect. President elect Obama will be coming. And

395
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:05,420
right now, we've just got this big reality show taken place on television. We're all looking there

396
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:10,860
at the wrong things and all this shit is happening. Lickety split. They're going to, the banks are

397
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:16,940
basically going to run the world. That's the way I see it. We're all going to have ID cards. The

398
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:23,820
internet is being censored from Australia. Well, obviously China, but Australia is really taking place

399
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:30,380
now that United Kingdom, it's unstoppable. You know, why? Because we're sheep. And we're just

400
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:38,220
letting it happen. Just staying in the Netherlands for one moment. And also just staying with the

401
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:45,500
radio show. You know, one of the big problems that started off the demise of your wake-up call,

402
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,780
which was the show I was doing on the in the mornings for Holland. Only did it for like three and a

403
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:59,180
half months. Is when I got a reporter on who has been following the case of the Secretary

404
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:05,100
General, George Demink, the Secretary General of the Netherlands. That's just about the highest position

405
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:13,180
you can have in the Justice Department. He is pretty much the bomb digger. He's not the minister of

406
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,660
of the Justice System, but he's the Secretary General. These are the guys that really do most of the work.

407
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:29,580
A well-known and documented pedo-sexual, not a pedophile, although he's that as well, but he's a

408
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:37,980
pedo-sexual, meaning he has had and probably still has sex with children. Now, in this case,

409
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:44,140
15-year-old boys, it's well-documented, multiple television shows, have tried to

410
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:53,260
have tried to blow this case wide open. They keep getting shut down. This particular reporter, Mikha

411
00:30:53,340 --> 00:31:01,180
cult, he actually is now operating from Thailand, because his life is in danger, because he keeps

412
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:06,860
on howling this guy. It's not just this guy. I just, and I'm bringing this up because A, this

413
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:11,020
was part of the demise of not just my show, but I believe now the whole station is in trouble,

414
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:17,580
the government is trying to take him down. But this just shows you how deep this shit goes.

415
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:26,700
There is such a huge pedophile network in the Netherlands, and it spreads. It spreads from the

416
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:35,340
Netherlands to, if you haven't never heard of the due true case, D U T R O U X, the X files. You can Google

417
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:41,340
all of this stuff. I'm not going to put links in the show notes. That's, believe me, it's two

418
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:47,660
dangers, just for even for me to be doing that, because it stirs up so much shit. These guys have

419
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:54,860
been locking down any complaint, any news article, anything that's come out about this case,

420
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:59,660
and many, many more. I personally believe that the Isle of Jersey is connected to it. Remember,

421
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,980
we don't hear about that anymore, of course. Remember, the bunker next to the orphanage, where they

422
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:13,340
found, was it bones and teeth of tens of, it may be 20, 30, 40 kids who had been sexually abused

423
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:23,740
and killed, and just left to rot. I'm pretty sure that Madeline McCain, I'm sorry, Madeline

424
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:36,060
McCain. That whole situation is part of this network. There's lots of testimony and to some

425
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:42,940
degree evidence that the former heads of the Fortess Bank were involved in these networks,

426
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:52,140
royalty, Belgian royalty, Dutch royalty, British royalty. It's a true network of degenerate crazy

427
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,380
freaks, and they're running the justice system. Man, I'm happy I'm New York,

428
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:02,380
while I'm talking about all this crap. So I put a link to a hive site, which does nothing for you,

429
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,580
if you unless you speak Dutch, but I just wanted to bring it to your attention. First of all,

430
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,780
we have a lot of listeners and the Netherlands tuning in. We have to continue to spread this

431
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:17,100
information to get it out far and wide, because once we crack this nut, I believe these networks

432
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:23,980
these crazy ass nut jobs actually will go all the way to the White House. Many, many, many

433
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:33,340
documentaries, articles, and I'm just going to leave it at this, but it just, it makes me so mad

434
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:42,060
when I see that these guys are getting away with horrible, horrible things, and they are the

435
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:49,900
justice system. They literally run it, and they can do whatever they want, and they are.

436
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:59,340
Makes me, you know, it just makes me, it makes me angry, makes me sad, at the same time,

437
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:06,380
I'm really happy that we have alternative, distribution, alternative media where we can get the word out.

438
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:12,540
And we can talk about the nut jobs who are going to run our lives, run our monies, run our

439
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:21,980
governments, and get away with literally murder. They all want to root of the world, nothing new there.

440
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:36,940
We will want to run our lives, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our mon

441
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:36,380
moving our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, oh my ком 축 structure and darkness have to begin the monies, and lost our own monies, run our monies, run our monies, run our monies, no monies,

friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends , friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends

445
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:42,380
I had really such a shame those guys wasn't to curtain roll and never got their shit together

446
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,380
I'm trying to get one of the other albums, it's never worked up, they broke out

447
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,380
Tears of fears everybody wants to rule the world, ain't that the truth

448
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,380
Ain't that the truth

449
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,380
I just feel really bad you know, it's like

450
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,380
The radio station couldn't really help it, you know, they knew what I was going to do

451
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,380
I knew what I was going to do

452
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,380
And just maybe I took it a bit too far, but I just couldn't stand it

453
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,380
I just couldn't stand what was going on

454
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,380
And so now looks like the government is going to take down the entire station

455
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,380
So there you go

456
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,380
Let's get back into the markets

457
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,380
In this case not the true financial market, but this would be the carbon credit market

458
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,380
Which is crashing down

459
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:35,380
I love this, the whole idea of what I wrote, I think I had someone wrote it on the source code drop

460
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,380
That buying carbon credits to fight

461
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,380
Global warming or climate change or whatever you want to call it

462
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,380
It's kind of like being fat and paying skinny person

463
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,380
To help you slim down

464
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,380
You know, it's like it's just so you understand how these carbon credits work

465
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,380
If you have a factory

466
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,380
And you want to produce stuff

467
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,380
The CO2, remember that's the stuff that you exhale

468
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,380
But it also comes out of chimneys

469
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,380
It's a lot of other shit that comes out of chimneys, which is definitely not good

470
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:16,380
The CO2 in that so harmful in my opinion, but let's not get into that

471
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,380
You basically got to pay for it, which means that somewhere down the line in the future

472
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:28,380
Someone who sold that carbon credit will have to produce less

473
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,380
Less carbon, so it's really it's not solving anything

474
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,380
It's just moving the future further and you know, moving the problem further out into the future

475
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,380
You know, into like my daughter's era

476
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,380
Once you'll be grown up and then you'll have to deal with it

477
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,380
That's kind of what the idea is in my humble opinion

478
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:54,380
In July, one ton of CO2 would have cost 29 euros and 33 cents just the other day

479
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,380
It was down to 1825

480
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:04,380
Sudden collapse of carbon price mirrors the route in wider commodity markets, no kidding

481
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,380
So that market may just go away, it's crazy

482
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,380
Trading on carbon credits

483
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,380
Whole thing is BS

484
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,380
Total BS

485
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,380
Hey Adam, it's market snowball here

486
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:26,380
I've been listening to a lot of stuff you've been saying about this whole like carbon tax and carbon credits thing

487
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,380
And I just want to agree with you that it's bullshit

488
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,380
Oh good

489
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:38,380
You know, this whole idea that you're going to convince people to do something by finding them basically

490
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,380
Yeah, that's the idea

491
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,380
And it's not, now it's for factories and industry

492
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:51,380
But you know, we're already being conditioned to look at our own carbon footprint

493
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,380
And that's the future I see, that's what I see coming with the

494
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,380
The greening of the economy

495
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,380
Is it just lots of stuff you won't be able to do?

496
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,380
You want to do something you have to buy some carbon credits

497
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,380
Tax basically

498
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,380
Extras special taxes

499
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,380
Pay in more money to do stuff we've been doing forever

500
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:17,380
You know, I'm pretty sure I want to compare it to basically speeding tickets

501
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:23,380
And if I remember right, you had a lovely experience with that sort of thing

502
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:30,380
Actually, that was the lady Patricia who has a heavy, heavy foot on the accelerator

503
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,380
But I took the rap for twice, I took the rap, I got the points

504
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,380
I said, I take it, baby, don't worry about it, I'll take it for you

505
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:43,380
A while back, like I said, it was a while ago, so I'm not sure if I remember right now

506
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,380
Oh yeah, no, believe me, she's learned since then

507
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:50,380
This whole thing, well it's hard to see what 30 miles an hour is on my spedometer

508
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,380
I couldn't tell, yeah, of course she really was only going 32

509
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,380
And then she gets snapped the photograph

510
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,380
Nothing dangerous about what she was doing

511
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,380
Just the way to get money

512
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,380
As like a 65 pounds per shot, something like that

513
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:14,380
Exactly, but supposedly the idea, of course, behind getting tickets for committing

514
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:19,380
Moving violations while in your car is that this supposedly a deterrent

515
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,380
But it really isn't

516
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,380
Oh, it's a game

517
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:27,380
It's pretty much all these tickets do is basically give more money to the police departments

518
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,380
You know, if they need more money, they've got us where they can get out

519
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:36,380
And the hassling people who are going five miles over the speed, I'm sure

520
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:40,380
Anyway, just wanted to throw in my two cents about that

521
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:46,380
Great hair, hope you in, love you no homo

522
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:51,380
And of course, and they work for us

523
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:55,380
Yeah, they really should, but they don't, they work for the banks

524
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,380
They'll work for the banks right now

525
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,380
We're working for the banks

526
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,380
Oh boy, let's see, Chris from Nashville

527
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,380
You know, actually, I did want to say

528
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,380
But I'm going to stick to my guns on this stuff

529
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,380
Okay, I'm going to stick to my guns about

530
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:18,380
It's irrelevant, it's just not, it's not productive for us to have a conversation

531
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,380
about whether global warming or climate change exists

532
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,380
Or not, one thing is absolutely 100% clear to me

533
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,380
The entire world is based upon oil

534
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,380
Well, actually, based upon oil, golden drugs

535
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:38,380
Those are the true commodities, the true currencies that make the economies run

536
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,380
And everything comes from energy

537
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,380
We have to have energy

538
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,380
And can you just imagine

539
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,380
If there was a way

540
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:51,380
You could wave a magic wand or rub your hands together

541
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,380
Or snap your fingers and you could basically produce energy

542
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:59,380
Energy to, well, to provide you with transportation

543
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,380
Energy to heat your home

544
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,380
Energy to make stuff

545
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,380
Because, you know, really make and stuff

546
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,380
You need energy, you need either tremendous heat for steel

547
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,380
Or, you know, other forms of energy to manipulate

548
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,380
Other types of materials

549
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,380
Imagine if, if you didn't have to buy that

550
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,380
Imagine if you didn't have to come off of the grid

551
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,380
Or if had to come out of, you know, some global system

552
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,380
Where it comes out of the ground

553
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:30,380
And then is, is processed and is finally comes to you

554
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,380
And the form of gasoline or diesel

555
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,380
Or other forms of petroleum

556
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,380
Imagine if we have that

557
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,380
Imagine if there truly was

558
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:43,380
A form of energy that everyone had access to

559
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,380
First of all, if I knew about this

560
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,380
Unless you say maybe I knew about it a hundred years ago

561
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,380
Because Tesla probably invented it and it was suppressed

562
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,380
You would keep that shit quiet

563
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,380
You would keep people dumb as long as possible

564
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,380
Because the true power comes from harnessing

565
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,380
The energy

566
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,380
From having control over the energy

567
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,380
That's really where all the power comes from

568
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,380
So I am going to re-dedicate myself

569
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,380
It already started with the hydroxy booster

570
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:14,380
In the jag, which is still to this day is getting

571
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,380
Since I had that thing built into the car

572
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,380
Just yesterday before I left

573
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,380
It's only the third time I filled up the gas tank

574
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,380
The third time in what?

575
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,380
Four months now or something like that

576
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:29,380
It's outrageous how much gas this is saving me

577
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,380
Just by putting a little bit of science to work

578
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,380
And you can, people out there who said, oh, this is not possible

579
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,380
And you can't get more energy

580
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:41,380
And this is against the law of physics fine

581
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,380
All I know is I have empirical proof for myself

582
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,380
It works

583
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,380
I put less gas in my car

584
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,380
It's about to the averages 29%

585
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,380
Depends on where I'm driving, how I'm driving

586
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,380
Anywhere between 25 and 30%

587
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,380
Less gas goes into my car

588
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,380
Because of this basically

589
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,380
He's a plastic with water and electricity

590
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,380
From the battery that I have

591
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,380
Jacked under the hood

592
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,380
Thing works

593
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,380
And you can go ahead and look around online

594
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,380
And I actually put a link in the show notes about

595
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,380
Another crazy thing that's been happening down under

596
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,380
The Australians, I don't know

597
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,380
And they seem to be coming up with more and more cool shit

598
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,380
Where you put like

599
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,380
One volt in and ten volts comes out

600
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,380
Yeah, they say it's impossible

601
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,380
But they're doing it with magnets

602
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,380
And all kinds of crazy stuff

603
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,380
I'm really dedicated myself

604
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,380
Which means I'll have to go and visit more and more

605
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,380
These new age sciences

606
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,380
So we're discovering this stuff

607
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,380
And making it and actually coming up with results

608
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,380
And we have to get this stuff out to the people

609
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,380
If it's actually viable, if it works

610
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,380
And that's what I'm going to stick to

611
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,380
That's what I'm going to stay right on top of

612
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,380
Instead of because we know what

613
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,380
We'll solve my issues

614
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,380
And we'll solve your issues

615
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,380
If we don't have to burn fossil fuels

616
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,380
Then everybody should be happy

617
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,380
Right?

618
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,380
Because by the way, your government

619
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,380
Is not looking into the true alternatives

620
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,380
They don't seem to be clamoring all over people

621
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,380
Who are coming up without rages

622
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,380
Or seemingly outrageous claims

623
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,380
You don't see them

624
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,380
Yeah, actually you do

625
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,380
You see them going up to these inventors

626
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,380
And killing them

627
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,380
I'm a Christian Nashville again

628
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,380
First of all, it's a thank you for playing

629
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,380
The comment on 802

630
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,380
Oh man, I don't know

631
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,380
Thank you for contributing

632
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,380
You guys put the show together

633
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,380
I mean, all I do is spend a couple of hours

634
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,380
Pulling stuff off the drop

635
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,380
And then I got a show

636
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,380
And I agree

637
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,380
We shouldn't argue about a bigger

638
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,380
About all this stuff

639
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,380
I just wanted to also just add that

640
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:42,380
I agree with you as well

641
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,380
I mean, carbon credits, this whole scam

642
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,380
Or whatever

643
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,380
It's not the best way forward

644
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,380
Which I'm pretty sure is set up by Al Gore

645
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,380
By the way

646
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,380
I don't know if he's in all the carbon credit

647
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,380
Trading schemes

648
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,380
But I know he has a lot to do with it

649
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,380
The best way forward is to look

650
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,380
Different forms of energy

651
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,380
I agree with you

652
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,380
You know, this whole triangle hold

653
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,380
That they have on the oil industry

654
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,380
And so on

655
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,380
I think that's definitely the way forward

656
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,380
A great counter to the whole

657
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,380
Drill baby drill

658
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,380
Or whatever

659
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,380
I mean, how not lets invent something

660
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,380
It says drill

661
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,380
It's insane

662
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,380
Really

663
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,380
And you know, just wanted to throw that out there

664
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,380
Let's not argue about it

665
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,380
You know, we're obviously going to be working on it

666
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,380
Obviously disagree on it

667
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,380
So I just wanted to leave a follow up

668
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,380
To that comment

669
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,380
Still love the show

670
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,380
Love you a minute

671
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,380
And right here in Houghtyland

672
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,380
And we'll talk to you later

673
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,380
Thanks man

674
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,380
Thanks Chris

675
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,380
I'm not going to make it too much longer

676
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,380
For today I'm going to try

677
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,380
And since I will have a couple of evenings

678
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,380
Fring and I'm going to see if I'm going to do

679
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,380
More than one show this week

680
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,380
What do we got right now

681
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,380
We're at feels like about 40 minutes

682
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,380
What do we got?

683
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,380
Oh geez

684
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,380
Man, time flies when you're having fun with friends

685
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,380
48 minutes already

686
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,380
So in the I'm not going to play the YouTube video

687
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,380
But I did put a link in the show notes

688
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,380
DaddySourceCo.com or crossposts

689
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,380
That are curry.com

690
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,380
The Lutec Magnetic Amplifier

691
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,380
Which is yet another

692
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,380
As I said, another crazy Australian invention

693
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,380
These guys are making stuff

694
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,380
They put 210 volts in

695
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,380
Like five times the energy comes out

696
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:20,380
I mean, can you imagine you could run your entire home on that?

697
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,380
Oh man, it'll be so beautiful

698
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,380
You know what?

699
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,380
I got to go to Australia

700
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,380
That's it

701
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,380
It's settled

702
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,380
Okay

703
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,380
This is a trip that I this is now

704
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,380
I finally have a real besides

705
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,380
Well, we know that I'm not going for the porn

706
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,380
Down Under

707
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,380
Because the links that have been showing up on the

708
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,380
Drop are of very low

709
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,380
Excitement

710
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,380
Quality

711
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,380
There's not a lot of good porn going on down under

712
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,380
I have been to Australia before

713
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,380
I love the people

714
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,380
Love the place

715
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,380
Work hard, play hard

716
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,380
I need to go visit some of these folks

717
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:55,380
Maybe that's a whole series

718
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,380
I don't know

719
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,380
But I am going to make time in 2009

720
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:00,380
Hear me now

721
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,380
Believe me later my friends

722
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,380
I'm going to come to Australia

723
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,380
And I'd like you to start helping me out

724
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,380
I need to map out

725
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,380
Where I need to go to

726
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,380
Obviously it's a huge country

727
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,380
I can't go everywhere

728
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,380
But I do want to visit some of these folks

729
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,380
I'm not quite sure where they're all located

730
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:21,380
But I just got to go and see some of this for myself

731
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,380
And we've got to bring this to the forefront

732
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,380
There are some truly spectacular stuff going on

733
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:31,380
Meanwhile, just going back to something that

734
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,380
Totally insulted me, made me incredibly angry

735
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,380
From the Washington Post

736
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,380
Airports across the country

737
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,380
Will have designated security lanes for families

738
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,380
To move through pre-flight inspections at their own pace

739
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,380
Just in time for the busy Thanksgiving

740
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,380
Travel season reports the Washington Post

741
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:54,380
And so essentially you'll get the experienced lane

742
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,380
That would be people like me

743
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,380
You just want to zip through and know by the time you get there

744
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,380
You've got your laptop, you've got your belt off

745
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,380
You've got all your shit and your jacket

746
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,380
Your jackets and the tray

747
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,380
I got my shoes off because of course

748
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,380
The expensive shoes are the ones that have the metal

749
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,380
And it turns out

750
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,380
That's what they always say

751
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,380
Take off your shoes

752
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,380
They're too expensive

753
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,380
They've got metal in them

754
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,380
Crazy

755
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,380
Expanding these lanes

756
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,380
Every airport and directing families and passengers

757
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:20,380
With medical necessary liquids

758
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:23,380
To them increases passenger convenience and security

759
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,380
And here it comes, here's the thing that pisses me off

760
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:30,380
In August of 2006, the TSA changed its screening policies

761
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,380
After officials foiled a plot to use liquid explosives

762
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:38,380
To blow up commercial airlines headed towards the US intelligence

763
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,380
Well, I'm sorry towards the US

764
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,380
Intelligence officials remain concerned

765
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:47,380
The terrorists could carry liquid explosives onto the plane

766
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,380
And of course the government is testing equipment

767
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,380
That scans liquids for explosives

768
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,380
And hopes to lift the restrictions in the future

769
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:57,380
So I just want to remind you that the British courts

770
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,380
Could not convict them of doing this

771
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,380
There was absolutely no, it's a story

772
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:07,380
It's a fabel, it's fake, it's bullshit, it's a lie

773
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,380
They could not convict

774
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,380
These so-called terrorists

775
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,380
For actually plotting to do that

776
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,380
They had no tickets, they had no passports

777
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,380
There was absolutely no indication

778
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,380
They were going to blow up airplanes

779
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,380
And yet the stupid laws still remain in place

780
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,380
We're still taking our shoes off

781
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,380
Because of some guy who had

782
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:29,380
Like some kind of explosive in his shoe

783
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,380
And I love foiling

784
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,380
Once again, this morning at Heathrow

785
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,380
I love doing this

786
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,380
If you've ever flown international out of Heathrow

787
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,380
First you go through the regular screening

788
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:43,380
And then there's a secondary set of paths

789
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,380
We have to have your passport looked at

790
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,380
As you leave the country

791
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,380
Right after that

792
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,380
There's another security checkpoint

793
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,380
That is only for shoes

794
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,380
And you have to take your shoes off

795
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,380
Put them through and then go put your shoes on

796
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,380
And then you're finally out by the way

797
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,380
They drop your right off in the tax-free shopping

798
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,380
I mean literally inside the store

799
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,380
How convenient is that

800
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,380
But every single time I love doing this

801
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,380
I go through the passport

802
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,380
I always go to the right hand side

803
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:13,380
If you're traveling out of Heathrow

804
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,380
Try this

805
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,380
I go to the right hand side

806
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,380
The most far right passport control

807
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,380
And then as I come out

808
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,380
There's always the person trying to hurt the sheep

809
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,380
The sheep people into taking their shoes off

810
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,380
And I always kind of stand

811
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,380
I look at my passport fumbling

812
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,380
I might do something with my bag

813
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,380
And then the minute the security person is not looking

814
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,380
I just walk right past on the right hand side

815
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,380
There's so-called security checkpoint

816
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,380
Proving that that is bullshit as well

817
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,380
Because they don't mean it

818
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,380
They really don't

819
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,380
One thing that has been cropping up that

820
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,380
God I hope this is not true

821
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,380
But as you know

822
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,380
911 and 777

823
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,380
911 of course in the United States

824
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,380
On the day of 911

825
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,380
There was an actual drill taking place

826
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,380
A drill that

827
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,380
An exercise

828
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:07,380
Military actually was a lot of different divisions were involved

829
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,380
The delts specifically with hijacked planes

830
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,380
They were doing a drill

831
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,380
And it happened for real

832
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,380
July 7th

833
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,380
In the United Kingdom

834
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:23,380
At that very same time

835
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,380
They were doing a drill

836
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,380
A security drill in London

837
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:31,380
Where they suppose that there would be a number of explosions

838
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,380
In tubes

839
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,380
That's the subway

840
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:41,380
And buses and they were almost exactly the same spots where these explosions took place

841
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:45,380
You can call it coincidence or whatever

842
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,380
But starting tomorrow in Los Angeles, California

843
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,380
5 million people will be subject to the Los Angeles

844
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,380
Shaken-Bake drill as I'm calling it

845
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:59,380
They're going to simulate a 7.3 or 7.5 magnitude

846
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,380
Earthquake on the Richter scale

847
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:05,380
I think this last for three or four days this drill

848
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:09,380
And of course this stuff popping up on the internet

849
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,380
Everywhere's in people saying hey, wait a minute

850
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,380
911 that had a drill it really happened

851
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,380
777 in London

852
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,380
They had a drill it really happened

853
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:23,380
My buddy John C. Devorex said that he thought that the cycle was time once again for a so-called

854
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:27,380
Terrorist attack and he was talking about Los Angeles

855
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:31,380
I don't see how we can quite corroborate

856
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:35,380
Or combine the an earthquake with a terrorist attack

857
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,380
But I'm just saying

858
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,380
So if it does happen, God forbid man

859
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,380
I got too many friends in Los Angeles, God forbid

860
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,380
At least we'll know that there's a pattern to this stuff

861
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,380
So let's hope it doesn't happen

862
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,380
Then finally

863
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:55,380
What company is doing great in these times?

864
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,380
What company do you think is just doing a fan?

865
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,380
Just knocking it out of the park

866
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,380
When everyone's in trouble, everyone's going crazy

867
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,380
Everyone's losing money, the markets are crashing

868
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,380
McDonald's

869
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:11,380
8.2% up

870
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,380
In actual revenue

871
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,380
Because of course

872
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,380
With food is too expensive

873
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,380
We're starving, we're eating crap

874
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,380
Absolute crap

875
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,380
Same store sales

876
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,380
Same store sales, 8.2%

877
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,380
And how do you like this?

878
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:33,380
The company's popular dollar menu

879
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,380
And its annual monopoly promotion

880
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,380
Also drew in value hungry customers

881
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:43,380
How interesting is that that we've been talking about

882
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:47,380
The move from paper to plastic egg McDonald's

883
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,380
As well as in the monopoly game

884
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,380
It's just making it easy

885
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,380
Path of least resistance people

886
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,380
Please

887
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,380
Try and eat something healthy

888
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:01,380
I know it's really outrageously expensive

889
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,380
But this is how we really are killing ourselves

890
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,380
By eating absolute crap

891
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:09,380
We've really really really really got to take care of ourselves

892
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:13,380
And I'm going to do just that

893
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:17,380
Which means let's see it's a nine o'clock here in New York

894
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,380
So my body clock is saying 2 a.m

895
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,380
Time for me to head off to bed

896
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,380
After we hear from the master John Lennon

897
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,380
As soon as you're born

898
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,380
They make it feel small

899
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:35,380
By giving you no time instead of at all

900
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:43,380
Till a pain is so big you feel nothing at all

901
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:51,380
Working class hero is something to be

902
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,380
Working class hero is something to be

903
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,380
They hurt you at home

904
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,380
They did do it school

905
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:13,380
They hate you if you're clever

906
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,380
And they despise a fool

907
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,380
Till you're so fucking crazy

908
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,380
You can't follow their rules

909
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:31,380
Working class hero is something to be

910
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:37,380
Working class hero is something to be

911
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,380
When the tortured and scared you for 20 odd years

912
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:55,380
Then they expect you to pick a career

913
00:58:55,380 --> 00:59:03,380
When you can't really function you're so full of fear

914
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:09,380
Working class hero is something to be

915
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:17,380
Working class hero is something to be

916
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:23,380
Keep it dope with religion

917
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,380
Sex and TV

918
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:33,380
And you think you're so clever and class-less and free

919
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:41,380
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see

920
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:49,380
Working class hero is something to be

921
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:57,380
Working class hero is something to be

922
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:05,380
There's room at the top they are telling you still

923
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:13,380
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill

924
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:21,380
If you want to be like the folks on the hill

925
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:29,380
Working class hero is something to be

926
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:37,380
Working class hero is something to be

927
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:43,380
If you want to be hero

928
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,380
Just follow me

929
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:51,380
If you want to be hero

930
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:53,380
Just follow me

931
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:57,380
I'm not the only one saying this shit has been going on for a long time

932
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,380
A lot of people have been switched on to this

933
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:03,380
And we must not forget

934
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:09,380
As I said, lots going on this week in Nueva York

935
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:11,380
Good to be in the city though

936
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:15,380
It still is the city that makes me feel very much at home

937
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:19,380
I haven't really been able to taste the atmosphere yet

938
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,380
So tomorrow I'll get a good dose of it

939
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:25,380
And I'll probably be in a New York state of mind which is always fun to be in

940
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,380
So take everybody remember

941
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:29,380
It's your freedom

942
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,380
Enjoy it while you can

943
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:33,380
Use it responsibly

944
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,380
And whatever you do

945
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:37,380
Live your life with passion
