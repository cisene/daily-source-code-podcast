137
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,440
once again to roll out daily source code, lots of stuff happen in apologies for kind of a

138
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,240
confused because I did, I did the show Monday night and I carried over into Tuesday of course

139
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,680
that would be a Friday for those of you living in Australia and I wanted to do a show

140
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,960
yesterday and I just came home last actually I had dinner with John Devourack. You know this is my

141
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:11,240
eating buddy and so we went to it's it's crazy I'll tell you something. We'll probably talk about it

142
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,320
on Friday. We said yeah actually we're walking out of the office together and I said hey man

143
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,880
are you alone here because his wife is up in Seattle and his family is up there during the week.

144
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,000
He said yeah yeah so well have you eaten and let's go eat together so okay so we did actually

145
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,720
pre-plan this time and so we're driving and he says let's go to our place and I was like

146
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,440
holy crap that's kind of scary. We have a place together I don't know if I liked that.

147
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:47,160
So I was good and we had a real nice talk all kind of in preparation for cranky geeks which was

148
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,520
tape today it's also a stream's live and I thought it was pretty good show actually I enjoyed

149
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:02,120
myself thoroughly actually what was interesting is the comments already they were like 20 or 25 comments

150
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,560
for the episode and somehow people picked up on you know they think there was some tension

151
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:15,000
between Leo Leport Leo Leport the chief twit was also on the show with Sebastian Roopley who

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,560
of course is the shill of the show and a lot of people thought that the Leo and I didn't get

153
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,760
a long and I was like and I read the comments before I viewed the show and then I just looked

154
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:32,600
at the whole show and I can see and this is how interesting first of all you know we're on the

155
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,120
show to entertain right so you want to have some kind of fire and some kind of sparks and

156
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:45,800
one stuff going but there was this one segment where I think just because you know they cut

157
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:53,160
one camera to me one camera to Leo and just the way it looked and on quite honestly the way I was

158
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:59,400
looking I think that you could misconstru that as perhaps some kind of bad vibe but nothing could

159
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:06,360
be further from the truth we love and respect each other and I one day I hope to have a place to go

160
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,760
eat with Leo wouldn't that be lovely not be just fantastic once again we're on the on the live set

161
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:18,760
up on the live system so this means that I've got my new my new setup completely in place which

162
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:25,640
I'm quite happy with I really loved in fact he does sent me a note he's pretty much he's pretty much

163
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,680
my my thermometer when it comes to the sound and how everything's working and if the levels are

164
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,880
right on and he's got a great set of ears on his head and he gave me some kudos he said it was

165
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,880
it was pretty much spot on so it was very happy with that all of the crackling and all that crap is

166
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,080
gone and this funny because I showed John DeVore how my setup worked and he said that I have a

167
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,200
patentable process he says you can write a patent for this and I like I don't want to write no

168
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,440
damn patent I got the time for that crap he said no you know what I'll write the patent we'll share it

169
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,760
it's okay don't deal let's share this patent I love it hey by the way those of you who have called

170
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,040
into talk show please don't send me messages on Skype okay if you want to participate in the show

171
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,520
and if you if you have something to say about one of the topics then all I'd like you to do is just

172
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,160
kind of raise your hand and and let me know if you want to come in on one of the topics what you

173
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:27,800
have to do is you have to call into the talk show system so a lot of you I can see there's tons

174
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,320
of people here right now who are just listening in which is cool not a problem welcome to it but

175
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,240
if you want to say something you got to call in so I follow the instructions you have to call

176
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:44,600
in you to pin number etc so and if you want to chime in on a topic then just type it into the

177
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,560
chat room say hey I want to talk about something so for example if you want if you saw cranky geeks

178
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,680
and you want to say something about the show now would be a very appropriate time because I'm just

179
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,840
filling up this space waiting for someone to say yeah I got something to say so it's not happening

180
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,600
that's okay so that's how that's how it's going to work and of course we also have

181
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:18,040
are okay well okay TD enterprises saw cranky geeks TD

182
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,080
TD you there excellent that's exactly how I didn't want it to work

183
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,360
I don't think Skype works too well you got no sound okay good forget about it we're going to

184
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,720
move on to the first pre-taped call hey Adam it's Walt Snyder for a letter Dale I'm the one that

185
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:43,080
sent you the rubber glove intro that you use the what slide I think so anyway I noticed that

186
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:50,040
it really sounds like you could use the call stringer to make sure that these guys don't talk

187
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:58,360
yeah like this just a thought otherwise I like where you're going and maybe if you have a

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,320
some sort of schedule we can all show up at the right time and be there otherwise I really don't

189
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,120
know when to show up and be on pop shoe to talk with you all right well what's the show

190
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,240
of you mean it no homo great here and not smoking and there's my phone bye

191
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,840
oh my thanks well yeah of course I'd love to have a call screener but kind of the whole point

192
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,520
and this is part of the whole process is to be able to do it all myself to have basically a

193
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,120
pre-screened process which means you guys are in the chat room you're saying stuff and

194
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:38,440
and if I think it's interesting or if it's something that you know that belongs in the program

195
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,920
as a part of the topic then I'll just pull you right in obviously it would be great to be able to know

196
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:50,600
if someone actually has sound if they you know if they can to speak coherently but you know I

197
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,920
just don't have that set up of course we could have here's an idea oh man I just duh I just

198
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:02,840
came up with it why not um one of you guys be the screener because you're basically all sitting in there

199
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,880
you can all talk to each other right now I have everyone unmuted so we could have a call screener

200
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,960
in the in the chat room and you could send me separate messages through well through different

201
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,440
chat system even you could send me a private message to Skype and say okay you want to talk to

202
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,200
this guy he's got something good to say so this is something we all participated in we obviously

203
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,760
don't have it set up for today but let's work on that in the future let's get a couple of people

204
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:34,120
in the chat room and on the conference call who can do who can do some call screening and of course

205
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,240
is not just about people who are on the call it's about my savants around the world we love them so much

206
00:11:49,400 --> 00:12:13,960
comic strip no CSB come on in buddy this is really interesting and I do want to talk

207
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,280
about this I love that you know I I really wish we had some people who knew more about this

208
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:25,960
because cost of oh declared independence and you know now there's the the serves who hate the

209
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,680
I guess the former Bosnians it's very very confusing to me and it's all under this umbrella of

210
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,040
well of course we had a very bloody messy scenario over there not it in just a few years ago really

211
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,480
just recently lots of people died horrible horrible destruction of the countries there and all

212
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,960
within you know my plane could fly there and almost on one tank a gas you know so it ain't all that far

213
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,200
it would be nice to know what's really happening I have a feeling that this is about oil

214
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,280
and it's probably about pipelines running through different geographic regions and I'm sure Russia

215
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:10,200
has a lot to do with it and I just like to I'd just like to understand more so more on that CSB please

216
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:17,560
last week I was in Barcelona in doing myself which is located in Catalonia in Spain and on

217
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:27,000
on license plates in of course I have noticed a C-A-T cat and not E a Catalonia usual in Spain so both

218
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:37,080
Catalonia and Basque country regions in Spain wants to live Spain so no wonder that six EO countries

219
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:47,080
are not recognizing cassava so fuck whatever I like you I don't know you see I got some good news

220
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:59,240
for your comic strip blogger I had a chat today with the illustrious Andrew Grummit and I said hey dude

221
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:07,480
would you like to be a celebrity in Poland and he said I get laid I said yeah man absolutely all you

222
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:18,120
got to do all you all you got to do my friend is put an RSS feed into the pod show comments and

223
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,920
you will truly be the hero of comic strip blogger and all that is Polish and all who live in Germany in

224
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,320
one RSS feed for their comments

225
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,480
still lots of people confused about my problems entering the United States

226
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,560
I do not have a TSA problem yes they are part of the homeland security administration

227
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,840
but it is actually the guys with the guns who keep stopping me and give me secondary screenings

228
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:09,480
those who work for the customs and border patrol so I just want to say one more time because

229
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,600
questions like this although interesting aren't completely relevant you add I'm Christmas

230
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,360
town just heard your first live broadcast is pretty neat and that's right you didn't want to

231
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:26,200
question for you about the TSA what happens when you try to fly within the United States

232
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:32,360
like from a US location to a US location the others you get this empty and flag when you come

233
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,600
to customs but what happens if you fly it gets a date it'd be interesting to see if you're

234
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,880
any kind of list that way to see it so that's it is a very good question because I have

235
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,680
absolutely no problem as far as I know and I'm going to be flying to LA I think on Tuesday we've

236
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,600
got a couple meetings in the city of angels which I always look forward to I must say I do

237
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,760
enjoy visiting Los Angeles I'd hate to have to live there and so I don't think I'll have any

238
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,480
probably haven't had any previous problems with flying but if they're truly is and you know of

239
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,480
course now I have the information I know that there is an Adam Curry there looking for with his

240
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,800
birth date similar or exactly the same to mine as mine the evil Adam Curry as it were

241
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,080
you probably wouldn't want that guy flying domestically either so there I think there is a

242
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:25,160
disconnect between what the customs border protection agency is using as information and what

243
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:33,880
the TSA uses and of course they are the exact same department or they belong to the exact same

244
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:39,080
department so I'll let you know flying to Los Angeles I think it's Tuesday so we'll find out

245
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,360
if that works or not thank you all very much by the way for sending in links to what you

246
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,560
think might be the evil Adam Curry we did actually find let me just bring up the browser here

247
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,960
for a second boy do I miss my second screen I gotta get that set um here it is uh pop pop pop

248
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:02,360
um Eric Elliott one of the people who sent me this uh link you probably already started googling

249
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,520
and found out some info but I found this Adam Curry who lives in Colorado apparently went to

250
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:13,480
college in Nebraska I look at that guy he's at Adam Curry dot net and I don't think it's him there's

251
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:20,840
another guy that people found and I can't find the message off hand I know I saved it somewhere

252
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:26,520
and I gotta say he has a my space page I'll see if I can find the link and if I can't um someone

253
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:33,160
please post it in the comments um he looks like an evil dude his name his name is Adam Curry

254
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,720
it's from the braska he's got like a go-ty and uh and like a will-knit cap on his head and I can't

255
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,840
actually see his profile on my space because uh you have to friend him first and so he has a private

256
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:51,000
profile um so uh and of course it'd be kind of weird if uh if I show up you know with my my

257
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,160
spy my space profile which of course is Adam Curry and then all of us you know I just don't want

258
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,920
to do that so let's find that link and let's dig into this little bit deeper because this could

259
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,360
be the guy I mean if they're looking for an Adam Curry he looks about my age and he's from the braska

260
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:13,480
I mean come on this uh there's just no coincidence like that so uh I'd love uh I'd love some help

261
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,280
uh let me see yeah people asking for the link uh all right nothing quite going on I see Ranger

262
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:27,640
Craig has showed up in the audience that's good um yeah I got this promo I wanted to play for

263
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:35,720

00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,920
You just tell, just report back to the network that you played it.

308
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
At music.podshow.com.

309
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,920
So we got a pretty full chat room.

310
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,920
We got lots of people calling in.

311
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,920
And Captain Chris from the Plain Madness podcast.

312
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:54,920
You've got some info on the on the satellite that I guess we're going to shoot it out of the sky.

313
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Yeah, I'm reading it was about 1026 Eastern, which apparently is about an hour and 15 minutes hour.

314
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
So I meant to go outside.

315
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Yeah.

316
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,920
And it looks as though they hit it.

317
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,920
They're not sure if it took out the field tank.

318
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Yeah, I know that within about 24 hours.

319
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,920
But they're saying that stuff is supposed to start re-entering in the next one to two days.

320
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
That's pretty amazing.

321
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,920
How high up was this thing that they blew it out of the sky with a missile?

322
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,920
Do you know the actual altitude?

323
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,920
Well, I know it was going at about 17,000 miles per hour.

324
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,920
As far as how high it was, I think that's classified.

325
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
I don't know.

326
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:40,920
So that, you know, this is to me is much less about shooting a satellite out of the sky.

327
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,920
And more about, hey, hello, everyone in the world.

328
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,920
We can actually shoot your fucking shit out of the sky at any time we want to.

329
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
And it works.

330
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Yeah.

331
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,920
And you know, the Chinese are real tickled.

332
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Why?

333
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,920
Well, they were pretty, I'm excited about the whole thing.

334
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,920
If you gave it, however, they did the same thing with one of their own satellites.

335
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
Not too long ago.

336
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,920
And we got a little excited as well.

337
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,920
Now, I read somewhere, Chris, and you're an aviator.

338
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,920
I read somewhere that there was a, a no tan.

339
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,920
There were no tams about this saying, you know, don't fly.

340
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,920
Or maybe even they put up temporary restricted areas.

341
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Or there was a danger area put into place that you're not supposed to fly.

342
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,920
You could hit debris from the plank and to come down.

343
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Do you have any details on that?

344
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
Yeah.

345
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,920
I got to be able tonight from a buddy who was, was flying apparently.

346
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
And I, I can't remember.

347
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,920
Apparently there wasn't no tams for, for the Pacific Northwest.

348
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920
And I should just say, I'm sorry.

349
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,920
A no tan is an acronym for notice to airman.

350
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,920
And notoriously, we don't check these things because at the fuck.

351
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
You know, we're just going to fly.

352
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,920
But you really should because stuff like this comes up.

353
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,920
So I just want to explain the concept of a no tan.

354
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Yeah.

355
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,920
I see, I can find it as far as, or maybe somebody else is faster access to it than I do.

356
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,920
Apparently, maybe there was one, but it's not, it's not confirmed.

357
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,920
I think it was a NASA originated with NASA.

358
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,920
The no tan, which is, which is, yeah, which is kind of weird.

359
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,920
If you want to understand, well, again, I'm not, I got to figure it out.

360
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,920
Okay.

361
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
All right.

362
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,920
So, um, they're expecting if debris would come down to earth, then it would be in the next 24 hours.

363
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,920
24 48, according to the article that I'm looking at right now and everything else should be within the next 40 days.

364
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,920
However, they're anticipating that everything is going to burn up.

365
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
So it's right.

366
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,920
I know it's going to reach the ground.

367
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
Right. Because it's small pieces.

368
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,920
I also understand, though, that, you know, the real problem is all this debris that's floating around in space.

369
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:57,920
And if that hits you, even even a, like a, a quarter sized piece of debris.

370
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:03,920
If you hit that with your spacecraft, uh, that could cause a catastrophe.

371
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,920
Oh, yeah. You have a closer rates of everything in space with, you know, zero drag is, it's unbelievable.

372
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,920
So those, um, there was a, a meteor.

373
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,920
This is another deal that apparently, um, in the last day or two that heard about those a meteor that,

374
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,920
somewhere over Idaho, Montana, and a guy in a light GA aircraft spotted it.

375
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,920
And he spotted the impact as well.

376
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,920
Really?

377
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Yeah. Yeah. I just, I found out about this one today as well.

378
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,920
I, I should've got my, uh, my, uh, ducks in a row for the show here.

379
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
But, um, but you'll see, like, they get some more info on that.

380
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,920
They've got, apparently, it's like, five o'clock in the morning.

381
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
You guys put them on and it's sesame.

382
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,920
You see the thing and they actually see the hit the ground.

383
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:50,920
So the, uh, great escape is in the chat room says that, uh, the meteor hit, uh,

384
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Eastern Washington.

385
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,920
Yeah, that sounds about right.

386
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,920
Holy crap. So we don't have any reports on that. Yeah, I guess.

387
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,920
And he, anything else that, that, it hit something.

388
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,920
I'll see if you can find something on it.

389
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
All right, man. Thank you.

390
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
I, uh, I appreciate it.

391
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
And you're going to hang around for a while.

392
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,920
If you got anything else, just, uh, just hit me on the chat room and, uh,

393
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
I'll bring you in, okay?

394
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Who are you?

395
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Thank you.

396
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,920
All right, buddy. Thank you very much.

397
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,920
I had a nice child who was on London.

398
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,920
I can't be stood outside, uh,

399
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,920
point at MSI, the Astoria, which bet those in London's website.

400
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,920
By the way, this is Charles the, uh,

401
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,920
the Londoner formally known as Charles the drunken Londoner.

402
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,920
Uh, he's not drunk right now, which makes him a lot less funny,

403
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,920
but he's got a lot going on that is pretty smart.

404
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,920
On my way to, uh, go and do my directing day job.

405
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Uh, I've just been into, um,

406
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,920
you know what I don't know what episode.

407
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,920
It is. I'm grateful behind.

408
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,920
Uh, you worked for us.

409
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,920
I mean, you tell me where and when or you want me to get someone to design a

410
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,920
situation, we'll work out how to get him printed.

411
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
I'm so in on that.

412
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
A lot of flash mobbing.

413
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
I get the fan to come this year.

414
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,920
Uh, I think it's an absolute superb idea.

415
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,920
So this is, uh, the idea I had for the UK,

416
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,920
and you're going to hear in the rest of today's show that this is something we should be looking at

417
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
worldwide.

418
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,920
Um, that, you know, we need to wake up in the UK and we need to say,

419
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,920
hey, hold on a second, you know, you work for us.

420
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
So we need T shirts.

421
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
We need to organize flash mobs.

422
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,920
Charles is in.

423
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,920
So he's going to help out with at least part of it.

424
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Uh, I really need someone who's who's good at organizing flash mob to take over that job.

425
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
And I'm not going to do any of this.

426
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,920
I'll be happy to propagate and talk about it and promote and take some heat for it,

427
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
which I'm sure will come.

428
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,920
Uh, but, you know, the UK residents, UK citizens,

429
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,920
you guys really have to do this.

430
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,920
So Charles is in and he's drunk.

431
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
So, uh, help me.

432
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
Shake on some of this afternoon.

433
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
I feel towards the country.

434
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,920
You have to, you're right.

435
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,920
Uh, the losing is, uh, a symptom of, uh,

436
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,920
the safety of the society.

437
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,920
And, um, yeah, you know, you sort of waking me up a little bit.

438
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
I appreciate that.

439
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,920
I don't think you're an asshole, but, uh, I do appreciate all that you do.

440
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
Call it a gay guy.

441
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,920
Hey, Charles, man.

442
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
I appreciate it.

443
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
Thank you very much.

444
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
That's for you.

445
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
You dick.

446
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,920
Uh, so this is, um,

447
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,920
this awakening from apathy is spreading worldwide.

448
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
I can really feel it.

449
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,920
You know, I've got Charles over in the UK, uh,

450
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,920
who pretty much has always despised me and everything I had to say.

451
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
And now he's turning around.

452
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,920
He's waking up, which I really appreciate and think is cool.

453
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,920
And now we've got a lot of people think in this way.

454
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,920
And this is a three minute comment,

455
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,920
which actually, I want to play uninterrupted.

456
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,920
I almost considered getting, uh, some God bless America music to play.

457
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
I don't need it.

458
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Because, and maybe I'll even look for that while it's playing.

459
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,920
But listen to this because this is, uh,

460
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,920
fellow American citizen who is waking up and is understanding what's going on.

461
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,920
And is seeing the problems and wants to do something about it.

462
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Hey, Adam, hey, this is Mark in Los Angeles.

463
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,920
He called me the Sinnell's Weasel a couple of weeks ago.

464
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Well, that's because you are the sales weasel.

465
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
I'm sorry.

466
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
I'm free and interrupting.

467
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,920
Look at, you know, I don't want to be long-winded here.

468
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
Because I leave you messages, but, uh,

469
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
and I know that you get tired of them.

470
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Because a lot of times I'm drunk and I'm talking.

471
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
And anyways.

472
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,920
But you know, you know what they say.

473
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,920
Children and drunk people always speak the truth.

474
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,920
One call is correct.

475
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
He's absolutely correct.

476
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,920
And I'll even add one more to it.

477
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,920
I've been walking today in Los Angeles.

478
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,920
One of the very few that used the sidewalks.

479
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,920
Here it is, my day off and present this day.

480
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,920
And everybody fucking drives.

481
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,920
The truth of the matter is, and it comes right down to this.

482
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,920
It's oil.

483
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,920
Americans will die for oil.

484
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,920
We prove it over and over again.

485
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,920
That's why we're in the mess we are in right now.

486
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,920
That's why.

487
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,920
We don't ever get away from mental.

488
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,920
And Ron Paul speaks truth.

489
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,920
He asked questions that we need to listen to.

490
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,920
And I don't think most Americans can stomach it.

491
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:18,920
And I think he's the only only person on the ticket right now for the Republicans

492
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:23,920
that you have to consider and say why isn't this guy getting a fair shot.

493
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,920
At the end, I hope Obama gets it.

494
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,920
If it's going to not be Ron Paul, but then it just hurts me.

495
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:39,920
That a man gets up a doctor, a brilliant man who starts speaking something that's precious.

496
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,920
The Constitution.

497
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,920
The reason why we're a country.

498
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,920
Why we have our rights.

499
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,920
And he speaks about it.

500
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,920
And all we're interested in right now is oil.

501
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:58,920
And it's so sad because at the end of the day, we lost our souls.

502
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,920
We just lost our souls because of this stupid black coal.

503
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
And we all want our cars.

504
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,920
We never get to know.

505
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
We never walk.

506
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,920
We never get to know our neighbors or friends.

507
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,920
We never get to our roots.

508
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,920
And there's so much more.

509
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,920
I mean, I may be happy too much.

510
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,920
But what can we get to be more?

511
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,920
Why is America settling for 30 years or 31st in education?

512
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,920
Why are we settling for just what we got right now?

513
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,920
You know, healthcare does not have to be a problem.

514
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,920
If we just give our heads out of our asses and start talking to each other.

515
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,920
And now we're going to, yeah, I'm sorry.

516
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,920
I'm just, I do care about this country.

517
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,920
I care about the people that lost their lives over there and overseas.

518
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,920
I care about the best, the patriots.

519
00:32:52,920 --> 00:33:00,920
I mean, but don't they need something more than just a economy that's based on oil?

520
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:08,920
You know, unfortunately he went past the three-minute mark on the, that's the limitation on the voice mail.

521
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:14,920
But while man, you really spoke from the heart and I think it really showed and it really,

522
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,920
yeah, that hit me and I really appreciate that.

523
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:24,920
And you know, those of you who were just listening in right now rewind three minutes.

524
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,920
Listen to that again, listen to what your fellow Americans are saying.

525
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,920
And regarding healthcare, by the way, yeah, of course.

526
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,920
But you know, the problem isn't paying for healthcare.

527
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,920
The problem is the crazy system where it's everything is rigged.

528
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,920
The prices are outrageous.

529
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:47,920
And you've got, you know, medicare, you've got the government basically doing a no-bid negotiation with the pharmaceutical country companies.

530
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:53,920
And there's, yeah, oh man, it's, it's messed up.

531
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,920
We got an update, Ranger Craig has more on the, what is it, Craig?

532
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,920
You have information on the satellite or on the media or impact?

533
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,920
I'm in satellite.

534
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,920
I have the satellite hit me man, what's going on?

535
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,920
Well, apparently it was, I'm, and this will launch by the U.S. Navy from the U.S.

536
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Lake Erie, which I grew up on the shores of, we used to call it the great swamp area back in the day.

537
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,920
And it was an EGF satellite and I made a rocket.

538
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:26,920
And they were concerned about the fuel tank, which apparently contains toxic hydrogen.

539
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,920
They wanted to make sure it didn't come down now.

540
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,920
I can't imagine the fuel tank re-entering in tax, so I wonder about that.

541
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,920
Does the union of concerned scientists group, I generally had some respect for,

542
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:44,920
and they're a little concerned that this is just basically anti-Satellite test by the defense department?

543
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,920
Yeah, see that? I, I buy that theory.

544
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,920
I, I think it's a, it's a big FU to the rest of the world saying, you know,

545
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,920
and as I just discussed with, with Captain Chris, like, look what we can do.

546
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,920
Hands behind my back and I shot that fuck around this guy.

547
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,920
It's kind of sad to me, too. I grew up with the space program.

548
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,920
I remember watching the first mercury flights on a little black and white TV and stuff and being a big science fiction fan.

549
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,920
You know, you know, we always thought space would be kind of off of limits or help to avoid bad luck.

550
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
I guess not. That's made by suppose.

551
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,920
Hey Craig, how's everything going on in the rock man?

552
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,920
Cause you're a range of Craig from, uh, aquatras.

553
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,920
It's great. It's great. Cold and wet here lately.

554
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,920
I'm getting a little break in the names while you were gone.

555
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,920
And now that you're back, it's raining again.

556
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,920
But I know, I see, I seem to be responsible for it.

557
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,920
Holding a cell on the dungeon for you.

558
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,920
So I'll let me know when you get this.

559
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,920
I appreciate, can I, can I, um, do a show from, from the cell in the dungeon?

560
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,920
Do you have any connectivity there?

561
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,920
It can be done.

562
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,920
It's something we have to do officially to our public affairs office.

563
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
But yeah, yeah.

564
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,920
Yeah.

565
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
What do you call it?

566
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
You got connectivity.

567
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,920
Do you have, uh, is there an internet connection?

568
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,920
Um, it's always a government networks.

569
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,920
That's kind of funky because, um, we're not allowed to access things like Skype and stuff.

570
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
So that there could be a problem.

571
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
But there's ways around that.

572
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,920
We can tap into the phone line raw, um, radio stations and stuff.

573
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,920
I've done it up the media.

574
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,920
Well, theater in the cell house.

575
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
We have no theater.

576
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,920
And it was also used as a chapel where it meets, um, went to church and would see a occasional, uh,

577
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,920
uh, very, um, my old movies.

578
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,920
They're very careful about the movies.

579
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,920
They should have had there.

580
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,920
But they should have moved me once a month or so.

581
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
All right.

582
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
But it's basically a tourist attraction, right?

583
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,920
Yeah.

584
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,920
It's a national park.

585
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,920
Yeah.

586
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
Yeah.

587
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,920
So we, uh, I promote it, man.

588
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
I do a huge promotion.

589
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
You know, we make a big deal out of it.

590
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,920
I think we should stay overnight in the cell.

591
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,920
You know, we'd make something like throw curry in jail or send Adam to get

592
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,920
Mo or something like that.

593
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
Uh, and then I'll promote the park.

594
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,920
We'll get lots of people showing up.

595
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
If you can work it out, I'll be happy to do it.

596
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,920
It'll be fun.

597
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Yeah.

598
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
Well, let's talk about it there.

599
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,920
I'll sometimes I get an idea.

600
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,920
Uh, idiotica is, uh, idiotica, you want?

601
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,920
Can you talk?

602
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,920
Have you, uh, you're looking at the evil Adam curry?

603
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,920
Yeah, I am.

604
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,920
And, uh, so, so you just posted a link.

605
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,920
Did you, uh, get into this guy's my space profile?

606
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,920
Yeah.

607
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,920
I think course actually posted that I was just, uh, talking about it.

608
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,920
Okay.

609
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,920
Of course it doesn't have, uh, I can't talk.

610
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,920
So, uh, what does, what does this guy look like?

611
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,920
Doesn't he look like he could be a, a scary terrorist dude?

612
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,920
What is?

613
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,920
Of course there's ages 23 and there's just no way.

614
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,920
He's got a pretty nasty little go-to you going.

615
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,920
I think it's him, man.

616
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,920
That's him.

617
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,920
All right.

618
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,920
Miss something's in Brooklyn.

619
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,920
Welcome.

620
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,920
Good to see you on.

621
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,920
Hi there.

622
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
Hey, baby.

623
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,920
How are you doing?

624
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,920
I have some wine tonight.

625
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
Oh.

626
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
How much wine?

627
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,920
How much wine?

628
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
Wait a minute.

629
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,920
How much?

630
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,920
Two glasses?

631
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
Two glasses.

632
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,920
That's just a little bit of wine.

633
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,920
That's not so much.

634
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,920
I would just go.

635
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
I'm a lightly.

636
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,920
Uh huh.

637
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,920
So you feeling a little woozy right now?

638
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,920
I am.

639
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,920
I wore a fillet.

640
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,920
Are you feeling warm all over?

641
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,920
Yeah.

642
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
Mm-hmm.

643
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
How was work today?

644
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,920
How was the advertising business?

645
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,920
Crazyness.

646
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
Really?

647
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,920
I was offered a spontaneous promotion and I'm considering it.

648
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Really?

649
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,920
Tell me about it.

650
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
What's the gig?

651
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
Uh a lot to gain a lot to lose.

652
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,920
You know, typical situation.

653
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,920
Okay.

654
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,920
I don't know what to help you talk about.

655
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,920
I find that timing.

656
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
What?

657
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,920
What?

658
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,920
Wink or girl is coming to visit tomorrow.

659
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,920
She arrives from Canada.

660
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
Oh.

661
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,920
Okay.

662
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
I'm excited that my podcasting buddy is in town.

663
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,920
And we'll be cheering up the city and doing our thing.

664
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,920
Well, listen.

665
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Can we do something tomorrow?

666
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,920
If you guys are around, maybe you have some wine together.

667
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,920
And then you call me and then we'll talk about how much fun you're having together.

668
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,920
Sounds like a plan.

669
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,920
And you guys were talking about serious stuff.

670
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,920
And I love that stuff too.

671
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
But yeah, we'll be here.

672
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
Okay.

673
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
I love it.

674
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,920
Women on wine.

675
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,920
There's nothing like it.

676
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,920
You got girls at him.

677
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,920
You got girls.

678
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,920
I wish I had more girls.

679
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,920
I got to tell you.

680
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,920
Um.

681
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,920
I'm not enough.

682
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,920
You know.

683
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,920
The, you know, the data source code survey, which is still up.

684
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,920
I have it permanently in the show note links.

685
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,920
Um.

686
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,920
I got to take that.

687
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,920
Make sure I'm counted.

688
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,920
Well, it seems like there's a 30.

689
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,920
I think it was like 38% or 30% of the women are listeners.

690
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,920
Or the listeners are women.

691
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
I'm sorry.

692
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,920
I've had some wine.

693
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,920
Um.

694
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,920
And that's cool.

695
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,920
But, you know, they need to call in.

696
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,920
And.

697
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,920
Preferably.

698
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,920
You have some sexy to say.

699
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,920
You know.

700
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
And we will.

701
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
Because I'm.

702
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,920
Because you know, I'm your serious.

703
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,920
Yeah, I've been here for a couple days already.

704
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,920
And it's going to be a long couple of weeks.

705
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,920
And I get lonely.

706
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
And, you know, when you call up.

707
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
You know, you know, I met you in San Francisco.

708
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,920
No, you're kidding.

709
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,920
When?

710
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,920
I did.

711
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,920
We back at a donature gathering probably two years ago.

712
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,920
Oh, the one where the, with the fountain in the, in the lobby is at the place.

713
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,920
I didn't know it was a from far.

714
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,920
I don't remember.

715
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,920
I'm.

716
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,920
My brain is.

717
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,920
My brain is so far.

718
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,920
But I think I accused you of, um, bringing, trying to be into the hood.

719
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,920
And also building up to some bad things.

720
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,920
Uh, I don't remember, darling.

721
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,920
I really don't.

722
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,920
I'm sorry.

723
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
That's the right.

724
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,920
Okay.

725
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,920
Oh, hang out for a little bit.

726
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,920
And, uh, we'll definitely talk somewhere tomorrow.

727
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,920
Because like I said, my entertainers.

728
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,920
I'm sorry.

729
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,920
I'm just listening in because this is my entertainment right now.

730
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
Okay.

731
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,920
I'll tell you.

732
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,920
Why don't you have another glass of wine.

733
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,920
And, uh, then we'll talk in a couple minutes.

734
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Okay.

735
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,920
Cool baby.

736
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Thank you.

737
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,920
I had a Mr. Dan from Green Rapids, Michigan.

738
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,920
Uh, 41 of the folder.

739
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,920
Um, you mentioned about why don't people get, where's the outrage?

740
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,920
And you mentioned the book in 1984.

741
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,920
Um, in the book in 1984, um, he said the polls.

742
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,920
Which is like the peasants for the people.

743
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,920
We'll never rise up.

744
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,920
And then in the end, um, Winston Smith.

745
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,920
He's, uh, you know, big brother triumphs.

746
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,920
And Winston Smith, the, uh, hero of the story is, uh, he believes he's sitting in a

747
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,920
coffee house, believing all the propaganda.

748
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,920
So that's a bad example.

749
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,920
Um, also as far as a red pill goes.

750
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,920
And then we'll be the matrix.

751
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,920
There's one character, um, who took the red pill.

752
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
And then he gets all mad about it.

753
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,920
And says he wishes he had to take in the blue pill.

754
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,920
I think a lot of people are like that.

755
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,920
It's just laziness.

756
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,920
And people just, I'm, I'm part of the problem.

757
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,920
I mean, I mean, I'm in America and it's turned into a police state.

758
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,920
And, um, I'm not doing anything about it.

759
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,920
And I think that's the problem.

760
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
Sorry.

761
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,920
Anyway, I love you.

762
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,920
Bye.

763
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,920
You know what, man?

764
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,920
That's not true because you already are doing something about it just by

765
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,920
talking about it.

766
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,920
So don't feel bad.

767
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,920
Awakening takes a little while.

768
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,920
It's not as simple as just taking a red pill.

769
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,920
When you go down the shoot and you pop out the other end.

770
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,920
And now I know what's going on.

771
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,920
Just to let me know.

772
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,920
It's, uh, it takes a little while.

773
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,920
Anyway, man, love you.

774
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Me in at no home.

775
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,920
Hey, Adam.

776
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,920
Just in your hands for you.

777
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,920
I say happy president today.

778
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,920
Oh, sorry.

779
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,920
Obviously, this is a call from a couple days ago.

780
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,920
Yeah.

781
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,920
I got to think in after listen to your last show.

782
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,920
But all the litany of, uh, of, uh, goodbye saying that people haven't.

783
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,920
And it got, the, the, the no-home old thing got me thinking.

784
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,920
And if I was a home of sexual, although I'm not, um, I'm not sure how I feel about that.

785
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,920
I'm not sure that that it would, uh, be,

786
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,920
construed in a positive light or it seems to have a negative connotation.

787
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,920
Like, of course, I'm not, you know.

788
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
Guy talk, locker room talk.

789
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,920
I'm sure you got gay listeners, man.

790
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,920
And I'm not sure you want that connotation.

791
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,920
Maybe they, maybe they'd take it differently than I.

792
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,920
But just thought I'd bring that up later.

793
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,920
Well, you know, um, good point.

794
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:12,920
And now that I've been, actually since I heard this comment and I previewed it before I played it on the air,

795
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,920
uh, you make a good point because if someone was just coming in to, uh,

796
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,920
into the, uh, the chucklehead community.

797
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,920
And you hear that.

798
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,920
And if it's not said in, um, in the right order, if it's not,

799
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,920
love you, no-home, then it's very confusing.

800
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,920
So obviously, it has, uh, it has nothing to do with.

801
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,920
It's, it's a guy thing.

802
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,920
It's for Americans because American guys have problems with telling another man,

803
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,920
they love them without some connotation.

804
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,920
So, you know, we can't, um, hug each other and do what most American males do with

805
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
slapping each other really hard on the back.

806
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,920
Yeah, I love your man.

807
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,920
You know, because we got to be a macho.

808
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,920
So this is kind of the virtual version of it is just by saying,

809
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,920
hey, man, love, you know, homo.

810
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,920
But, uh, if you are always not proud, do we have anyone who's gay on the,

811
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,920
in the, um, in the conference call right now?

812
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,920
Can I out anybody?

813
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,920
Okay, that would be a solid no.

814
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,920
And anyone take a fence because it's not mad.

815
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,920
I'll stop doing it and I think you all should stop doing it.

816
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,920
If anyone's taking a fence to it, but I, I don't, I don't think it's a problem.

817
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
I hope not.

818
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,920
We can always keep it with great hair.

819
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,920
Love you, mean it, hope you win.

820
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,920
That works for me too.

821
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,920
Hey, miss something.

822
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,920
How you doing?

823
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,920
You done with your next class or wine?

824
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,920
I know I just bored it.

825
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,920
Hmm.

826
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,920
What are you wearing?

827
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,920
I don't know.

828
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,920
You're what?

829
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,920
You're wearing what?

830
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,920
I'm wearing predominant.

831
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,920
Uh-huh.

832
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
What kind of pajamas?

833
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,920
Oh, wait, let me guess something.

834
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,920
Are they, um, so you got pajama bottoms and pajama top?

835
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,920
Yeah, I'm simple like that.

836
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,920
I was actually, I will say I was supposed to have a booty call tonight.

837
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,920
And it failed.

838
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,920
You made a booty call and it failed?

839
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,920
It failed.

840
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,920
Boys are so dumb.

841
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,920
You can't get that word.

842
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,920
I said, hey, I got two weeks.

843
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,920
I have a house guest here and you want to meet up?

844
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,920
And there was some work thing.

845
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,920
So who is this guy?

846
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,920
Is he living the city?

847
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,920
Is he living Brooklyn?

848
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,920
Good question.

849
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,920
He lives in Jersey and he contracts.

850
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,920
So he's in the city during the week.

851
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,920
Okay.

852
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,920
And so he did he just say no.

853
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,920
I don't feel like it or he didn't show or how to handle it.

854
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,920
I don't know.

855
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,920
He's strong enough.

856
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,920
You're kidding me.

857
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,920
No.

858
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,920
That's, that is, that is so wrong.

859
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
You know, if I were in Brooklyn right now,

860
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,920
I'd be your booty call, baby.

861
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,920
I would hope so.

862
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,920
And the worst part is, I've met him before.

863
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,920
And he's, I thought he was a good guy.

864
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,920
But whatever.

865
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,920
Have you been intimate with him yet?

866
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,920
Or is it?

867
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,920
I've grown ever.

868
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,920
Chissus and tells.

869
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,920
Okay.

870
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,920
So that's a yes.

871
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,920
Yeah.

872
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,920
I have.

873
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,920
Right.

874
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,920
Okay.

875
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,920
So he's a good booty call.

876
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,920
He's, he does it for you.

877
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,920
He takes all the boxes.

878
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,920
He gets for a super short guy.

879
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,920
Yeah.

880
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,920
Hey, we discussed this last time.

881
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,920
I'm sure it.

882
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,920
I'm like five two.

883
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,920
He's not much taller than I am.

884
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,920
Okay.

885
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,920
Well, yeah.

886
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,920
I can understand that.

887
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,920
Because I'm all, you know, Patricia is, well, she says she's five six.

888
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,920
But it's horseshit.

889
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,920
She's five two.

890
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,920
Maybe maybe close to five six.

891
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,920
He knows.

892
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,920
He knows.

893
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,920
He knows.

894
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,920
He knows.

895
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,920
It's really hard because I really miss hugging someone.

896
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,920
My height.

897
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,920
And roll at this point in my life.

898
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,920
Because, you know, the sex for us is just, you know, that pinwheel, right?

899
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,920
That works perfectly.

900
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,920
But okay.

901
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,920
So you're wearing pajamas.

902
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,920
You didn't get a booty call.

903
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,920
So you're drinking a little bit of wine.

904
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,920
And you're listening to the show.

905
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,920
And then you're, are you feeling kind of groovy right now?

906
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,920
A little bit because I have to figure out what I'm going to do to go to bed.

907
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,920
Oh, you need to, you can't sleep yet.

908
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,920
You need to do something to get to sleep, right?

909
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,920
You can sing.

910
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,920
I do everything.

911
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,920
Hmm.

912
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,920
What do you do every night?

913
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,920
Uh, it involves batteries.

914
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,920
If I'm not seeing someone else.

915
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,920
Really?

916
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,920
Of course.

917
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,920
Hmm.

918
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,920
Every night?

919
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,920
Uh, I've become a little, uh, let's start.

920
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,920
Yeah, there's a pattern.

921
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,920
Really?

922
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,920
It's okay, though.

923
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:42,920
I, I think it's okay to, um, I think it's okay to do that every night.

924
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,920
That's okay.

925
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,920
If you need to go to sleep.

926
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,920
Yeah.

927
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,920
You're going.

928
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,920
Okay.

929
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,920
I, I discovered the solo joys.

930
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,920
A little bit later.

931
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,920
And I discovered, uh, achieving a big go with another person.

932
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,920
Really?

933
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,920
What?

934
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,920
A little backwards.

935
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:05,920
How old were you when you, uh, first took the hand to yourself?

936
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,920
That's what's very backwards.

937
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,920
I, um, I started in with people of the opposite sex when I was in my young teens.

938
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,920
But I did not discover the ability to do it myself until I was in my 20s.

939
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,920
Really?

940
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,920
But you'd heard about it.

941
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,920
Yeah.

942
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,920
Oh, of course.

943
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,920
Yeah.

944
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,920
Someone told you about it.

945
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,920
But yeah.

946
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,920
I think I might have heard a little bit of a sudden.

947
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,920
Uh-huh.

948
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,920
Okay.

949
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,920
So, um, what kind of vibrator do you have?

950
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,920
Is it, uh, particular collar?

951
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,920
Do you have a favorite one?

952
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,920
Do you have, uh, do you have a couple different ones?

953
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,920
Is it one that you used for talking about?

954
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,920
Period things.

955
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,920
And I'm going to be branded as the girl that derails the serious conversation.

956
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,920
I certainly hope so.

957
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,920
Uh-huh.

958
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,920
It's always the same.

959
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,920
Always the same.

960
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,920
I think I've bought about four or five of them.

961
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,920
And I buy them from my friends as gifts.

962
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,920
Really?

963
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,920
Oh, that's great.

964
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,920
That's the gift that keeps on giving, isn't it?

965
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,920
It is.

966
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,920
Because at the end of the day, always go to the store and buy batteries.

967
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,920
Hmm.

968
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,920
And I always buy a little tiny, uh, purple pocket rocket.

969
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,920
All right.

970
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,920
So, you can take it to work?

971
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,920
No, no, no, no.

972
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,920
You've never done that at work.

973
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,920
You've never thought, oh, man.

974
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,920
I just, I just need to relax.

975
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,920
I just need to get rid of some stress.

976
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,920
I'm just going to go take a couple minutes for myself.

977
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,920
I'm not going to lie.

978
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,920
There have been times when it's in, in really rough.

979
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,920
And I'm like, whoa.

980
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,920
What's this?

981
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,920
When I go into bathroom and I'm like, I am so close.

982
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,920
Yeah.

983
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,920
Oh, I really told it.

984
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,920
Wait till you get home.

985
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,920
Oh, that's the best.

986
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,920
So you're like charged all day.

987
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,920
Oh, yeah.

988
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,920
Yeah.

989
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,920
Well, this is something I could talk with you about this for hours and hours.

990
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,920
I really could.

991
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,920
And, and I look forward to having more conversations with you and why,

992
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,920
and a wanker girl, uh, when she comes in.

993
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,920
She's coming into tomorrow.

994
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,920
Sure.

995
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,920
Okay.

996
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,920
Excellent, darling.

997
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,920
I really appreciate this, you know,

998
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,920
because I'm an old guy and this makes me feel really hot.

999
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,920
Okay, darling.

1000
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,920
Ah, we got our content noise.

1001
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,920
Uh, one more song than for today's Charlie.

1002
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,920
We're, uh, moving right ahead in the time.

1003
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,920
Uh, I found out Rosie who, uh, works at HQ here,

1004
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,920
who's really into the, into the music scene.

1005
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,920
She told me that one of my favorite bands is performing Friday night in San Francisco.

1006
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,920
Of course, now that I'm saying this on the show,

1007
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,920
I'm sure they'll know that I'm going to show up because I'm totally planning

1008
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,920
on going to see the list of these videos.

1009
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,920
They perform here in San Francisco.

1010
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,920
I forget what the venue is.

1011
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,920
In fact, let me just, uh, let me just look that up.

1012
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,920
So I don't have to, I'll probably have to put it in the show.

1013
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:35,920
No, it's right.

1014
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,920
Here we go.

1015
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,920
Um, the CBS Bities are performing this Friday the 22nd at 9 p.m.

1016
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,920
at the House of Shields.

1017
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,920
That's a bar located on New Montgomery Street near market.

1018
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,920
Not far from my place.

1019
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,920
She says an extremely short taxi ride or a long walk.

1020
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,920
Well, I just might have a long walk.

1021
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,920
I just might have a long walk.

1022
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,920
I just might have a long walk.

1023
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,920
I just might have a long walk.

1024
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,920
Excuse me, might have a long walk.

1025
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,920
And as we're talking about this in the office.

1026
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,920
And I can't remember what it, why, but maybe actually

1027
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,920
it was reversed.

1028
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,920
We were talking about Mr. Rogers.

1029
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,920
I don't know.

1030
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,920
I don't know what.

1031
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,920
I have someone said, it's a lovely day in the neighborhood.

1032
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,920
And I said, oh, man, I really miss Mr. Rogers.

1033
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,920
You know, what a shame that he passed away.

1034
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,920
And then I started singing the song, The La Civius Bities,

1035
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,920
wrote about Mr. Rogers.

1036
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,920
Of course, those of you who have never seen this,

1037
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,920
won't get it, but you'll probably like the song anyway.

1038
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,920
It's called neighbor.

1039
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,920
It's the La Civius Bities on the daily source code.

1040
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:32,920
When you walk, the door in your change just shows you switch to a sweater

1041
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,920
and said, how do you do neighbor?

1042
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,920
How do you do?

1043
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,920
I remember the look in your sparkle eyes.

1044
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,920
Then secondly, I love you.

1045
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,920
Don't do all the night.

1046
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,920
I love you. Don't do all the night.

1047
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,920
It's neighbor.

1048
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,920
It's all me looking at you.

1049
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,920
I'll pick your picture.

1050
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,920
I'll buy the wildly old street.

1051
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,920
Standing tall and I'll maybe go round.

1052
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,920
Spin it away, Charlie.

1053
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,920
Ooh, Charlie.

1054
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,920
Where did you go today?

1055
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,920
Well, we played with Sandy.

1056
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,920
We have for walks in the park.

1057
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,920
You were a gentle man.

1058
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,920
We were home before dawn.

1059
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,920
Neighbors.

1060
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,920
Me, delivery.

1061
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,920
Make me believe.

1062
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,920
Chef Brock gets showed.

1063
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,920
It's hard to beg a pie.

1064
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,920
Well, lady, Elaine gave him the evil eye neighbor.

1065
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,920
You never acted that way.

1066
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,920
In the whole world, he said,

1067
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,920
There's only one need.

1068
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,920
I didn't your world.

1069
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,920
I was happy to be your neighbor.

1070
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,920
All with the wood with lady,

1071
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,920
I've been learning.

1072
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,920
Lady, I've been learning.

1073
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,920
She was so pretty.

1074
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:22,920
I came home today with our way on my mind.

1075
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,920
Life isn't simple anymore.

1076
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,920
But I know where I am.

1077
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:35,920
I came home today with our way on my mind.

1078
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,920
Life isn't simple anymore.

1079
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,920
But I know where I can find you.

1080
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,920
You said, there's only one need.

1081
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,920
I didn't your world.

1082
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,920
I was happy to be your neighbor.

1083
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,920
All with the wood with lady, I've been learning.

1084
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,920
I know where all you said,

1085
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,920
There's only one need in your world.

1086
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,920
I was happy to be your neighbor.

1087
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,920
All with the wood with lady, I've been learning.

1088
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,920
Lady, I've been learning.

1089
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:17,920
She was so pretty.

1090
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,920
Thank you, friend.

1091
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,920
She was so pretty.

1092
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,920
On episode 726 of the Daily Source Code,

1093
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,920
Adam's going Oprah.

1094
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,920
He's giving a free iPod Touch

1095
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,920
to everyone in the studio audience.

1096
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,920
Wait, let me read the fine print here.

1097
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,920
Must be present to win.

1098
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,920
Well, I didn't go to work.

1099
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,920
Here's the DSC 726.

1100
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,920
Thanks, buddy.

1101
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,920
I came in a little bit late.

1102
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,920
Anyway, that's, I think that wraps it up for today's Daily Source Code.

1103
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,920
What I didn't get to, let me see some of the topics that, and by the way,

1104
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,920
I did post a, a topic list on curry.com,

1105
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,920
about 15 minutes before I started the show and that kind of work.

1106
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,920
But again, we need more hand raising going on.

1107
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,920
But maybe I need to do the show a little bit earlier.

1108
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,920
That might help as well.

1109
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:11,920
I didn't get to the northern rock, which I just called a disaster because this is the bank

1110
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,920
in the UK that the government bailed out with a total of about 50 billion pounds,

1111
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:22,920
a hundred billion dollars in guarantees and insurance coverage for deposits.

1112
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,920
They've nationalized it, which of course screws up a lot of things.

1113
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,920
And certainly something I'd like to talk about.

1114
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,920
I'm expecting a lot of phone calls from the UK about it in the next day or two,

1115
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,920
so we will get to that.

1116
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,920
And of course, when I'm back in the UK, it helps me a little bit talking about UK stuff.

1117
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,920
And you're being as San Francisco is just not quite the same.

1118
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,920
So thank you all very much for participating in today's program.

1119
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,920
Miss something when you switch on your love machine.

1120
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,920
I hope you think of me tonight.

1121
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,920
I think she's already doing it.

1122
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,920
Adam and podshow.com.

1123
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,920
For all of all of the links with a little bit of luck, a little bit of something

1124
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,920
then a little Miss Wanker girl tomorrow on the daily source code.

1125
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,920
Be on the lookout.curry.com and on Twitter for the announcement when we record the show.

1126
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,920
I'm liking this.

1127
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,920
I think this is just my work.

1128
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,920
Let's try it again tomorrow.

1129
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,920
Thanks again, everybody.

1130
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,920
And remember to live your life with passion.

1131
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,920
And while it lasts, enjoy your freedom.

1132
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,920
Another podshow podcast.

1133
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,920
Stick it in your ear.

1134
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,920
Yeah.
