1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
Critics say that Adam Curry is trying to brainwash us, but he's trying to get some message

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,240
across through some blinnable messages through his mind tricks or something and I just

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,240
don't see it.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,600
I've gone back, I've analyzed older shows and I don't know, I went back to the San Seo

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,560
days when Adam would burp and say San Seo and we all kind of caught onto that.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,840
Then he tells us how to make a great cup of coffee.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,800
Pump that, that's like that bad boy up and down.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,960
You pump it, you pump it, you pump it, and then all of a sudden it becomes frothy.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,480
Then with Trinity, trying to get us into biofuels where you basically went, you got

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,000
vegetable oil and grease and stuff from a fast food restaurant.

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,320
Instead of pumping gas, you use the vegetable oil and you pump it, you pump it, you pump

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,040
it, then the fitness craze hit and of course with any Mac, he told us all to pump it,

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,480
you pump it, you pump it, you pump it, you pump it, you pump it, and now here we are trying

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,680
to prevent cancer in Adam's solution to that is to pump that, that's like that bad boy

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,360
up and down, you pump it, you pump it, you pump it, you pump it, and then all of a sudden

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,360
becomes frothy.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,140
So I don't see how the critics can say that Adam is trying to shove some message into

18
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,140
our head.

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,140
I mean, it's just ridiculous.

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,920
We'll see what new he is to say on the DSC 763.

21
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,360
We'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,560
we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do,

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,560
we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,560
we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do,

25
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,560
we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,560
we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:22,560
will see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what we can do, we'll see what you can

28
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,760
Oh yeah, don't become the way in the game

29
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,280
I've come as often as I can to the end

30
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,480
You don't stop me, I don't come to the count

31
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,160
What do you want, seems so up to

32
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,160
But again, I know I'll go ahead and tell me you won't be a game

33
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,360
But I'll see that the old kid and I don't want any of my own friends

34
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,560
I used to go rock, this is a hole

35
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,160
They're not funny, stop smiling, still don't move

36
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,160
But the money, but now I've learned to earn

37
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,360
Because I'm right, dude, I feel free

38
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,560
To maybe I might do so four and nine and five

39
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,360
If I thrive, maybe I stay alive

40
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,560
So I'll walk up street with this feeling

41
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Our place was manned by a mist

42
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,760
A pen and a paper, I stare with your taste

43
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,960
From me and everything in a nice big plate of this

44
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,760
Which is my favorite dish

45
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,160
But without the money, it's still a wish

46
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,360
To try to like scream about deep in any

47
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,360
So I dig it through the books of the vows that I made

48
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,960
So that's let's see if I got pulled

49
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,360
If I still be yo, cause I'm paining

50
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,960
Ah, looks like party band Taylor made it for this particular source code

51
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,360
Hey, bump on the door now

52
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,360
And that's right, we're pumping it, we're pumping it, we're pumping one out for frosting

53
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Cancer prevention

54
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
Yeah, we know the pain

55
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,160
Oh man, if you love, I love the energy you put into those over as men

56
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,160
That's been so cool

57
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,800
It is the source code episode number 763 coming to you from the afloat of

58
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,500
aufs you yeah, effluen suburbowsori known as a ge offered everybody how you doing

59
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,660
It's good to be back apologies about Friday

60
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,480
But of course, I had four warned that I was doing the support for the lady Patricia for her final live show on

61
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,360
Holland's Got Talent which went off without a hitch and might say fantastic show

62
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,160
And we had a good time actually took us super region Keith along

63
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:53,240
Who hasn't been to Amsterdam or anywhere near, even in the Netherlands at all, for like

64
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,000
16 years or something. So it was funny having a big grit along for the ride. So when

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,840
who's very accustomed to BBC standards and practices and boy, that he have a good

66
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,320
time at the studios. So I think that's really how much to say about that, because just

67
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:16,080
you know, it was basically, I left on Thursday flew over. Oh man, it was horrible weather.

68
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,960
Just absolutely atrocious. So that meant all the fun of flying for me. And then at least

69
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,280
on the on the Dutch side, it was very, oh, so bad. When I was flying across the English

70
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,280
channel, the bad weather was right in the channel. And in fact, it started to come inland.

71
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,960
So somewhere around Canterbury, I started to hit some pretty awful conditions. And I was

72
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,440
talking to a manston approach. I don't know if his manston radar or manston approach at that

73
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,080
point, they did have radar contact with me. And I see, you know, they followed me all the

74
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,760
way to the boundary. And it was so nasty. And I was so happy that I had, you know, some radar

75
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,440
flight following so that he would know, you know, and alert me if any planes were in the

76
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,360
area. Which there weren't many actually heard people calling up big and hills saying, we're

77
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,960
returning due to bad weather. And as I signed off as, as the controller, manston released

78
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,240
me to talk to Amsterdam information. I said, I just couldn't help myself. I said, you know,

79
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,040
and by the way, major props to your boys with this shit in the 40s without GPS equipment.

80
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,240
Yes, we're proud of them. That was great. Anyway, it was nice because Christina was along

81
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,200
for for our little trip. So it was kind of a hangout. And she, of course, was her delightful

82
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:36,200
self being extremely funny. Crack an ass off. Then it's nice, man. When your kids like

83
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,120
funny in an adult way, not necessarily adult humor, but just your timing is impeccable. I love

84
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,320
it. So the racks are stacked today because I didn't get a football Friday out. So of course,

85
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,680
you know, that means that I have a hit test standing by and lots of comments regarding nylon from

86
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:01,160
762. In fact, I have stacked in the rack 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 different responses. I have an idea

87
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,640
of what I'm going to do with them. But first, let's check in with something very important that

88
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,240
it's troubling many people and it's keeping quite a few of the chuckleheads busy.

89
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:17,560
Hey Adam, this is Hans from beautiful and sunny Niagara region. I'm just listening to the DSC

90
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:24,680
761, yes, I'm a little bit behind there and had to laugh from yards off when I heard,

91
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,080
oh, done. I'm going to guide talk about, about rubbing one off.

92
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,960
That was sales guy, you, who's who's Dutch, but in Germany yet, he really has a problem with me

93
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:40,600
talking about the prostate cancer prevention quota. Because whatever he's polishing the Pope,

94
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,640
or anything of the like, he says he has visuals of me, which of course is not the desired effect.

95
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:55,960
And ever since you've started this whole topic, it came to mind what happens to when we

96
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:03,400
actually have some fun with our ladies. It counts. It really does. There's no reason why it shouldn't

97
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,520
count. And in fact, your ladies can participate in cancer prevention of the breast kind

98
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:14,360
at the same time. In fact, there's things you can do together to kind of both be rubbing one out

99
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:21,880
for cancer. Do we release our clinicians into them? I know, this is the gross, but that is gross.

100
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,400
Yeah, do we just transpose our cancer prevention to them? What's going on there? Think about it,

101
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,560
do you think about what you can do together? Anyways, I saw that I pointed out

102
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,800
because I much rather do the little cancer prevention with, with me lady. Anyways,

103
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:50,120
28, 24 times. And I'm behind a normal grade here. Hope you win. Bye. Don't forget they work for us.

104
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,920
That's the final sign off that's new. Yeah, of course, what is referring to here is the news

105
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,560
that unless you've been living under a rock, you know that minimum of five times a week

106
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,120
severely reduces your chances of prostate cancer. So use that sucker while you got it, I'd say. And

107
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,920
since since most of you have been kind of bummed out about associating me with the procedure. Well,

108
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:24,600
luckily here's one of the, uh, child rescue. It's Terry again. Oh, Terry, how are this time? I'm chiming

109
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:33,240
in to lend a helping hand to sales guy Hup and remind all of you men to indulge yourselves in the

110
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:44,360
spirit of prostate cancer prevention and rub at least one out today for your health. Have fun. Bye.

111
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,600
Oh, very, thank you so much. I really hope to meet you in a bit of thyroid.

112
00:10:48,600 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh, so she's networking. Yeah, that's right. It's all bullshit. And the ad bastards that

113
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,480
comfortable will tell you what's bullshit, what's real and also check us out on my team. Remember

114
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:23,560
Ad bastards, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip,

115
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,920
you correspond that is here once again as name is commister blogger and he checks in with a report. Hello,

116
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:36,840
Adam shaved down under Terry. You slay me dude. You see, be your you corresponded. So you say it's

117
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:43,320
now complaining to what's greater organization WTO that European Union is putting to high taxes on tech products.

118
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:50,040
I didn't know about this. That's interesting. So European Union is putting high, uh, I guess

119
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,840
import duties on tech products. Mm. Yes, it is fucking crazy that Euro currency is much stronger than

120
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,440
dollar, but anyway, say one can get some products much cheaper. In fact, I can only recommend USA as a

121
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,880
tourist destination for just to go and buy stuff for all EU citizens. So just go there by yourself,

122
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,000
laptop or other electronics. And then just pretend that you had it on you before arrival. Easy

123
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,600
PC lemon squeezes. So go to USA young man. So thank you. Let's say for the can care for us EU citizens.

124
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,280
Yo. Okay, CSP. Well, I, you know, this ties into a lot of different things. But of course,

125
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:33,160
that I have to do with the currency exchange, but yeah, man. You know, the, the, the rumor is out there

126
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,120
that the new iPod 3G is coming out. And, uh, yeah, I'm very interested in that device. I mean,

127
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,000
use the iPod touch for a while. And I absolutely love the web browser. And I wouldn't mind, you know,

128
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,840
I think I'll finally switch over get a UK number. Put myself on the grid as it were. Unfortunately,

129
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:55,720
I have to do that, um, you know, in order to get any decent, uh, type of bandwidth package,

130
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,160
they don't do it. They don't, they don't, yeah, pre-paid is just not enough. I believe me, I've,

131
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,760
I've looked at all the options and you've sent me so many over the years. Um, but I may wait.

132
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,600
I may wait until I think third week of June, I'm going to be back in San Francisco,

133
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,680
and I'll probably pick one up there. And that is, of course, if it's even going to be

134
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,840
available worldwide when it's announced. Even if the June 9th day, it's true. Who the hell knows,

135
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,720
right? So as I said, we have plenty of responses to, uh, to nylon checking in after a yet a prolonged

136
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,000
period, still undercover under a pseudonym. And, uh, well, here's one reaction I want to play in full

137
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,120
because it's from atomic rod. And as you know, he works for us. And, um, he's always got something to say

138
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,920
about, uh, nuclear energy. Hey, Adam, atomic rod Adam's here. Just want to say thank you for your

139
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,600
comments about nuclear energy on the F.C. 762. Just wanted to share with a little Washington

140
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:55,640
moment here. It's a gorgeous sunny day in Washington, B.C. And, oh, by the way, the people in

141
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,240
Washington have the same feeling about one water as they do in London. If you pay my drift,

142
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:08,200
yo, yo, I agree with you about nylon, the man should come out from under the cover and tell

143
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:14,520
you who he is. I worked with my own name, tell you what I do, and try to share my, uh,

144
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:21,400
passion for nuclear energy. And one thing I want your chocolate to think about, who do you think

145
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:30,360
benefits when people are afraid of a proven alternative to fossil fuels? You know, I got a great day.

146
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:37,320
Yo, yo, I think so much. Remember, you work for us and he really does. And your comments

147
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,240
are always highly appreciated. A lot of comments about this. A lot of people saying, hey, you know,

148
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:48,040
it really is, um, you know, just a kind of an image that we have about nuclear energy. And, uh,

149
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:54,520
you know, these new pebble reactors are much, much safer. I've gotten, uh, you know, comments about

150
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,360
there being at least three atomic subs on the bottom of the ocean. And, you know, it hasn't killed

151
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,960
us yet, uh, even responses to my saying that, hey, you know, I'm sure the CDC, the Center for Disease

152
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,720
Control doesn't keep their virus as very safe. And, you know, so people checking and listening,

153
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,800
there's a lot of stuff. I could start a whole conspiracy website just space upon this.

154
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,400
But really, let's say, let's keep looking at this nuclear energy. Remember, we're

155
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:23,000
rebranding it at new clear, because it really is new. And it is clear. And I think it may be

156
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,280
safe enough to use looking at the UK Gordon Brown now coming out. Uh, he's got to do something, right?

157
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,800
And he's saying, you know, we have to be really aggressive here in the UK, because, you know,

158
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,160
this oil is not going to be sustainable for anyone. Uh, we're stuck with these high prices

159
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,560
for a while for the foreseeable future. We can't just wait for new reactors to come online by 2020.

160
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,320
We've got to get going now. We've got to push and push hard. We've got to have lots of extra

161
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,800
capacity coming. In fact, he even said, and I think I agree with this. He says, this is a tremendous

162
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:58,680
opportunity for the empire, because that's how sometimes they refer to it, the British empire.

163
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:05,720
Ah, it's nice ring to it, doesn't it? Hi, Adam. This is Eric from Portland.

164
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,400
I'm just going in. I've been listening for a long time, and there was a wired magazine article

165
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:18,360
about three years ago. And that turned me on to really the whole podcast thing. And in that

166
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:25,640
time, there's been three shows that really stood out. And they're all when, when you really

167
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:34,040
feel attacked and push back. And, you know, mentioned those, some old chuckle heads may

168
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,840
recognize them, but there was this guy, Mad, wineful Dean. Yeah, I remember that. Who accused you

169
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:48,440
a lot of things, uh, one of which was being a homo foe. And, um, I think he said the story's great

170
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:56,680
with him, like clearly. Um, another guy named Dave Winner. And, uh, I heard of him. He just

171
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:04,520
wanted to be famous, man. And I hear that guy sometimes another, uh, another podcast and man,

172
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,880
what a annoying guy. And now the nylon, he doesn't have quite the status of the last two, but

173
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,840
here you get, uh, up in arms and, uh, defend yourself, uh, good for you. And, uh, good for you.

174
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,960
Keep it up. Um, they work for us. Yo, don't forget that. Have never.

175
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Yeah, no, I appreciate that. And, of course, I did let myself go. And I think even said it,

176
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,840
it's almost as good as sacks, you know, just letting go and yelling back at someone once in a while.

177
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,920
You know, particularly when someone with such BS, like, uh, like nylon, now I know he's listening.

178
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,440
And I'm, you know, he even called him with another comment, but I'm so tired of it. He's just,

179
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,560
you know, just repeating himself. So I'm not even going to play that. I will, however,

180
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,840
and I've been thinking, you know, I could play these back to back, but, you know, they're all,

181
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,600
they're all so nice and, which, of course, in its own way is self-serving. What I'm going to do is,

182
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,360
I'm just going to play, like, nine or 10 comments, just all through each other. Just so you can hear

183
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,960
all the love that just streaming out from the chuckle heads. There's nothing more that I can say.

184
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:07,240
Then thank you so much because, uh, it reminds me that, uh, you know, I'm not alone.

185
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,960
Does that make sense? Yeah. You know, and, and yeah, there's one guy who's, who's yelling at me,

186
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,720
but, um, you guys are there for me, and I really do appreciate it. Listen to this.

187
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,360
Adam, son of a bitch, just finished listening to that red and going back in.

188
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:42,520
MyCarl, you know, it's so easy, isn't it?

189
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,320
The white and it's easier.

190
00:18:47,320 --> 00:19:17,320
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't

191
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:28,580
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know the kind of silhouette I felt when I was young

192
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,180
I don't know, or, you know, just not like that it was really the all the way around, that is something you better than, you know,

193
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:38,180
It's a funny heart that's smiling your eyes

194
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:44,180
It's slowly fading with the last days in July

195
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:50,180
The year is drowning like the calendar rose thin

196
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:55,180
And sail away against your back against the wind

197
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:00,180
And when the cold wind blows your gun

198
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,180
And I will hold my head again

199
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:12,180
But you can run from the truth

200
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,180
Oh, the light and red

201
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:21,180
Thanks to everybody, they have no idea how good that made me feel

202
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,180
As long as going out to the nightlight

203
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,180
Some of the beaches from my world

204
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,180
There's cold and weak

205
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,180
Don't press me flowers and the pages of the diary

206
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,180
You're cute, it's still filled with spotting sign

207
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,180
I mean a bit of a huge sleep

208
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,180
As a calendar of peace

209
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:54,180
And when the cold wind blows your gun

210
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:00,180
And I will hold my head again

211
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:08,180
But you can run from the truth

212
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:16,180
Oh, the light and red

213
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,180
Oh, the light and red

214
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,180
Thanks to everybody, they have no idea how good that made me feel

215
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,180
As long as going out to the nightlight

216
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,180
Some of the beaches from my world

217
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,180
There's cold and red

218
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,180
Thanks to everybody, they have no idea how good that made me feel

219
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,180
As long as going out to the nightlight

220
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,180
And when the cold wind blows your gun

221
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,180
And I will hold my head again

222
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,180
And I will hold my head again

223
00:21:51,180 --> 00:22:02,180
And I will hold my head again

224
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,180
We're the living, the London rain

225
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,180
There you go

226
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,180
All right, I think we should now close the chapter

227
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,180
That is known as the nylon

228
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,180
Because I'm pretty much done with them

229
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,180
Thanks again, everybody, that was awesome

230
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,180
I actually sounded pretty cool in years

231
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,180
Like a million voices all showing out at him

232
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,180
Since we missed the football Friday

233
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,180
We still need to extend some of the freight train

234
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,180
Maximum music extravagance of festivities

235
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:30,180
And this is the hit test

236
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,180
Hit it test

237
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,180
Young pole

238
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,180
Hey Adam, hi doing

239
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,180
Good, better late than every hour

240
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,180
This is intro number one

241
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,180
Oh, yes, oh, yes

242
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,180
I know this one

243
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,180
Damn

244
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,180
At the car wash

245
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,180
Haven't you done this one before?

246
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,180
You want to be done car wash?

247
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,180
That's Rose Royce

248
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,180
Of course anyone from the 70s would recognize that one

249
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,180
Number two

250
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,180
Another one from the soundtrack to my life

251
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,180
That is love unlimited

252
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,180
I'm so glad I'm a woman

253
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,180
That's it

254
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,180
Yeah, I'm a woman

255
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,180
And number three

256
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,180
I thought it wasn't a roll there

257
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,180
Uh, I give up on that one y'all

258
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,180
And it's time for the answers

259
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,180
Test

260
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,180
Answer

Number one

262
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,180
It's from 1977

263
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,180
This is Rose Royce

264
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,180
Power

265
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,180
Oh, I'll sing along

266
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,180
Sing along to the hits of the 70s

Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

269
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,180
You might not ever hear me

270
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,180
It's for the end of car wash

271
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,180
Working in the car wash

272
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,180
Yeah

273
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,180
From a woman singing with me

274
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,180
Car wash

275
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,180
You're with the feeling I

00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,180
Car wash

277
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,180
Yeah, give me that

278
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,180
Rose, it's answer number one

279
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,180
Oh

280
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,180
And this is answer number two

281
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,180
Yes, yes

00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,180
And I'm so glad I'm a woman

284
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,180
That's it

285
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,180
In the morning when I wake up

286
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,180
As I call my head

287
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,180
So big

288
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,180
I'm a woman

289
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,180
So big

290
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,180
I'm a train of

00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,180
I know I want to make a

00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,180
I'm so big

293
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,180
I'm a woman

294
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,180
Two out of three

295
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,180
Love unlimited

296
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,180
Answer number two

297
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,180
And this is answer number three

298
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,180
From 1987

299
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,180
Madonna

300
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,180
Oh, Madonna

301
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,180
Oh, Madonna

302
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,180
You're mad

303
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,180
Causing a cushion

304
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,180
Baby

305
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,180
I know that you will be a great person

306
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,180
I've got to move right back

307
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,180
I'm done the motion

308
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,180
We got together with the cousin

309
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,180
Come on

310
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,180
Come on

311
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,180
Come on

312
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,180
Come on

313
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,180
Come on

314
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,180
Come on

315
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,180
Come on

316
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,180
Come on

317
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,180
Come on

318
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,180
Come on

319
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,180
Madonna

320
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,180
Come on

321
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,180
Causing the commotion

322
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,180
Number three

323
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,180
And that concludes this week's hit test

324
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,180
Number 124

325
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,180
So Adam, how did you do this week?

326
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,180
Well, I was pretty confident there

327
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,180
I got two out of three

328
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,180
And messed up on Madonna

329
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,180
But what can I say?

330
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,180
I tried it

331
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,180
Alrighty

332
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,180

338

Adam

339
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,180
Thank you for playing again

340
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,180
Everyone else

341
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,180
Thank you for listening

342
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,180
Next week I'll be back for another hit test

343
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,180
So until then

344
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,180
Have a very nice week

345
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,180
Take care

346
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,180
And remember

347
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,180
Try to think with your hearts

348
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,180
Bye-bye

349
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,180
Be back

350
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,180
Hit test

351
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,180
Emile.com

352
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,180
Info

353
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,180
Young pull-up

354
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,180
Come

355
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,180
And be a wealthy team

356
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,180
Go

357
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,180
It's always as good on

358
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,180
It's almost like

359
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,180
Like leftover spaghetti

360
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,180
You know

361
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,180
It tastes even better on Monday

362
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,180
When you had it on Friday

363
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,180
And we didn't have it on Friday

364
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,180
So it was

365
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,180
Leftovers I'm touched by human hands

366
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,180
Young pull-up

367
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,180
Thank you very much for the hit test

368
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,180
124 man

369
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,180
Cranking up the numbers there

370
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,180
Good one

371
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,180
I love love unlimited

372
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,180
I got to play that song

373
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,180
On the next week or Friday

374
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,180
Which I think

375
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,180
We'll happen this coming Friday

376
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,180
Schedules

377
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,180
Schedules permitting of course

378
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,180
Hey something

379
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,180
Pretty funky happened here in the UK

380
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,180
Saturday night

381
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,180
Going into Sunday

382
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,180
As we discussed on this show

383
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,180
And also on a no agenda

384
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,180
The show that I do with

385
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,180
John C. to War Act

386
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,180
No agenda.meavio.com

387
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,180
Boris Johnson

388
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,180
The brand new mayor of London

389
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,180
Put a new law into effect

390
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,180
That started on Sunday

391
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,180
June 1

392
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,180
Where

393
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,180
Travelers are forbidden from

394
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,180
Drinking

395
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,180
Or even having an open container

396
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,180
Of alcohol and public transport

397
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,180
And I for one

398
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,180
I'm a big fan of this

399
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,180
Of this new law

400
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,180
Because I often

401
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,180
Act fact

402
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,180
I've stopped

403
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,180
Almost

404
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,180
Completely unless I can

405
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,180
You know

406
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,180
In less as a reason

407
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,180
I'll stop traveling back from London

408
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,180
To Guilford by train

409
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,180
Which I do in the morning

410
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,180
On the way in quite happily

411
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,180
Mainly because

412
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,180
You know

413
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,180
It's even in first class

414
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,180
Oh the horrors

415
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,180
You know

416
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,180
There's drunk people

417
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,180
And they're sitting there

418
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
Drinking getting drunk

419
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,180
And it really really is annoying

420
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,180
And you know

421
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,180
They're loud

422
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,180
And they're obnoxious

423
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,180
And it's just

424
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,180
It's annoying

425
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,180
And no one does anything

426
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,180
No one says anything

427
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,180
Because you know

428
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
Let's face it

429
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,180
I don't want to get beat up

430
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,180
I'm pretty scrony guy

431
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,180
Particularly

432
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,180
There's been a football match

433
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,180
From one of the teams

434
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,180
Down South

435
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,180
Yeah

436
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,180
It's just

437
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,180
It's not okay

438
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,180
And a part of this of course

439
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,180
There's no actual

440
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,180
There wasn't a law

441
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,180
To stop this

442
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,180
Certainly

443
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,180
No control

444
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,180
No controllers

445
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,180
No law enforcement

446
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,180
I have yet to see how

447
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,180
That's going to work out

448
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,180
In fact it didn't work out very well

449
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,180
Because

450
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,180
They had one last to raw

451
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,180
One last farewell

452
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,180
To drinking

453
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,180
In public transport

454
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,180
Saturday night

455
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,180
And

456
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,180
Liverpool Street Station

457
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,180
Which is not far from

458
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,180
The London HQ

459
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,180
Over there in shortage

460
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,180
Was a complete Madhouse

461
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,180
People just drinking

462
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,180
Pugan, you know

463
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,180
Broken glass

464
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,180
Everywhere

465
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
A big ass mess

466
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,180
And you'd think

467
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,180
Which one of the chucklehead

468
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,180
Or better yet

469
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,180
Which is a bond

470
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,180
Do you think

471
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,180
Mind

472
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,180
Just mind

473
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,180
Have gone to such a party

474
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,180
Hmm

475
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,180
Let me think

476
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,180
I don't mind

477
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,180
Charles

478
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,180
The

479
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,180
Extremely hungover

480
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,180
London

481
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,180
Swan in the afternoon

482
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,180
Not just working out

483
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,180
But I'm feeling

484
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,180
Right

485
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,180
So as you can hear my voice is about

486
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,180
Six octaves low

487
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,180
And then he's normally

488
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,180
I must say it actually kind of

489
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,180
Sounds kind of sexy

490
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,180
They're Charles

491
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,180
I just want to

492
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,180
I wanted to

493
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,180
Just throw something in

494
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,180
About just

495
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,180
Not no drinking

496
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,180
On the underground

497
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,180
Boris Johnson is forcing

498
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,180
I understand why he's doing it

499
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,180
And I do believe

500
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,180
And he's social behind

501
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,180
And he's to be

502
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,180
Clacked down upon

503
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,180
Certainly assaults on the staff

504
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,180
And choose

505
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,180
Workings

506
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,180
It's just that place

507
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,180
In that city

508
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,180
Out of order

509
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,180
And needs

510
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180

Playing

537
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
To do

538
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,440
to test

539
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,680
To be

540
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,680

The

543

Moomin

544
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,220
keep that in mind okay the word liberty they was that they were

545
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,500
protesting and unfortunately when you have people protesting people

546
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,900
do take it to a level and for at least they got noticed at least

547
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,460
Charles

548
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,080
uh... people weren't doing that to get noticed they were doing it because it was a party

549
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,740
that's what happens i did as a party let's go drink over there this was not

550
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,000
maybe the first people who came up with the idea

551
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,440
and organized what i would say is an and outstanding flash mob but for all

552
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,480
the wrong reasons

553
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,000
i think uh...

554
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,360
no i don't think it was a protest i think people were just out for a good time in a

555
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,880
party

556
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,280
got the message out that we're not happy about

557
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,320
having hours out of the uh... freedom's infringement

558
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,520
now you didn't get any message out uh... Charles the in the message of any

559
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,440
they got out is uh...

560
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,660
to a bunch of drugs

561
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:49,340
subreddit was it was completely without any

562
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,500
demeanor discretion

563
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,140
any message

564
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,100
it was just about

565
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:55,900
well

566
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,220
if anything

567
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,860
it did show that there's a high level of frustration and that it's uh...

568
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,220
very volatile

569
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,860
not in control no one was in control of the situation Charles no one

570
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,500
it was not organized it was not a protest

571
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,820
it was a party

572
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,580
and everyone gate crashed that's pretty much what it was

573
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,620
i'm just not gonna accept this uh...

574
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,380
protest stuff about your liberties being taken away

575
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,460
but there's it's the point is

576
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,740
people don't get drunk on the tube

577
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,660
they will get drunk when they've been on the tube yeah okay so uh... it will

578
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,180
be okay with me

579
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,260
if people were drunk before they got on the tube were on the train

580
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,260
and then just let it off

581
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,980
but no they just tend to get drunker

582
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,380
and i'm saying this from first-hand experience uh... Charles i'm not a limo baby

583
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,380
i love taking the train in fact this makes no sense to take a car into the city or

584
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,260
out of the city

585
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,900
unless you want to avoid the drugs getting drunker

586
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,820
and they go out and then they get on and then they get on the tube while drunk

587
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,420
it's nothing to do

588
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,780
with people drinking

589
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,060
yeah except uh... i've seen completely

590
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,740
completely to the contrary

591
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,220
completely different while on public transport

592
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,740
it's everything to do

593
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:12,620
with people being anti-social and that's what really needs to be cut down upon

594
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:17,180
if someone's spending their time trying to take a can of a kind of fear of me

595
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,020
is not going to

596
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,220
improve safety

597
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,420
it's not

598
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,500
it's not going to improve safety

599
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,460
you could be right although i must say i felt reasonably unsafe in certain situations

600
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,220
on public transport

601
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,060
for this very reason

602
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,420
but i'm sure you're going to say as it's uh... it's not you're not going to let them take

603
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,020
their liberties away from you right

604
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,300
i'm going to do anything

605
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,060
all this going to do is piss me off

606
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,580
yeah and that's all that you're going to get when you're trying to take down

607
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,460
call for people

608
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,980
so dude how come you're not pissed off about uh... let me see

609
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,460
the complete breakdown of uh... mobility in the country

610
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,820
you can't get into London

611
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,940
and you can't afford to get into London anymore

612
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,100
the trains are overloaded to capacity

613
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,700
fuel is being taxed up to the hilt

614
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,100
you know this is why i was so proud of the truckers who

615
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,660
blocked off the west and that's a protest

616
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,940
that's again something that's that's against being stolen from

617
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,340
by the government who are supposed to be working for you

618
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,260
don't give you this bullshit about your beer being taken away

619
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,100
you out of your mind

620
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,300
and

621
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,100
so it's a ridiculous law it's a hollow law

622
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,740
it's very very very typical of someone like boy Johnson

623
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,900
not what's very very typical is to see that this is the one thing the one law that

624
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,500
everyone is up and arms about

625
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,660
because we're all too drunk to notice what the fuck is really going on in these countries

626
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:42,140
not just the united kingdom but also in the united states wake up people

627
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,460
who wants to be seen to be doing something in fact he's holding more problems

628
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:51,100
that's why i wanted to be London's mayor uh... and there you go

629
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,740
you watch man you watch this guy could really turn things around

630
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,780
he could really start to do some massively good things

631
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,300
and to start with he can get rid of all these stupid cameras which are completely

632
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,860
ineffective either that or my other suggestion which is sell the entire rights to all

633
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,100
cameras from London

634
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,340
to end them all and make it a big ask reality show

635
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,660
they were for my friends they said were for us

636
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,980
yeah they do they do charles

637
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,700
now give you a little leeway there because you clearly were

638
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,100
not thinking clearly a bit clouded

639
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,140
oh boy

640
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,860
i can't believe in having this conversation

641
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,300
all right uh...

642
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,340
let's talk about fuel for second shall we i'm going to end it and i'm you know what

643
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:41,180
no way to make let's uh... let's promote something placed on there we're going to talk

644
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,140
about fuel and i've got something so stunning at the end it's going to bring it to you

645
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,460
oh

646
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,580

A little bit longer, just for the heat, a little bit stronger, heavy nose, you've seen the

649
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:51,740

Last we spoke I asked if anyone could help me out understanding the

664
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,920
The price of diesel and how it's affecting you or if you even understand why the price is shot up so

665
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,960
Astronomically and of course all you have to do is call out the trucker Tom and he's there. Come on in good buddy

666
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,720
Yo Adam

667
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:31,720
Tom while Sir aka trucker Tom and Friday source code you were asking me

668
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:41,160
Person comments regarding I guess most of the fuel prices the high fuel prices now. I am a company driver

669
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:48,120
I drive for a company. I do not own the truck. Okay. I was wrong. I thought you were probably an independent

670
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,720
There Tom so okay your answer is going to be different than the maybe what I wanted but still want to hear it

671
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,720
I would not touch that business with the 10-foot pole

672
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:04,520
There's just too many things that can go wrong as you as demonstrated by the

673
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:13,560
Rising fuel prices by the way it's on it sounds like you're actually sitting inside your fuel tank as we speak it's an awesome sound effect

674
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,600
Now what's happening a lot a lot of marginal

675
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,800
Operators are going out of business because they cannot

676
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:28,360
Forward the fuel only the strong the strongest companies are going to be able to survive this

677
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,520
Now

678
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,760
What the companies are doing they're starting to clamp down on their

679
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,840
Expenses

680
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:41,640
Mainland biggest one is a fuel yeah after fuel by the way comes people

681
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,280
In fact, I'd say that probably well that's because of specific to the transport business

682
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,880
But probably people is the number one expense in any organization so

683
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:56,360
As predicted this is going to cost jobs and livelihoods and it's going to weaken economies

684
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:04,120
Now the company the die drive for they they're slowing the trucks top speed down they do that by plugging a computer in and

685
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:11,000
Slow you know just setting the speed so now moderately literally slowing down the economy

686
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,560
Truck will go 62 it used to go 65

687
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,680
They're asking us to reduce the idle time to 10% now that's pretty much impossible

688
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,720
Because hey, I live in the truck

689
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,600
In order to stay cool or

690
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,440
Warm

691
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,320
I've got to idle the truck because my truck does not have what's called an alternate power unit

692
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:40,280
And so therefore I have to idle the truck as I am right now in order to stay cool right now. I'm in

693
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,160
Georgia

694
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,160
Area and it's kind of hot here

695
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,400
So I'm going to stay cool. They can gripe at me all they want but

696
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:56,920
I'm going to stay cool you can find all of my rants and other web 2.0 social goodness at

697
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,800
Trucker Tom podcast calm you and they work for us

698
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,840
Yeah, Tom. Thanks. Okay. That answered that. Let's see what this one's about

699
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:16,360
Last message was too long. Take two. Hi, I'm Mike. It's Mike. I live in northern California Bay area. I've noticed

700
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:22,520
After watching regular and diesel gas prices where I buy gas

701
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,760
That unlike a year or two ago where diesel was one to five percent less than regular

702
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:36,440
It's now 20 to 30 percent above the cost of regular gas. Exactly. This is what I'm trying to get some answers on

703
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:43,880
Why the hell has this stuff that used to be really really cheap now become more expensive than regular gasoline?

704
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:51,000
I just checked San Jose gas prices.com and in Gilroy which is about 50 miles south

705
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:57,320
Gas is $4 and 2 cents diesel is $5 and 25 cents. Here's my question

706
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,880
Maybe you can ask your petroleum savants

707
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:08,360
What's behind this recent significant difference between regular gas and diesel?

708
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,240
I have a suspicion it might be related to sweet crude

709
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,400
Which I think I read sweet crude is used primarily or is preferred for

710
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:27,880
Producing diesel fuel and sweet crude is very scarce. Wow, it's not amazing

711
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,120
I thought I was convinced that it had to do with like carbon emission taxes

712
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:37,640
You're telling me the actual basis of diesel was just gone up because sweet crude is so hard to get a hold on

713
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,200
I thought I mean I thought yeah, you can burn anything

714
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
You can burn anything you want to diesel you can almost poop in it the thing will run

715
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,000
That doesn't make any sense. Are they making diesel that's too clean?

716
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,160
Wow

717
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:59,320
Is sweet crude the issue for the diesel prices is that what China and India are buying for their

718
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:07,640
Significant you know build out oh wow. This is a great question. I'm glad you got a little bit deeper than I've been able to get okay. This is good

719
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,600
And then more maybe more importantly

720
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,560
Is the US government

721
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:20,920
Which is buying sweet crude to fill the strategic petroleum reserve is that are those purchases?

722
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,360
Actually forcing the price of diesel up and

723
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:33,000
If so what impact would it have if the US government suspended purchasing

724
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,480
sweet crude

725
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,680
in order to

726
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,320
Push down the price for a diesel

727
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,280
My understanding is the strategic reserve is at 98%

728
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:51,320
It's big but you know suspending it for you know six months

729
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,960
To bring them the price of diesel fuel if that's possible which certainly make a lot of sense

730
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,080
What are your savants think about that?

731
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,960
Hope you hear

732
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,880
More discussion around this thanks a lot. Well your time you could not have been any better because I've got the economics of bond

733
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,120
I think that economics of bond has an answer to this and it's been from a

734
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,720
Your economics on

735
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,720
I give you a quick hope

736
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,720
You're talking about gas taxes and

737
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:25,160
Got me thinking I'm actually driving back from the gas station right now just paid for 29

738
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,720
Oh, man, can you believe that you know I?

739
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,880
I filled up the Delta Shira in the Hilversum at Hilversum Airport since

740
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,680
Farrox has no fuel that literally out of fuel they've been out of fuel for four months

741
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,280
They can't afford to have a full fuel truck show up anymore

742
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,480
Okay, this is a busy airport

743
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,520
People have to fly to neighboring airports to get fuel

744
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:52,520
You know they can't operate the field anymore. I paid two euros fifty

745
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,720
For a leader

746
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,120
That's like ten bucks a gallon

747
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,640
So the car put in a little over fifty dollars in gas into my little infinity g twenty um

748
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,520
Getting rid of gas tax a little wouldn't do much good

749
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:15,160
Forers in the long run. I'm going to be able to get it here in California. I pay roughly sixty two cents a gallon in taxes

750
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,240
Some days pay a little 30 cents in total

751
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,160
18.2 18.3 cents that goes to the federal government now

752
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,480
Why this wouldn't do this any good is the vast majority of the funding for

753
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,880
I was bridges streets all that stuff that you drive your car around on comes from those gas taxes

754
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,800
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. All right

755
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,200
Is now what we paid tolls for aren't the tolls supposed to cover all that?

756
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,680
You can't tell me all bridges and all tunnels and stuff that that's just now possible

757
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,080
We paid tolls especially for the maintenance of that

758
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:55,400
You only get the cash tax you drive that's worth of funding almost completely and road tax don't we pay the license fee

759
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,360
Registration fees not a road tax kind of built in

760
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,800
Road deteriorate they're just fall down that things happen

761
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:09,400
Can't drive around gas tax is one of the few taxes. That's actually good tax in that the people who are generating the tax

762
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,720
So the people who are using the service the go-to-long with this not kind of like general tax

763
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:19,240
When you have where kind of the angle pot the pot comes out whenever home the more mild I drive more gas

764
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,560
I have to buy and more wear and tear and putting on the road

765
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,960
Of course, that's not entirely true

766
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,880
Diesel fuel is used in many aircraft these days

767
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,280
Diesel fuel is used in boats it's used in generators

768
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:40,760
Trucker Tom is burning diesel just to stay cool to stay warm. He's not using one one inch of road

769
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,320
Well, only the inch he's standing on

770
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:48,920
That's not entirely fair and by the way the European Union is working on changing

771
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,920
Tax not necessarily the gasoline tax but other special taxes they have on audible bills and

772
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,640
They're now more figured into a pay as you use tax which means

773
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,920
They get a little black box in their car, which tracks how many miles they actually drove

774
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,480
And then they get a bill at the end of the month for that usage

775
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,200
Which is all fine and dandy

776
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,200
If you're want the government to know exactly where you are at any given moment

777
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,840
Cranky

778
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,040
To maintain those roads and whatnot, so

779
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,320
What the hell's kind of explain things politicians like the float this is an idea kind of a populist type movement gets people fired up

780
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,680
Because I think oh what they're doing something for me, but yeah in all honesty when I'm seen for 30 a gallon

781
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,680
I'm not gonna know safety and sense

782
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,840
Gas is still expensive, but it's also still a really good deal

783
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,080
Especially here in the states

784
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,320
You're up all the other countries that tax it like there's no tomorrow at the different story

785
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,320
So that's what I got

786
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,520
Love you man

787
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,520
Stoomin it no mama all that jazz

788
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,160
And remember they work for us

789
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,840
Hell yeah

790
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,160
You know I was actually planning on playing something in

791
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,480
I had to make different at the end today

792
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:08,520
Which actually is about 11 minutes and length so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say that for tomorrow because it is quite beautiful and since we're on such a roll

793
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,520
I have one more

794
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,880
one more

795
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,760
Voice mail to play and by the way if you're looking for the voice mail numbers

796
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,120
I don't play the jingles anymore because they kind of got annoying and got on my nerves

797
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:23,080
But you can find him in the show notes a daily source code dot com listen to what our monetary scientists has to say

798
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,360
This is trace in San Diego the monetary scientists

799
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,720
I am a couple of a couple weeks have been traveling and I really get a friend of mine

800
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,160
Got no very bad car accident is a nice interview and

801
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,040
I spin in some time with him this man. I'm sorry to hear that man. No, it really fits

802
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,160
It's like in perspective so I hope all the truck loads are yeah, that'll do it too

803
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,360
Really cherish those relationships. They got

804
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,680
Anyways, I've heard a lot of talk on the

805
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,760
source code about the gas and a little prices and diesel

806
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,760
etc

807
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,120
All right, bring in home monetary scientists. Let's get some closure to this and

808
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,560
I'm actually going to be speaking on this topic at

809
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,720
Cambridge House is

810
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,600
2000 investment conference up in Vancouver

811
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:21,640
Excuse me. I mean, we don't just have any savants stop them by on the Charlie. You know our chuckle heads got some props got some rep got some background got some baggage

812
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:29,000
House.ca for more information. It's free to if you're through register with you to it and so any trip roads up there

813
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,440
Anyways, one of the big problems we've got with our oil and gas prices

814
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,600
is

815
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,840
In 1933 the securities act was passed which governed

816
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,400
Stocks and whatnot 1936 the

817
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:50,120
Commodity exchange act was passed creating the CFTC the commodity future trading commission

818
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:57,400
No, I want to I know it's kind of hard to hear but I want you to really focus I'm going to shut up I want to interrupt I want you to really listen to what he's saying

819
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,560
About this act that was created and who's really responsible for this rapid rise in the cost of oil

820
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,400
Pay attention

821
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,600
Yes, you see

822
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,600
Anyways, it's at rules about

823
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:14,440
Like who can invest in what and how much when it comes to wheat and oil and silver gold

824
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,840
And remember

825
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,840
Currents is only good for what it'll buy

826
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:25,640
So when we have this runaway spending by Congress and this carry trade with the Japanese yen

827
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,200
The loose lending standards by the Fed and when they bail out stuff like their sterns

828
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:37,640
Boeing bubble after bubble all the past monetary inflation and then the fractional reserve lending of our modern banking system

829
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,320
Of course the dollar

830
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:44,200
loses its purchasing power and it goes for all the occurrences rose in

831
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,680
British council whatever and

832
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,160
People with hold those they need to

833
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,520
Preserve their purchasing power so what do they do they want to buy real things like oil?

834
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:59,400
So now we've got tension funds that have 1.1 billion

835
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:05,160
barrels of oil in future contracts that they've bought and they keep rolling them over months to month

836
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,200
Anyways, there's a ton of capital that's starting to pour into commodities

837
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:20,120
We haven't even seen anything yet as far as what it could be and that's one of the things that's really feeling these price increases and you can't see it's a bubble because

838
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,320
The inventories are not

839
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,840
Being stocked up the oil's been consumed anyways run to gold dot com love your hair

840
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,840
Uh

841
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,840
To know home of

842
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,840
To good work man

843
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,840
Because you're writing a bank hard

844
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,840
And I really appreciate what you're doing

845
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:47,800
And thank you're keeping the contract and I feel unjustly and rich from benefiting so much from the show

846
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,520
Thank you so much buddy. It just under the three minute time limit too

847
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:59,160
Okay, so this is something I've I indeed have from other sources that it's really what's going on as you have these

848
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,200
Insurance companies now insurance companies have a you know, it's a very very simple business

849
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:10,760
They take your money they invest that money they get a certain return on it. They've all kinds of spreadsheets and models and they know what the

850
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,280
Percentages are chances and likelihood of you either

851
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,440
Getting into an accident hurting somebody breaking something

852
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,200
Dying your house burning down or

853
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,640
Losing your job or just getting horribly ill. You know this is or getting robbed

854
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,920
This is what they do and they calculate that premium

855
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:36,680
You know based upon who you are your risk profile, which I think is pretty much just made up at birth these days

856
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,600
And you know the way that against

857
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:45,080
You know how much have to pay out an insurance claims and you know by the way

858
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:50,120
They're always kind of tight on paying out. You gotta gotta gotta go to go through a lot of rig and we're all sometimes to

859
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:55,480
Get your money back from insurance company and so what they're doing is you know they're saying the other they're seeing the opportunity

860
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:01,480
They just want to make more money. That's what they do. These are some of the wealthiest companies in the world some of them of course

861
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,000
You know

862
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,760
Run into trouble when there's huge natural disasters, but they're pretty good at not paying out. I'd say in general

863
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,120
And they're they're making bank they're rolling it over there

864
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:18,040
You know, they have they fit within the regulation they can buy oil in fact

865
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:23,560
I understand that there's so much oil that there's now actually a shortage of tankers because the

866
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:29,640
tankers are literally sailing the seas with no particular destination no port to go to

867
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:35,080
They don't want to go to a port although kind of you know the layout and international water outside of a port

868
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:43,000
Ready to pounce to go in and offload their oil at the minute the cell order comes in. I mean there's actually a shortage of tankers because of this

869
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:48,840
And you know this is this is where the outrage should be this is people speculating

870
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:56,840
On on our economy, you know using our economy is collateral it's it's so wrong

871
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,720
Yeah, a lot of people are gonna get very very wealthy

872
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:08,360
Man, you know what I'm tired of it. I've been thinking about this for too long

873
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,880
But something's got a break something will break you watch when the price of gas goes up to about

874
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:20,840
67 bucks the shit's gonna hit the fan and then the price of oil will come down the dollar will go up and then we'll probably see

875
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,920
McCain

876
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,440
Elected president and then the stock market will she was shoot up and well, I don't know man

877
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:35,240
Then we'll probably need some kind of some other kind of a 9-11 like event to bring us back down to earth and to scare us all back in submission

878
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,000
You never know but rest assured. I'm gonna keep my eye on it

879
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,280
As will the rest of the chuckle has and if you're new to this show welcome to the family

880
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,880
So daily source code not always daily but always full of passion

881
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:25,800
Don't you let me live

882
00:56:39,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Turn it all out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it out, you say it

884
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:56,600
So here we are, missing me, in the eye we'll leave the ring

885
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:06,000
From the school, in the sun, dawn is one thing, and the chair must go on

886
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:17,000
To come on, oh, with the round of high, and to let me live

887
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Oh, and the reason that I'm dealing, I can't rely on, I'm tired, I'm tired
