00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sheriff Charley, 7-81

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,160
What's 6-year-living dollars worth of airborne, flies throbting my ass.

3
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,660
the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,160
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
I just did this very early.

6
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,160
The fight and sick girl, the status quo.

7
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,160
The real eyes we must make it go.

8
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,160
I have come here to tell you.

9
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,160
It's time to stand up and watch the corporate's fall.

10
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,160
At one time they're converting us.

11
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,160
Now they're converting us.

12
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,160
I'm thinking everything I'm gonna take.

13
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,160
Now it's time for us to break away today.

14
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,160
Don't ever let them take you away.

15
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,160
The same I never did today.

16
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,160
The cast held the truth cause it's classified.

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,160
The TV set keeps us classified.

18
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,160
The cast held the truth cause it's classified.

19
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,160
The TV set keeps us classified.

20
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,160
So now we're trapped in the lion's den.

21
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,160
Will it travel us over and over again?

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,160
Don't ever let them take you away.

23
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,160
The same I never did today.

24
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,160
Don't ever let them take you away.

25
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,160
You're only going to give up yourself.

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,160
The same I never did today.

27
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,160
Don't ever let them take you away.

28
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,160
The same I never did today.

29
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,160
Don't ever let them take you away.

30
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,160
The same I never did today.

31
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Hey, whoa, don't ever ever give a shot, you're only going to be so...

32
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Oh yeah, you like it heavy huh?

33
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,160
It's the free fall of fact right here on the Dating Source Code episode number 781 Chuck Hitz,

34
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,160
how you doing the Source Code is on.

35
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:50,160
Coming to you as always from the affluent suburb of Serino as Gilford.

36
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:57,160
We're here in the manner on the outskirts there of G-Town,

37
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,160
and boy it's good to talk to you guys.

38
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,160
I'm back once again.

39
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
It's good everything all squared away here.

40
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,160
It's so weird when you go away for a week and you take half the studio with you

41
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,160
and then you have to kind of rebuild and away that if I turn this down.

42
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
There you go.

43
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
That's better.

44
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
I thought I heard it.

45
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,160
Yeah, that's exactly what I heard.

46
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
Some feedback.

47
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
I've got to rebuild everything.

48
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
It seems like it's more or less together now.

49
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,160
So it is Tuesday today is the 19th of August 2008.

50
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Time really moving on.

51
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,160
We've got just horrible weather here for the past.

52
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
What is it?

53
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,160
Well, even since I got back, it's just been nasty weather.

54
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,160
In fact, it's been that way for a couple weeks, not just here, but globally weather is a little bit screwed up.

55
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,160
Call a global warming climate change if you will.

56
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,160
I think they just turned on the harp system up there in Alaska.

57
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:58,160
Let's see, we've got natural dam walls breaking in Colorado, the Grand Canyon.

58
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:09,160
We've got just unbelievably horrible weather high winds, thunderstorms, rain, vertical rain almost in parts of Europe.

59
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:16,160
And the Antarctic penguins are actually freezing to death from cold Arctic rain.

60
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
I mean, come on.

61
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
What's happening?

62
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Do you want to know what that reference was to harp?

63
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:29,160
Just look up, H-A-A-R-P, Hotel Alpha, Alpha Romeo, Papa.

64
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,160
The CT's out there.

65
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
That'll send you down a rabbit hole.

66
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,160
A lot of stuff to go through with you today, because obviously I haven't done well.

67
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,160
I did a no agenda over the weekend with John, but that doesn't take much preparation as much as you know.

68
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Just looking at the drop drop.io slash daily source code.

69
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Thank you very much.

70
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160
You put together a great show for me.

71
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,160
Top of the news without a doubt is of course still the conflict in Georgia.

72
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:05,160
And it's been interesting to, you know, and this is really what I love so much about where we're at with mainstream news and with the internet basically.

73
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,160
And I think I've tried, I finally figured out, we actually do need to work together.

74
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,160
But we don't have to do anything together because it's already happening automatically just organically almost.

75
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Because the real information, the true news that is going on out there in the world is actually being reported.

76
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,160
There are really good journalists in all walks of life, all types of publications.

77
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,160
The truth doesn't get through as an example.

78
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,160
And this is the thing that has just been fantastic to watch unfold before our very eyes.

79
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,160
You know, with the knowledge which has been widely reported, but it's not the headline.

80
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,160
It's not the top of the news.

81
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:54,160
What the agenda, it's not the talking point, is that Georgia attacked the peacekeeping troops and the civilians of South of Syria.

82
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
This is an unknown fact.

83
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
No one's disputing it.

84
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,160
But of course, the whole headline and what the news is about is, oh, Russian bad USA good.

85
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,160
Well, kick their ass, put missiles in Poland, put missiles in Cuba.

86
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:15,160
You know, it's like, you can call it Saber Radling, you can call it just thugs, bumping chests, essentially.

87
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:23,160
And it's not like we matter, no one gives a shit about us or the civilians, thousands of civilians that were killed during this recent conflict.

88
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,160
But the news is actually being reported.

89
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,160
And I think what is what we're seeing happen now is that you have aggregation sites.

90
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,160
And of course, these are, you know, people who want to prove a point or have an agenda, which is fine.

91
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:48,160
And you can now collect mainstream articles, which by definition, the reports, many of them do have credibility, many of these reporters are credible.

92
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,160
But it's really the editors and the DNA of these companies who decide what is going to be the topic of the day.

93
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,160
And that is just done through simple mind control we call media and advertising.

94
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
I mean, it's nothing new there.

95
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,160
You know, it's easy to make a, a number one hit record just give me enough budget.

96
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
You know, and give me access.

97
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Let me pay off the radio stations.

98
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,160
It still happens to this very day limit anything else and get through the, that can get through the funnel.

99
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
That's how hit records are made.

100
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:21,160
You know, it's not like there aren't any other good records out there, good music being made that couldn't be as popular as anything else.

101
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
It's number one.

102
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Now it's just the way it's the way this system works.

103
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
It's restrictive.

104
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,160
It's not inclusive of everybody.

105
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:36,160
So that's why the agenda, the real top of the news, you know, like important stuff in the world, like the Olympics.

106
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
That's going to get front page coverage.

107
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
You know, we've got a guy who's got eight gold medals.

108
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
That's front page coverage.

109
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Not about the true agenda of the world's elite or as I call them the energy elite.

110
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,160
So when you think about the new world order.

111
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,160
And you know, I know a lot of people are going to ask you had a new world order.

112
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
Here we go again.

113
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,160
It's kind of interesting when you get to aggregate all this fantastic news.

114
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
And it's not just reporting.

115
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
It's also interviews.

116
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,160
And this, and of course, my aggregation site is created by the chuckleheads.

117
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
Listen to the daily source code.

118
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
It's drop.io slash daily source code.

119
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,160
And of course, they also pop stuff over to curry.com.

120
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,160
You're really helping understand what this means.

121
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:29,160
And listen to Georgian president, Mikhail Sakashvili.

122
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,160
And this is on the Glenn Beck show.

123
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
So check this out for a second.

124
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
And you'll hear him say new world order.

125
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
He's calling for it.

126
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
Okay, so hold on.

127
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,160
I'm playing this directly from YouTube of hijacked the audio from the browser.

128
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,160
And of Georgia Mikhail Sakashvili.

129
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,160
Mr. President, quickly if we can, you speak very frankly.

130
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,160
And say things, I was listening to you last few minutes.

131
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,160
You don't hear a politician speak the way you do in America.

132
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
That's funny, by the way.

133
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,160
Glenn Beck, know you don't hear him talk like politicians in America.

134
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
It's just a different accent.

135
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
The bullshit is still the same.

136
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,160
You just lay all your cards down on the table.

137
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,160
This is you a couple of days ago under flat jackets.

138
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
You're being targeted.

139
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,160
Now you're standing on an open roof.

140
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,160
You know, if you haven't seen that, look that up on YouTube.

141
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Look up Sakashvili, look at him eating his tie.

142
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,160
There's a BBC documentary or documentary of peace and newspiece.

143
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
You see, he's so nervous this guy.

144
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,160
So wound up, he's sitting there while cameras are watching him.

145
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,160
He's eating his tie, which is just weird.

146
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,160
And then, like, he's outside and a plane flies over.

147
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,160
And he starts running, like, you know, just hysterically frightened.

148
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,160
So, you know, Glenn Beck is, you know, making a sound like a hero.

149
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,160
But if you look at the video, he's like, you know, pretty wussy.

150
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:00,160
I mean, I'm not saying that I would be any different in that situation.

151
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,160
But Glenn Beck made him sound a little bit too more, too heroish there.

152
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Anyway, so listen to what this guy is all about.

153
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:15,160
Do you believe that, um, do you believe that this will, and Russia will end if you are dead?

154
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
Nice posture, Glenn.

155
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Well, you know, it's not the fact that I was targeted.

156
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
My people has been targeted.

157
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
I couldn't care less whether I was targeted.

158
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,160
The worst thing was that I was standing there with my people.

159
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
They were bombed.

160
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
And I was just targeted like them.

161
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,160
And they selected president, official and charge of their protection.

162
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
I couldn't do anything about it.

163
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,160
But the one here is, it's not about me.

164
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
It's about the idea of freedom.

165
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Freedom.

166
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
It's about the future of the whole region.

167
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,160
It's about the future of Europe and a new world order.

168
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
There you go.

169
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,160
It's about freedom, the future of Europe and a new world order.

170
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
I don't know.

171
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,160
I don't like that idea of a new world order.

172
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,160
This was a George H. Bush's idea.

173
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,160
He said it first, the first time in American president, as far as I can recall,

174
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
said it really publicly that way.

175
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Like, it's a big idea.

176
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,160
It's the new world order.

177
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
And here he is.

178
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Here's your guy.

179
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Here's a George Jr. Bush's guy.

180
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
And Cheney's guy.

181
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
Talk about the new world order.

182
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,160
I don't want to have one set of rules and one government governing everything we do.

183
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,160
I don't want that.

184
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,160
I'd like the idea that countries are different.

185
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
It's kind of cool, you know.

186
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,160
It really is.

187
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,160
So another great thing about the medium that we have to work with,

188
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,160
my friends, is that we actually talked to people

189
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,160
in Georgia and in Russia, and they talk back.

190
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
Hello, Adam.

191
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
This is Dennis.

192
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,160
No, as Radio Greench.

193
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,160
By the way, you know, this is not about the people of any of these countries.

194
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:49,160
There's no way I hate an Iraqi or an Afghani, an Afghan.

195
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
That sounds like a dog.

196
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
Someone from Afghanistan.

197
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
I don't hate them.

198
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
I don't hate people from Iran.

199
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,160
It's beautiful.

200
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,160
People from Russia don't look as cute as the ones in Iran,

201
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
but they're just people.

202
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,160
It's these are thugs.

203
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
All of them.

204
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,160
All of the elite and their little puppet thugs who are the gangs.

205
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,160
And there's gangs everywhere in China in Russia.

206
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,160
In the United States in Europe.

207
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
There's lots of gangs in Europe.

208
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,160
And they're all muslim for power.

209
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
And, you know, we're just finally waking up to it.

210
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
We're seeing it.

211
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
The veil has been lifted.

212
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,160
And a lot of it is thanks to the Internet, which, of course, is next.

213
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
You know, that's what they're going to come after.

214
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
They've been trying for a while.

215
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
They're really going to go for it.

216
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
All right.

217
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,160
So our buddy from Russia here, the radio grid.

218
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,160
In Russian podcasting.

219
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
You're colleague, by the way.

220
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Yes.

221
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Anyway, I'm listening to your show.

222
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,160
I'm a little concerned for you because sometimes I know that people

223
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
want to grow old, they get into old.

224
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
Hey, hey, who are you calling old men?

225
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
Kind of conspiracy theories.

226
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Oh, that's bullshit.

227
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
There's even that.

228
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
There's no proof of that.

229
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
That's just me.

230
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
I think you're still healthy.

231
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
I'm not a doctor, but anyway,

232
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
you're right.

233
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,160
And I would like to thank you for speaking on behalf of Russia in the

234
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,160
situation related to Georgia situation.

235
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,160
Let's start it on the first day of Olympics.

236
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Western media sucks as bad as Russian media.

237
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
Exactly.

238
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
Oh, yeah.

239
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
In fact, media everywhere sucks because they're all in

240
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Kahuts.

241
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,160
But, you know, a lot of the people, you know, like you and I,

242
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,160
are also reporters and they're making reports and they're trying to get

243
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,160
the word out and they get a page five below the fold, you know.

244
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
And it's still the truth.

245
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
And it's still getting out there.

246
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
It's just not.

247
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
It's not where we're so mind-controlled.

248
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,160
I remember when my parents used to say, don't watch television all day

249
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,160
long.

250
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,160
It'll write your brain.

251
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
And it has.

252
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
It's rotted our brains.

253
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,160
So yeah, Western media, Eastern media sucks equal.

254
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
I agree.

255
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
So you can't really trust them.

256
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,160
But anyway, thanks for speaking on behalf of Russians.

257
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,160
I'm not saying again that we are good in this situation.

258
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:55,160
But we're not definitely as we're portrayed in the Western media.

259
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,160
You're no worse than we are.

260
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,160
Or the way what our government has done, you know, Iraq, Afghanistan.

261
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
All kinds of nastiness.

262
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Now, you know, I wonder what we're going to do next in Pakistan.

263
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Now that Basharraf is a man, we're kind of dealing with he get, huh?

264
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,160
He, he, I think he really, this guy's going to wind up dead if they don't

265
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,160
get him to the states if they don't take care of their boys.

266
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Because that's exactly, you know, Basharraf is total, total operative.

267
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
And he just didn't do a good job.

268
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:34,160
So I wonder if he, I wonder if he did this in in collaboration.

269
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
If he said, look, I got to get out of the situation.

270
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Or if he was told to leave or it'll be interesting.

271
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
Let's see who jumps in that slot next.

272
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,160
That'll tell us a lot about the plans for Pakistan.

273
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160
Okay. And you know that.

274
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
And you're right about that.

275
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
This whole thing is all about the oil.

276
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
You're right about that.

277
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Yeah, and the pipeline, the gas.

278
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,160
Obviously Europe, you know, and Europe is in the hardest position right now.

279
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Because they want and they need Russian gas.

280
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,160
And the US is poking them with a stick.

281
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
That's what's going on.

282
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
Oil and gas.

283
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
There's no doubt about it.

284
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,160
So anyway, Adam, I just wanted to thank you for your show.

285
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:20,160
And I would like to tell you, like, there's a situation that needs clarification from maybe someone from inside of Russia.

286
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,160
Don't hesitate to email me and ask your questions.

287
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,160
And if I have answers for those, I'll give you those.

288
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,160
If I don't, I'll find people who might have those.

289
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
All right, man, I appreciate it.

290
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:39,160
And of course, if you're in Georgia, I'm not familiar with any Georgian podcast,

291
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
but it's such a western, westernized country.

292
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,160
I would presume that you can give us some details on what's going on from your end.

293
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
I'd love to hear about it.

294
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
Email, voicemail.

295
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,160
And by the way, I'm going to start phasing out the regular voicemail phone lines.

296
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,160
And just trying to keep it all on the on the drop because it's just so much more convenient.

297
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
And a lot of people are starting to use it now.

298
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,160
It's a kind of a downer because you got to use a pain code once you call in.

299
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,160
And that if anything, I'd love to have the folks over drop.au,

300
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
make that a direct phone line.

301
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,160
I mean, I'm paying for it with J2.

302
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Yeah, J2 facts or whatever.

303
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
I'd be happy to pay for it.

304
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,160
Just to have a direct line straight in.

305
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,160
Because you can kind of mean to what a great system that is.

306
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,160
You can categorize everything by media type or by a blog view.

307
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
I love it.

308
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
It's very, very cool.

309
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Although I've been having some problem with the pictures.

310
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
Pictures that are uploaded.

311
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,160
If you click them, then you don't get the pop up screen.

312
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Something's going on.

313
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Now those, you know, they're in data, whatever.

314
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
So they're working on it.

315
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,160
And here's nobody who stopped by the drop and left this message.

316
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Adam, what's up?

317
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
It's Kevin Reeves going in.

318
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Kevin Reeves?

319
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
One time to talk, buddy.

320
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
Yeah, man.

321
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:56,160
First of all, let me just say congratulations on this great awakening.

322
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,160
The show has gone in a great direction.

323
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:06,160
I too have been on a interesting journey in the past four years as far as

324
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
way to do these kind of things.

325
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:15,160
With the help of my friend and colleague, Ian Beard, who is just provided me with a wealth of information,

326
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:21,160
which completely lines up and corroborates with what you say and with Alex Jones.

327
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,160
And it's just unbelievable how all the pieces just fit in the place.

328
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,160
You know, and this is funny because this is what I'm witnessing as well.

329
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,160
All the things, all the people that, you know, I was kind of taught and brought up to think,

330
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
you know, they're weird.

331
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,160
You know, not like hippy, weird, but just, you know, on the fringe off the edge.

332
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,160
You know, there's lots of troubled people in the world and that's one of them.

333
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,160
You know, so now obviously I recognize that I've turned into one of them.

334
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,160
But it's really because those people were awake and there've been people have been awake for a long, long time,

335
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,160
and have really seen what's, you know, you know, you know, like you've always got that grumpy uncle,

336
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
who's always sitting around reading the paper and going like,

337
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,160
God, damn these bastards, you know, how can they be, it's like kind of like the kid from Brooklyn,

338
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
right?

339
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,160
Who see through it, who can see with such clarity and see what's going on.

340
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:12,160
I've had many people in my life throughout the years, even in recent years,

341
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
who have been like this.

342
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:20,160
And you know, and I remember Ben Cohen, one of my, one of my big influences in life.

343
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,160
I remember when George Bush senior became president and then I can remember sitting in this living

344
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,160
going, hey, he seems like a pretty cool guy.

345
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,160
He'll be a big good dude for the American for the state and for the world.

346
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
And he looked at me and said, are you kidding me?

347
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,160
That guy is the biggest crook there is.

348
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
And I remember sitting there going, huh?

349
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,160
No, we're talking about man.

350
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
This guy's good.

351
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
Listen to him.

352
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,160
He means that he wants to hook up, hook us up with China and make good.

353
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,160
And I think a lot of this, of course, is once they cast George W. Bush and put him in the,

354
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,160
acting role of president.

355
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,160
You know, that was, I mean, they really chose the wrong actor at that point.

356
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
That was that guy's just he's the wrong guy.

357
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
And that's when the crack started to show.

358
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,160
And of course, you know, they couldn't do much, but leave him for all eight years.

359
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Because it's all, it's all bought and paid for.

360
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
It's all set up.

361
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
It's all, it's all one big show.

362
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
It's a big show.

363
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,160
As I've always said, politics is show business for ugly people.

364
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
And we're, no offense.

365
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,160
But we're, we're, we're realizing that.

366
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,160
And now that that veil was starting to lift off, things just like a puzzle start to click into place.

367
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,160
So good on your body for this.

368
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
This is great.

369
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,160
The show is so much now more so than it ever was before about community.

370
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,160
And communicating something and trying to dialogue and open up a conversation.

371
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,160
So this is an awesome incredible.

372
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
About girls I have.

373
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,160
Now he launches in this whole long thing, which I'm not going to play for.

374
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:07,160
That was, we were talking about about women and how they have such a horrible self image of themselves.

375
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,160
Also thanks to the media, by the way.

376
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,160
That's, you know, that also is a form of mind control.

377
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,160
Whereas, you know, first of all, we're happy we get anything.

378
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,160
If we get attention, not even talking sex, just attention.

379
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,160
We love that.

380
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,160
And you know the game.

381
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,160
But anyways, Kevin launched into like a full another minute of that.

382
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,160
And I got so much I got to move on today.

383
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:41,160
Because this is, it's, I've really, I got to tell you, I'm feeling so incredibly positive about all of this new information,

384
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:46,160
opening up, all of us starting to, to see things, to start to put things into perspective.

385
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,160
And that's really, that's the most important part is just that we're realizing what's going on.

386
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,160
And talking about it because that does make change.

387
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
Look at the FBI.

388
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:01,160
They now have to come, you know, there's been so much questioning about this Bruce Ivan's,

389
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:09,160
so-called suicide of the anthrax terrorist that they now have to show their, you know, their full evidence.

390
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,160
And oh, gee, isn't that a shame.

391
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,160
They actually destroyed some of the evidence.

392
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,160
Yeah, well, we thought it wouldn't stand up in court anyway.

393
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,160
So we decided to destroy the evidence.

394
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Oh, come on.

395
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,160
So, you know, when this gets talked about a certain point, so many people are talking about it,

396
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,160
then it becomes a slug on the news.

397
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,160
And then it becomes a little joke there.

398
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,160
And another little chunk, chunk in the arm, a little bit of piece to the arsenal of,

399
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,160
of the bullshit that we're being fed day in, day out.

400
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,160
Now, you have, of course, we didn't do a footballer Friday.

401
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,160
And I apologize to many of you.

402
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,160
Some of you called in and said, hey, man, I had an 11 hour trip back to school.

403
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,160
And I was really jones and for a footballer Friday and the no agenda.

404
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
Well, I got you halfway there.

405
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,160
And I've got part of the footballer Friday for you right now.

406
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,160
I'm proud of you casting with Adam Curry.

407
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,160
This is the head of the test.

408
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,160
Get it, test.

409
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
Don't pull that.

410
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
Hey, Adam.

411
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
He's got this number 134.

412
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,160
I'm going to start right away with intro number one.

413
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,160
Okay.

414
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,160
I don't know.

415
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,160
This is like, and I wanted those 90s hit tests, right?

416
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
No, absolutely nothing.

417
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
Okay.

418
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,160
I don't know this one.

419
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
That's for sure.

420
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
Number two.

421
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,160
That's, um, that is Jocelyn Brown.

422
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Oh, it's like always, always be there.

423
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Something Jocelyn Brown.

424
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
I'm pretty sure of that.

425
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,160
And this is number three.

426
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
Stereo MCs.

427
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
I don't know the title.

428
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
But I recognize this sound.

429
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,160
This is like 92 or something like that.

430
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
This is not my strongest years.

431
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
I was way too consumed with myself.

432
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
It's time for the answers.

433
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
And this week they're all from...

434
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
I didn't even know what.

435
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,160
That was a good hit test.

436
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Hey!

437
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Hey!

438
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
Hey!

439
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,160
And this is answer number one.

440
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,160
This is Johnny Gordon.

441
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,160
We know I'll be there this time.

442
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,160
I would not have known that.

443
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,160
We know I'll be there this time.

444
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,160
I know I can't just be there.

445
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,160
We'll be there this time.

446
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,160
I know I can't just be there.

447
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,160
I'm going to get you baby.

448
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,160
I'm going to get you baby.

449
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,160
Baby.

450
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
I'm going to get you baby.

451
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
I'm going to get you baby.

452
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,160
I'm going to get you baby.

453
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
Great.

454
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
I'm just going to number one.

455
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Lonnie Gordon and gonna get you.

456
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,160
And this is answer number two.

457
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Incagnito featuring Jocelyn Brown.

458
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Yo, this is always there.

459
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
There you go.

460
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,160
I'm just feeling...

461
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,160
I remember this from Ray Brady.

462
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
Yo, I want to be...

463
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,160
Yeah.

464
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
Always there.

465
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Always there.

466
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
To raise you all again.

467
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
With not me.

468
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
Always there.

469
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
So not you.

470
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Always there.

471
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
To keep all.

472
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
Always there.

473
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
Always there.

474
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
Yeah.

475
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
Yeah.

476
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
Always there.

477
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,160
Always there.

478
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160
Yeah.

479
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Incagnito was answer number two.

480
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,160
And this is answer number three.

481
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,160
The lost in music.

482
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
Lost in music.

483
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,160
The stereo MCs.

484
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,160
You see.

485
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
Yeah.

486
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,160
This is lost in music.

487
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
There you go.

488
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,160
I got that one.

489
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,160
There's wrong one.

490
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
I got that one.

491
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
I got the new one.

492
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
My name goes wrong.

493
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,160
Yeah.

494
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
The blue box.

495
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
They look like ground.

496
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
You're lost in music.

497
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,160
Never too.

498
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
But.

499
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
Oh, those guys still.

500
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,160
I got it.

501
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,160
I got it.

502
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,160
I lost in music.

503
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,160
This is a compression on that.

504
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,160
The stereo MCs and lost in music is answer number three.

505
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
And that's it.

506
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,160
That's it for hit test number 134.

507
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,160
So Adam, how did you do this week?

508
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,160
I did four stars out of possible six.

509
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
You're on XM surprise.

510
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,160
We're being a 90's hit test.

511
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
Thank you for the challenge.

512
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,160
I would say.

513
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
The usual place to find the answers to the hit test.

514
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
And also the links to iTunes.

515
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,160
You can buy this right.

516
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Featured on the hit test.

517
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,160
Online is hit test of mepeo.com.

518
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
Thank you for playing.

519
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,160
Adam.

520
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
Thank you for listening.

521
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Next week.

522
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
I'll be back for another hit test.

523
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
So until then.

524
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
Take care.

525
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,160
Have fun.

526
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
No prize or you remember,

527
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,160
think with your hearts.

528
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,160
Bye, bye.

529
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:21,160
Amen.

530
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
Challenging the brain.

531
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,160
It's hard, man.

532
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,160
Because I was doing I was not into the.

533
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
Brilliant to the music scene.

534
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
It was...

535
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,160
It was.

536
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,160
It's the American music scene in 91.

537
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,160
And I was at the time for very different from these songs.

538
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,880
I did do a show called Ray radio, a radio show.

539
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,160
And Ronald Molondike would always send me these mixes.

540
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,760
This is when I was beta testing pro tools at the time.

541
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,920
I was like one of the first radio uses of pro tools,

542
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,360
which is really intended for studio work.

543
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,720
And we're doing that with that tapes,

544
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,880
and oh man, remember those kids, that tapes?

545
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,880
So part of this whole media controlled mainstream media,

546
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,880
as of course, meant to dumb us down to narrow our focus, narrow our vision.

547
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,880
And the Americans, of course, are the best example.

548
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,280
And you see the test on all the time, go ask any average American.

549
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,480
So I'm seemingly very simple worldview question,

550
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,280
and they usually fail.

551
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,280
So at least it's fun to edit the failing ones into the piece.

552
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,680
And this showed up on the drop.

553
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,680
Drop.io slash daily source code.

554
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Man, that's something wrong with the bandwidth here,

555
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,680
at the manner for some reason.

556
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,480
Something's really slowing things down.

557
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,880
Hold on, let me just see.

558
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,480
What's going on?

559
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,880
Let me just check.

560
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,480
Maybe if I just reload the page.

561
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,680
This is harsh in my mellow.

562
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,880
Okay, come on.

563
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,680
Here we go.

564
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
This is from the telegraph.

565
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,280
British anti-Americanism based on misconceptions.

566
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,280
Now, first of all, I live over here,

567
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,280
and I don't feel any anti-Americanism.

568
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,080
Maybe people who don't want to do business with us

569
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,480
or just don't order anything.

570
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,880
Maybe that's anti-Americanism, but I don't feel it.

571
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,880
In fact, as I say, we all, the people of the world

572
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,680
get along just fine.

573
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,680
However, British attitudes says this article towards the United States

574
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,080
are governed by ignorance of the facts on key issues such as crime,

575
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,080
healthcare, and foreign policy, according to a new survey.

576
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,280
So I thought it'd be kind of fun to read down some of the results

577
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,980
of this survey, a poll commissioned by America in the world

578
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,880
and independent pressure group that launches that, I guess,

579
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,080
launched on Monday, aims to improve understanding

580
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,280
and appreciation of the US and Britain and around the world.

581
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,960
We wanted to find out how British people understood

582
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,360
American found that there was an unbalanced view.

583
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,560
So you brits pay attention.

584
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,360
This'll be fun.

585
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,860
The survey showed a majority agreed with the false statement

586
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,260
that since the Second World War, the US has had more often

587
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,560
cited with non-Muslims when they had conflict with Muslims.

588
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,060
Wrong.

589
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,860
In fact, the 11 out of 12 major conflicts between Muslims

590
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,060
and non-Muslims and Muslims and secular forces

591
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,860
or Arabs and non-Arabes, the US has cited with the former group.

592
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,060
Is conflicts included Turkey, Greece, Bosnia, and Yugoslavia

593
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,360
and Kosovo and Yugoslavia.

594
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,060
As to if it was true that from 1973 to 1990,

595
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,860
the United States sold Saddam Hussein more than a quarter

596
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,360
of his weapons, 80% of British responded said,

597
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:41,160
yes, however, survey shows the US sold just 0.46%

598
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:46,360
of Saddam's arsenal to him compared to Russia's 57%.

599
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,060
Francis 13% and China's 12%.

600
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,760
That'll teach you.

601
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,060
I didn't know that.

602
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,560
I would have gotten that one wrong.

603
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,560
Uh, let's see.

604
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,460
Almost a third of Britain's believe that Americans who have not paid

605
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,260
their hospital fees or insurance premiums

606
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,160
are not entitled to emergency medical care

607
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,560
by loss, such treatment must be provided.

608
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
And more than half the respondents believe

609
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,960
that polygamy is legal in some US states,

610
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,660
while it is illegal in all US states.

611
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,060
And most Britons were unaware of positive aspects

612
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,060
of the US such as the robust environmental movement.

613
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,260
Huh?

614
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,460
Or the social justice work of evangelical churches.

615
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,960
Interesting.

616
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,360
Now, of course, Americans can't find Britain on the map.

617
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,060
And also, the reason why the Brits can actually

618
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,860
find the US on the map is because it's so damn big.

619
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,060
But we're kept dumb.

620
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,760
That's what it is.

621
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,260
I can see it.

622
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,760
I can see what these kids are being taught in school.

623
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,260
I can see with my own daughter.

624
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,560
And she hears stuff.

625
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,060
She hears Patricia and I talk about stuff.

626
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,760
She's always interested.

627
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,360
Like, wow, it's amazing.

628
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,560
I never heard about that.

629
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,960
I didn't know that.

630
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,360
And more increasingly, I might say,

631
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,160
I'm quite happy to report that often she says,

632
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,560
yeah, I read about that on the internet.

633
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,160
Thank you.

634
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,560
There you go.

635
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,360
Something for the Brits as well in about a week's time

636
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,860
we're kicking off a real special GoDaddy campaign.

637
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,960
We're going to have the best deal anywhere in the UK on dot code

638
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,560
that UK domain names.

639
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,060
And I'm very excited about it.

640
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,260
We're going to have a lot of shows working really hard

641
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,560
to bring this offer to you.

642
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,560
And we've worked with GoDaddy.

643
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,860
They have their own dedicated site.

644
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,860
It's all going to be in pounds.

645
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,860
And you'll see it's, of course, the major discounts

646
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,960
for dot com and dot net addresses as well.

647
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,160
It's at trend dot EU or dot TV or whatever we got.

648
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,860
But specifically dot code, I UK.

649
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,860
And you will not be able to be this price.

650
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,460
That's coming in about a week from now.

651
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,660
Let's see the BBC reports.

652
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,660
A US bank is bound to fail within months.

653
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,260
Yeah, I'd say so.

654
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,760
I'd probably say that would be Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

655
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:04,260
But it could even be one of the non-tax payer back banks.

656
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,560
I mean, it's just really hitting the fan.

657
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,360
It's almost like we're being distracted to go look at what's

658
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,560
happening in Russia and make sure that we pay attention

659
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,360
to the Olympics.

660
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,960
And anything, please don't look at what actually

661
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,360
is happening.

662
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,160
And as Lindsey Williams predicted, oil looks like it's

663
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,360
going to go down to $50 right now today.

664
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,760
It's at 1111.

665
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,060
So how does that happen?

666
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,960
And by the way, no one's talking about speculators now.

667
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Are they?

668
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,760
Well, it can only be that this was either speculation

669
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,360
or pure manipulation of the price at the source,

670
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,760
which is what Lindsey Williams has always proclaimed.

671
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,360
So any else as a gold will be down.

672
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,460
Gold is now what, under $800.

673
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,260
And the intent is to bankrupt Saudi Arabia.

674
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,160
Well, that's going to work.

675
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,960
And of course, the dollar's going up a little bit,

676
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,460
but you may not have noticed that in all this confusion

677
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,860
and a lot's been going on since the seventh of August

678
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,060
and the invasion in Georgia, that an extra $50 billion

679
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:11,260
of currency was bought up by foreign investors,

680
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,660
foreign banks, you can just say it's the foreign central banks

681
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,660
and bought more US debt.

682
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,260
So there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes

683
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,660
that's propping up the dollar.

684
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,260
And whenever you hear financial programs,

685
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,860
like I love listening to the CNN like hourly update,

686
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,060
there's a podcast version of it.

687
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:34,260
You can find it on my channel'satom.mevio.com

688
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,660
on my on the go channel.

689
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,160
I forget which you can subscribe to by the way

690
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,860
with any way you want with an RSS feed or whatever.

691
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,260
Just go with the name of the CNN show.

692
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,060
It's like market headlines or something.

693
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,660
And whenever you hear a financial guy,

694
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,060
like clearly a guy from the pit or some trader,

695
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,860
and he said, well, yeah, this is the bottom.

696
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,860
This is totally the bottom.

697
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,060
This thing is going up from here.

698
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,660
The dollar is on, it's on the rise again.

699
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,260
You've got to go get yourself some dollars.

700
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,060
Whenever someone's saying that you know

701
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,760
that you've got to go the opposite direction,

702
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,960
you know that's a sales pitch.

703
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,760
So they're not stupid.

704
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,960
They know it's all about to come crumbling down.

705
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,360
There was another.

706
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,860
Where is that?

707
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,760
Well, Dr. Doom, I'll get to him later.

708
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,060
I just want to stay with Britain for a second.

709
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,360
This was great.

710
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,760
This is from the telegraph.

711
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,360
How big brother watches your every move?

712
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,760
You know, ever growing surveillance society,

713
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,760
the average Britain is being recorded 3,000 times a week.

714
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,660
3,000 times a week.

715
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,360
And that's telephone, emails, web surfing,

716
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,360
swiping of a card, click of a mouse, cameras everywhere.

717
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,160
And no one's up in arms about it.

718
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,160
Either they're putting something in the water here,

719
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,760
or you know, everyone's just hammered all day well.

720
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
I guess that's true.

721
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,360
People are pretty much hammered all day long.

722
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,160
Maybe, you know, maybe it's the, it's the chem trails.

723
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,960
I don't know what it is.

724
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,460
Maybe it's harpsing an ultra low frequencies.

725
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,460
But man, we aren't brain dead over here.

726
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,960
I can feel it too.

727
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,360
I can absolutely feel the low energy, low vibrations.

728
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,360
And I had been away for a while

729
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,560
and it was very different in San Francisco.

730
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,960
It really was.

731
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,760
It wasn't, it was a higher frequency level.

732
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,360
There was just more positivity,

733
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,560
something in the air.

734
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,360
And there's something, it, it almost feels like this,

735
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,960
you know, like someone switched on a transmitter almost.

736
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,560
And it's just bringing you down,

737
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,160
which is why I talk about harp.

738
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,760
Yeah, another one from over here.

739
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,160
This is from the business times.

740
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,860
Yeah, this is a part of the terror act,

741
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,360
which is, but now being used.

742
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,960
So you, and now constables or cops on the streets,

743
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,560
excuse me, I just need a sip of tea there.

744
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,760
Cops on the street.

745
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,260
They can invoke, what does it, like rural,

746
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:11,160
a section 44, I think it is of the, of the counterterrorism bill.

747
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,060
And they can actually prohibit you from filming anything

748
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,360
on the street at their discretion.

749
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:22,160
So there's an uproar, as this article says,

750
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,760
to plan to hold inquests in secret now,

751
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,160
and I'm not quite sure the procedure of an inquest,

752
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,960
but I think it's obviously questioning

753
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,960
and researching to someone who's suspected of crime.

754
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,560
And so here's the story in quest

755
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,960
that are deemed a risk, too,

756
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,560
of course, national security by the government

757
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,760
would be held in secret in future under proposed powers

758
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,360
to come before the House of Lords this autumn.

759
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,960
The provisions under a clause in the counterterrorism bill,

760
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,460
that's kind of our Patriot Act over here in the UK,

761
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,960
allow the home secretary to stop a jury being summoned,

762
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,560
replace a corner with a government appointee

763
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,560
and bar the public from inquest if it is deemed to be

764
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,360
in the public interest, which means, you know,

765
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,760
basically just as serving behind closed doors

766
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,360
and, you know, no checks and balances on it.

767
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,160
Whew, we're just brain dead.

768
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,460
We're just slowly ebbin away,

769
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,760
paying lots of attention to David Beckham.

770
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
That's what we're doing.

771
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,760
House Beckham doing over there in LA galaxy.

772
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,160
Watching the Olympics.

773
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,960
Nothing to see here.

774
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,760
Move right along, please.

775
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,960
Here's bad news.

776
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,760
If that wasn't bad, this is really bad news.

777
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,460
Um, this is from the inquire.

778
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:50,060
Now, looks certain that the RIA and its tame political puppets

779
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,060
will kill off web radio.

780
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:57,560
This comes through Pandora who under the new payment scheme,

781
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,960
which I believe is retroactive,

782
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,460
will have to pay 70% of his projected revenue of $25 million

783
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,960
to keep the RIA or in this case,

784
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,560
its government appointed monopoly in forces,

785
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,560
sound exchange, off its back.

786
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,560
Small webcasters claim that demand,

787
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,460
the demanded dosh, that's Britspeak from money,

788
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,860
would be 100 to 300% of annual revenue,

789
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,760
which sound exchange, of course, believes is fair.

790
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,260
So there you go, that's pretty much over.

791
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,560
And what's so nuts about it is so why you've got,

792
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,160
you know, and of course they're playing licensed music,

793
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,860
which is the whole problem.

794
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,060
And so, well, and, you know,

795
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,060
and they're just trying to put together cool playlists,

796
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,860
and they're, you know, and put rich full 24, 7 radio stations

797
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,060
on the air, which I think, you know,

798
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,560
it could be good, and no one's willing not to pay,

799
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,060
you know, it's like, you know,

800
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,560
the web radio streaming guys want to pay,

801
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,060
they just want to pay a fair amount,

802
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,060
because it's just what the business, you know,

803
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:57,060
the business just isn't delivering on the cash.

804
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,560
Which, of course, you know, the whole fact that the RIAs

805
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,060
doing this means that they've really researched it,

806
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,060
and they know that this business model

807
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:08,060
will not work anyways, not going to mean a lot of money.

808
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,060
Therefore, that they might as well kill it,

809
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,560
because they don't want their shit floating out there.

810
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,060
And, you know, if they, if they knew if it worked,

811
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,560
they'd already be doing it.

812
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,060
But what's crazy about it is if you got the Podsate Music Revolution,

813
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,560
and now we've got guys like George Clinton,

814
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,560
you, as surely you've heard of him,

815
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,560
who, you know, is totally gets it,

816
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,560
which is like, all right, you know,

817
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,560
I'm going to sign this license,

818
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,560
which I have the right to, because I owe my shit,

819
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,560
and I'm going to let anyone who wants to put this in their show,

820
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,560
and their podcast, no matter how it's distributed,

821
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,560
I'm going to let them use it,

822
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,560
just tell me that you played it,

823
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,560
and I'll figure out how to make some money from it,

824
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,560
and I'm good enough.

825
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,560
So, let's listen to that then.

826
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,560
The alternative way of doing it.

827
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,560
George Clinton ain't that particular.

828
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,560
I'm a killer, I mean of course.

829
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,560
I'm a killer, I mean of course.

830
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,560
I'm a killer, I need to do it.

831
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
I need to do it.

832
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
I need to do it.

833
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
I need to do it.

834
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,560
I need to do it.

835
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,560
I need to do it.

836
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:16,560
You do, you do, you do, too.

837
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:23,560
You do me raw, but I'm still crazy about ya.

838
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,560
Then wait too long and I can't do without ya.

839
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,560
Have no choke, you know.

840
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,560
He's hurt, makes my love stronger than any more

841
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,560
I know from the way, but how can love

842
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,560
No pain, pain, no pain

843
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,560
No pain, no joy

844
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,560
Can be, can be, can be

845
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,560
Can be, can be

846
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,560
Can be, can be, can be

847
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,560
Can be, can be

848
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,560
Can be, can be, can be

849
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,560
But not so much to know, it's a baby that I know

850
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,560
The baby won't say, the baby won't do it right

851
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,560
But it's not a big lie

852
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,560
And the little boat came along me

853
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,560
Make all your recipe, true

854
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,560
To make love better, no

855
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,560
I do love, make love stronger than any more

856
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,560
I know, from the way, can be

857
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,560
Can be, can be, can be

858
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,560
Can be, can be

859
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:08,560
Can be, can be,

860
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
Can be, can be, can be

861
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,560
Can, can be, can be

862
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,560
Can be, can be, can be

863
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,560
Can be, can be, can be

864
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,560
Can be, can be, can be

865
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,560
Can, can be, can be

866
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Can be, can be

867
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
Can be, can be, can be

868
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
Can be, can be, can be

869
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,560
Can be, can be, can be

870
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,360
I know there's all the less to each

871
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,960
I know there's all the less to each

872
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,960
I know there's all the less to each

873
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,960
I know there's all the less to each

874
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,960
I know there's all the less to each

875
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,960
I know there's all the less to each

876
00:42:52,960 --> 00:43:21,160
I know there's all the less to each

877
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:44,160
You know, it's because I didn't take my walk yet, that's why.

878
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Yeah, you normally take that walk around the block and then, hey, just do some more there, will ya?

879
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,160
Excellent.

880
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,160
I'm going to take one right up for the show.

881
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,160
George Clinton named that peculiar featuring Sly Stone and Elba Orange.

882
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,160
Always one of those guys we're doing.

883
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,160
Here's your answer.

884
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,160
Nice.

885
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,160
Lay back and mellow.

886
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:23,160
I think I've mentioned this next story.

887
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,160
I just want to make sure it stays out there and I'm going to put a link.

888
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:33,160
In fact, I've been pretty good with a new production system because Drop.au makes it really simple for me for a number of reasons.

889
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,160
I've been pretty good with the links and the show notes.

890
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,160
I just want to make sure that I keep this book the way of the world in focus.

891
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:47,160
The book written by four of that Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.

892
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,160
Ron Susskind.

893
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,160
I think it's Susskind.

894
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:59,160
And, you know, this basically is the proof that would allow the impeachment of a large, well, George Bush and Dick Cheney for sure.

895
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,160
But could put a lot of people in jail including those guys.

896
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,160
And it needs to stay out there and you've got to read this book and you've got to hear his interview.

897
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,160
There's an interview with him on Democracy Now.

898
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,160
If you don't know what I'm talking about, I'll just read the blurb here.

899
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:18,160
The way of the world, Ron Susskind, on how the Bush administration deliberately faked an Iraq al-Qaeda connection

900
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,160
and undermined diplomacy, democracy in Pakistan and Iran.

901
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,160
Does that say enough for you?

902
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,160
Do you think it's worth checking out?

903
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,160
I think so.

904
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,160
See, I was going to, I'll put this link in the show notes about Dr. Doom.

905
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:44,160
Even though I won't go into a two-death, but this is, if you want some really good analysis about what's happening with the monetary meltdown that we're witnessing before our very eyes.

906
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:51,160
Good piece in the New York Times about the Sky Nuryo Rubini and a economics professor at New York University.

907
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:58,160
And in 2006, he was predicting exactly what started to take place about a year ago and he's got plenty more predictions.

908
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,160
Now this guy is, you know, is speaking circuit. He's everywhere. He's the new Messiah.

909
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:10,160
And it's not that hard to see, you know, in the next, you wait, you'll start hearing about derivatives.

910
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,160
Okay.

911
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:18,160
I know a lot about derivatives. I help build a, actually, our think-new ideas.

912
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,160
Our company built a Java based back in the day when it was Java.

913
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,160
I was, I think it was Java on the client.

914
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:37,160
I don't remember any more, but it was a derivatives trading desk, which was web based and we built that for bankers trust, which was bought and doesn't exist anymore.

915
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,160
And those guys that had a huge problems with derivatives, huge exposure.

916
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:52,160
And I think that the global derivatives deals that are out there of which only 2% or some ridiculously low number is actually covered with any real asset.

917
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,160
And that's why it's called a derivative because it's a little piece of a chunk of it's, you know, all these deals are,

918
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:08,160
tidying a cash flows and once that starts to slow down a mess up the system, but the total value, I believe is around 400,000 billion.

919
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:14,160
All right. So a billion is a thousand million and that 400,000 times.

920
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:20,160
And when that shit comes unglued, then it's, you know, everyone head for the hills.

921
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:30,160
Don't head for the coastal waters. I heard John C. to War Act talking about this on tech five of all places about the so called dead zones. You've got to read this article.

922
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,160
Dead zones and coastal waters are regions of ocean floors so deprived of oxygen.

923
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:43,160
The most marine life cannot survive and they're spreading worldwide and the alarming pace scientists say.

924
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:53,160
Diving the trend or nitrogen and phosphorus and phosphorus from chemical agricultural fertilizers that reach coastal waters after flowing off of farm fields and into rivers and streams.

925
00:47:53,160 --> 00:48:04,160
So this is these dead zones where it's just water, right, but it's just wet it's there's nothing growing nothing feeding nothing nothing nothing swimming except us idiots, of course.

926
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:17,160
A couple of these dead zones, biggest one measures about 30,000 square miles that's 80,000 square kilometers in the Baltic Sea, followed in size by one in the Gulf of Mexico starting at the mouth of the Mississippi River in the states.

927
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:23,160
And one of the mouth of China, China's young, say, River in the East China Sea.

928
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,160
Damn man. We're messing that up.

929
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:38,160
How are we doing on time? You know, these shows are long doing less of the shows, but I'm making them longer. I'm not hearing anybody complain, so I'm just going to presume that it's okay.

930
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:44,160
Yes, I know what it's time for. It's time for another episode of the soundtrack my life. Here's Ray on the Charlie.

931
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:54,160
Let's take a look at the landscape on a road trip through your life.

932
00:48:54,160 --> 00:49:01,160
This episode of Anchorage, the soundtrack to my life brings us back to 2002.

933
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:14,160
And it was 38 years old, and after selling his business in the US, he moved with land to Trisha and his daughter Christina from the land he was born to a beautiful cottage in the Lake Foreshode, Belgium.

934
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:22,160
And he also owned a piateir on the ingracht in the center of Amsterdam using a helicopter transportation to St. Tarts with these two places.

935
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:31,160
At the right years of being over there, and started to host a radio show on Das National Radio for Friday, 90, and 50.

936
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:39,160
At the Friday night, Funkathon with Curry and Kid V and a welcome many artists in the studio to perform live on here.

937
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:46,160
He carried out several old installation assignments and his family briefly started in the reality soap and his family.

938
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:57,160
Well, there's a lot to say about this soap. It was fun to watch every week about half an hour. I really enjoyed it until the moment I was having a pizza.

939
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:04,160
You know, with a pizza box on my lap in front of the TV, that's my first bite of the pizza I've ordered.

940
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:14,160
And there he was, a big willy and full erected penis coming through a TV screen, my living room watching me and my pizza.

941
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:22,160
I'm sorry, that was not the apple I wanted to see. I mean, it's not like I was jealous of something.

942
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:32,160
Till these days, I truly believe you didn't delete this scene on purpose. So thank you, Adam, because every time when I'm just always trying to eat pizza,

943
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,160
I get a kind of weird feeling in my stomach.

944
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,160
Soundtrack to my liking, my liking.

945
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:45,160
So 2002 was a year in which Adam got followed by several cameras for two years.

946
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:55,160
Twenty-four hours a day. The Adam's family aired only in Holland in 2002 and 2003 with a leader June from 1967.

947
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:59,160
Howard Kale and his five friends from the Turtles.

948
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:04,160
This song, Happy Together, was released in the spring of 67.

949
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:10,160
The song, Not The Beatles, Penny Lane, out of the number one slot for three weeks on the Billboard Hot 100s,

950
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,160
is was the group's only chart offer.

951
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:19,160
Anchories, the soundtrack to my life, takes a trip down and relayed to 2002.

952
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:25,160
Imagine me new, I do, I think about you day and night.

953
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:35,160
It's only right to think about the girl you love and hold a tight, so happy together.

954
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:41,160
I should call you up, invest a dime, and you say you belong to me.

955
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,160
It's my mind, imagine how the world is.

956
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:51,160
So we're fine, so happy together.

957
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:59,160
I can't see you, I know I didn't lie to you, but I'm not alive.

958
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:07,160
When you love me, I can't see you, but I'm not alive.

959
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:16,160
You and me, no matter how they toss the dice, to be the only one for me.

960
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:22,160
And you and me, so happy together.

961
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:31,160
I can't see you, I know I didn't lie to you, but I'm alive.

962
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:39,160
When you love me, I can't see you, but I'm alive.

963
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:48,160
You and me, no matter how they toss the dice, to be the only one for me.

964
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:55,160
And you and me, so happy together.

965
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:11,160
And you and me, no matter how they toss the dice, to be the only one for me.

966
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:17,160
And you and me, so happy together.

967
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:30,160
And you and me, so happy together.

968
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,160
So happy together.

969
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,160
So happy together.

970
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,160
So happy together.

971
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,160
So happy together.

972
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,160
So happy together.

973
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,160
So happy together.

974
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,160
So happy together.

975
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,160
So happy together.

976
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,160
So happy together.

977
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,160
So happy together.

978
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,160
So happy together.

979
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,160
So happy together.

980
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,160
So happy together.

981
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,160
So happy together.

982
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,160
So happy together.

983
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,160
So happy together.

984
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,160
So happy together.

985
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,160
What do we do for you?

986
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,160
Going right from tonight.

987
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,160
Thank you.

988
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,160
All right.

989
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,160
Let me just add a little bit of explanation there.

990
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,760
a guy named Greg Johnston, who used to be an associate producer on the headbangers ball and

991
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:32,240
I was like this is so brilliant. And at the time, it was not as contrived as they became.

992
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,480
And I said, this is fantastic. You know, and we were very much in the public eye in the

993
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,080
Netherlands, having, you know, returned and been back for a couple of years. And we had this

994
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:46,320
great pad and we had all this cool toys. I'm like, why don't we put together a show? But do

995
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:54,480
it all on Final Cut Pro, Final Cut on, yeah, Final Cut Pro. And we'll do it with Firewire hard drives.

996
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,440
And we'll just have a really small crew. We'll have our friends and had two friends, one editor,

997
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,560
and one camera man. And I'll do secondary camera. And we'll just wireless mics. We'll see we can

998
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:12,000
make a show out of it. And I sold it for, you know, a good price to SBS broadcasting. And so we had to

999
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:22,720
make this show. And it was fantastic. And even, and it was very much the way, it was, it was done in

1000
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,600
sequence. The production was kind of like the Davis source code in a way I would have to say.

1001
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:33,200
You know, some, some things with a little extra production boost. So we real, real heavy on playing,

1002
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,600
you know, putting hits in there and cool tunes that you remember. And indeed, the opening music

1003
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:42,240
was the turtles happy together. Because, and that's just the song that Patricia and I both love.

1004
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:48,560
It's one of those songs, you know. And, and I've got it on DVD. You know, Patricia keeps saying,

1005
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,960
you know, you should release that. You should do something with this. And first of all,

1006
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:56,000
you can't clear it. There's no way you can get a DVD release because it's filled with,

1007
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,600
I don't know, a 70 or 80 tracks. You know, you have to get clearances from every single one of them.

1008
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:06,000
That worked on television because it's different rules, different rules apply. And of course,

1009
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,280
you know, the ASCAD BMI was paid through the station. But I don't think you can sell it on a DVD.

1010
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,960
And, you know, it's kind of cool to have something, a document of a certain period of our life.

1011
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:25,600
And it was also a technological test. And it was a lot of fun. Now, about that one particular scene.

1012
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,760
Okay. So first of all, it wasn't fully erect. You know, I hate to hate to pop your bubble there,

1013
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:37,200
my friend. Second of all, it was only a few frames. No one saw it. In fact, it wasn't until the

1014
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:44,400
edit that caught your editors that, hey, you do. You got like the log poking out there.

1015
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:50,320
And I showed it to Patricia with letting out the shot, obviously. And she said, you know,

1016
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:55,120
you know, you know, it's so many shots where I'm staying there and my bare ass, or I got my boobs hanging out.

1017
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,640
So, you know, you should leave that in, damn it. And I think that's kind of fair. I said,

1018
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,800
you know, it was only a couple of frames. So I don't think anyone would see it. But then,

1019
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:08,640
young builder, a guy on a late night talk show, he had seen it, or someone had pointed it out to him.

1020
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,360
And then he put it up full screen, freeze frame, and then started, he went to work on it with a

1021
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:19,040
telestrator. Which is one of those, you know, they use it for sports like for football games.

1022
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:24,560
They can draw on the screen and show where the movement is. And then, of course, it kind of became

1023
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,560
lower. You can probably still Google that and there's a freeze frame of it online. There's no video of it.

1024
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:34,000
Because, you know, as I said, it's like three frames. So that's why we didn't edit it out, Ray.

1025
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,840
And was it cool to be back on the radio? Yeah, I mean, communicating with the, with the community.

1026
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,600
That's my hobby, man. I love doing it. And with the source code, I'm able to do that, you know,

1027
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:51,120
as a part of my job, which is, are you kidding me? I, I love it. Doing it live on the radio is

1028
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:55,600
different experience, but very important to me as well. Because, you know, it's my roots. I love,

1029
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:01,280
I love the live vibe, the direct interaction, which is why from time to time, I'll, I should try that again.

1030
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,240
I should crank up the live DSC. You know, even better, I need to get Patricia on the show.

1031
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,920
There's been a lot of change in the Charlie. There's been change in me personally.

1032
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:15,120
And we should confront her about it. But she knows. I'm sure she'll have something to say about it.

1033
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,080
And it may not all be good. So why don't I get her on the show?

1034
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,160
That's what I'll do for this week. Because she's home. I'm home. I'll be cool.

1035
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,160
Another thing I've just started to look into, thanks to John C. Devorek, is Oregon,

1036
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:38,400
which was, I think is Oregon, Oregon, Oregon, which is a, uh, yet another description for the

1037
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:44,640
energy force around, uh, which surrounds everything in the world. And this, uh, invented or discovered,

1038
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:52,880
or coined by this guy, Wilhelm Reich. And it's all part of the energy awakening that's taking place, um, as well.

1039
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:59,680
And of course, we got, uh, some calls about that from some familiar voices. Adam,

1040
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:08,400
Atomic Rod here, enjoying your awakening to the idea that the energy elites

1041
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:17,120
have a desire to keep their elite status and to keep out the riff riff. I'm not a big fan of

1042
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:23,840
zero point energy, but I've know a lot about almost zero point energy. Remember, I used to go around

1043
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:30,720
the world and a submarine whose fuel volume was small with the fit underneath my office desk

1044
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:38,080
it lasted for 15 years. Just imagine having fuel with that kind of density in an automobile,

1045
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:45,440
why you might get about 700 million miles per gallon. Yeah, I'm down with that atomic Rod.

1046
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,720
I know I've done the calculations. That's seven hundred million. I'm not some kind of guy who has

1047
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:57,040
done this at a swap meets and, uh, behind the scenes. I've actually operated those nuclear

1048
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:02,880
reactors with, hey man, what you got against swap meets tiny fuel sources. Just think about how

1049
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:08,880
threatening they are to the energy elite. Yeah. Just imagine the profitability of the deception

1050
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:15,440
campaigns that have been run to keep people afraid, fear uncertainty and out slows down the nuclear

1051
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:21,200
competition and makes it more expensive. The energy elites work for themselves. Bye now.

1052
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:27,040
Bye, Rod. Thank you. Patricia just snuck up behind me and came around from the right hand side

1053
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:32,400
in which it means I didn't, you know, usually I'll see you're called the steps and, uh, nice little

1054
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:40,800
snack here. Huh, what are these shrimp? Butterfly shrimp. Crisp, crispy, butterfly shrimp.

1055
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:48,240
It doesn't get much better than that. Yeah, man. Of course, there's so many different

1056
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:55,360
forms of energy that are so poorly researched. And, uh, and, you know, I'm awake, man. I'm awake

1057
01:00:55,360 --> 01:01:02,400
to the atomic energy. And I think there's more. I really do. There's more coming. There's more and

1058
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:08,400
more happening. But, you know, maybe we have to see, and maybe it's all coming to a head all the

1059
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:13,280
right moment. You know, maybe the meltdown will actually wipe out the energy elite for a while.

1060
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,680
Then maybe we can, we have a shot. You know, when the lights go off, people are going to come out

1061
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,280
of the woodwork with shit to make the lights go on. And that's what people are going to

1062
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:26,320
gravitate towards. So we may have to get to that point. And we may be moving there pretty damn

1063
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:32,960
quickly. One of the, the big government initiatives, and I'm sure some of it has must have to do

1064
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:38,560
with power. I mean, they're using magnets and protons and neutrons and all kinds of stuff that

1065
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:44,960
I really don't understand is this collider project in Geneva, the large headron collider. And I've

1066
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:50,240
asked for, you know, if you chuckle heads to check in and try and explain it to me. And here's one.

1067
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:55,280
The collider is the basic two of particle physics. It takes a stream of particles and accelerates them

1068
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,800
to really high kinetic energy levels before slamming them into a target. Both experiments create

1069
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:06,240
new particles predicted by theories or to examine their behavior. In order to research and discover

1070
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:13,280
more of these particles, larger colliders are needed. The U-lars, headron collider is a 10 billion

1071
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:18,400
dollar underground ring shaped tunnel. There's 27 kilometers and street conference with two

1072
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:24,320
beam traveling and opposite directions. It seems particles with 7 trillion electron volts of energy,

1073
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:33,200
probably at 99.9999% the speed of light. Now, this by the way is Russell,

1074
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:44,000
Biden, Russell, I'm still not getting it. And held in place by powerful magnets. It is the

1075
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,880
largest collider built to date, but a smaller compared to the discontinued superconducting

1076
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:54,640
super collider, 87 kilometers in street conference, or the even larger proposed very large

1077
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:02,080
headron collider at 105 to 650 kilometers in street conference. Considering that the universe already

1078
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:07,440
does 10 trillion lifetime runs of the headron collider every second such its inception,

1079
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:13,120
and our planet has yet to be destroyed. I doubt that anything that we humans do with our collider

1080
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:19,520
will have any negligible negative effect on our planet. And if anything, we'll expand our knowledge

1081
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:26,480
of the universe and how it was created. Alright, Russell. Okay, I'm down with that. I just find

1082
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:31,440
it suspicious that there's not a single politician who clearly okay, the payment for this thing,

1083
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,080
10 billion. We're going to actually explain what it's for. You know, we're looking for the

1084
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:42,000
god molecule. We're looking to find alternative energy. I mean, what's the direct benefit going to be

1085
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,440
if we actually find out that there was a big bang, and that's how the earth was created?

1086
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:52,880
What's the direct benefit at this moment in time? How much is that change? The energy

1087
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,200
elite are still going to run the show? Is that going to change anything there as far as I know?

1088
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:02,960
Or is this their project? That's what I'd like to know. And this one, it's another one of those

1089
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:09,040
new stories that actually, I almost, I almost considered not even giving it a second thought,

1090
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:13,280
and then I thought, wait a minute, that's really stupid. I should talk about this, and this should

1091
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:20,480
be on the show because I didn't hear about it anywhere from anyone. Adam here's the girl

1092
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:28,240
in here. In the unreported news category, oh my god, until I seventh last month or a month ago now,

1093
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:36,720
Obama's plane had to have a emergency landing. They were calling out crash and fire rescue to the

1094
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:43,280
landing strip in St. Louis, and I didn't even know about this until today on emergency landing

1095
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:48,400
ramp apparently deployed in the nose cone or the tail cone of the aircraft. Does this ever happen?

1096
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:55,520
You're a pilot. Does this happen often? Do you call for crash and fire rescue if it's not serious?

1097
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:02,400
Do you declare emergency landing if it's not very, very serious? Is this an attempt on a

1098
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:09,200
bomb of life? Was this an assassination death that we missed? Was this an intimidation? Was this

1099
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:14,080
pre-caximet? I don't know. But I ain't letting nothing come by me on dream land.

1100
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:22,880
Yeah. Yeah, so I saw this. And I thought nothing of it initially. I was saying, oh, you know,

1101
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:31,440
yeah, it didn't seem too serious. And then I started seeing news reports. Let's see, I think it was ABC News.

1102
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:38,320
Yeah, ABC News, they actually broke this story. Let me see if I can bring this up for you.

1103
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:44,320
Yeah, the bandwidth still sucks.

1104
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:50,080
Right, here it is. The incident involving Senator Barack Obama's campaign plane last month

1105
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:55,840
was much more serious than the airline or the federal aviation administration said, according to

1106
01:05:55,840 --> 01:06:03,360
FAA control tower tapes obtained by ABC News. At the time, the pilot did not declare an emergency

1107
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:10,160
and the airline owner Midwest Airlines said safety was never an issue. And then they broadcast the

1108
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:18,320
tapes. So, did you hear this? Yeah, it's see if I can fire this up from, of course, YouTube has it.

1109
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,920
Let's see if you can hear this. It's pretty interesting.

1110
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,000
It's ABC News, everybody. It's Charles Gibson.

1111
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:33,200
In the mid-X-80-653 changes, that's the same. It looks the other mechanical problems.

1112
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:37,760
And it's sending to one-one doubt. It's just to keep you advised. We have a control ability

1113
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:43,520
if you would to the aircraft. We have limited-fetched authority at the flight levels. We're

1114
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:48,160
just sending to see if we could re-keep it to authority. And we're going to have to stop

1115
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,320
probably around 8 to 10 steps. If you can figure the aircraft to make sure that we have

1116
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:58,640
to start. So, what I'm hearing here is they're at a flight level, probably like 35,000 feet.

1117
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:05,840
And I think it's a 757. And so control pitch issues means they can't,

1118
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:15,440
well, wait a minute. He says he can go down. So, I guess he would the only way to do that if he can't

1119
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:26,480
control the upper-down pitch is by reducing power. That'll do it. That's a pretty scary position

1120
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:34,320
to be in. If you can't push the nose forward and have it go down or pull the yolk back and

1121
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:43,280
have the nose rise. So, it sounds like they were going to be trying different ways to move that

1122
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,280
on their way down and they must have been reducing power to do it. That's what it sounds like to me.

1123
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:59,680
Hello. Hello. That's the Clarenone Emergency. That is an emergency. And you're only declaring

1124
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:04,880
that the guy wants to land. That's what he wants to do. That's why you declare an emergency.

1125
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:11,600
It doesn't mean you're on fire, but it's like you need priority. But if it's emergency status,

1126
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:17,840
that's the FAA didn't, it was not truthful. It's an emergency status. It doesn't mean necessarily

1127
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:25,280
that there's something really, definitely wrong. It's like need to land, need priority. Now,

1128
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:29,280
and that's how the controller will respond. I'll say that it's easy for a standing fire,

1129
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:35,680
see you, let's medicate you 653. I will show that. And would you be able to put it on runways?

1130
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:39,280
Would you like runway 3, or right or runway 3, or left? Well, which one is the longest?

1131
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:46,320
I'll medicate you 653 runway 3, or left. Okay. Sorry. I'm eating one of those butterfly shrimp.

1132
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:51,280
So there you go. Immediately comes back. Well, runway do you want? Which means, you know, he's

1133
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:56,320
going in St. Louis and he asks for the crash and fire rescue, because he's thinking he can't control

1134
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:01,840
the nose. He's going to have to do that with a combination of perhaps flaps if he can control those

1135
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:06,800
and power. And that's why I said, give me the longest runway possible, although in any emergency

1136
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:13,440
situation, you want the broadest, longest piece of landing strip available. That'll just make

1137
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:19,920
you feel good. Okay. We'd like 3-0 left. It's just for informational purposes. We have Senator

1138
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:27,680
Obama on board, the aircraft, the Biscuit F8. Medic 8663. Roger that. Medic 8663. And can you give

1139
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:35,600
me the souls on board and the fuel that you have remaining in counts. 51 souls on board. You

1140
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:42,240
want that out to what he wants out. Medic 8663. Roger that. And that's 51 and 2, including

1141
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:47,920
all the pastures you include. That's affirmative. Medic 8663. In addition to confirm the problem

1142
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:53,920
with your emergency is it's a equipment problem, an understanding that the ability to

1143
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,840
control it. That was up on higher altitudes, so you're going to have that problem all the way down.

1144
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:04,160
So we had a pitch authority problem. Now that we've come down to a lower altitudes, it's team

1145
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:11,120
to rectify itself. We do have pitch control of the aircraft at this time. Medic 8663. So

1146
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:19,280
do you need any special handling other than the CFR or Sting Blackboard? So, now for what I understand

1147
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:27,840
they went down to like 8,000 feet. And that the problem was indeed like either an emergency

1148
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:36,000
raft or emergency slide that deployed inside the tail cone. And that was, I think the equivalent

1149
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,640
of what the story is is that was rubbing up against the wires because of all of this is control

1150
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:46,640
controlled from the front, you know, the controls eventually come to the back. It is a high tail.

1151
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:57,760
So the pitch will be controlled from that. So it's possible. And I'm just and I see I'm sure

1152
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:02,400
we need to get like cat and Chris or someone else who who's flown these these aircraft and

1153
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:07,200
can understand it. I mean, it sounds feasible that maybe that thing deployed. And of course the

1154
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:13,520
tail cone, there's a lot of the function of the tail cone is for pressurization. So they got down

1155
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:19,600
to 8,000 feet. They were able to depressurize and maybe that helped loosen up whatever was rubbing

1156
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:24,960
against whatever control wires. But it doesn't sound like a really credible story quite honestly.

1157
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:30,880
And if it wasn't a assassination attempt, then it was definitely CIA because that they loved

1158
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,280
killing people on airplanes. That's what they loved doing. And then it wasn't the Clintons doing

1159
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:39,120
anything because they'd just like to shoot people. And at least that's what I've been seeing

1160
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:44,800
in all these documentaries. It's crazy. Absolutely nuts. And it's going to be interesting to see

1161
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:52,960
what happens with the Democratic National Convention, where they're going to do a state-by-state

1162
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:58,560
vote. And, you know, if I were a super delegate, I'd be thinking, hey man, that guy in Arkansas

1163
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,880
got whacked. You know, I'm a, but maybe that was a message. I might want to be kind of careful.

1164
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:08,080
Now we've got lady to Rothchild. There's a name for you. One of the true owners of the globe.

1165
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:15,520
We're enslaved to them. Slowly breaking free mind you. She's in support of Hillary. And actually,

1166
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:22,800
you know, if you go together for us.com, you'll see. She's what she's exactly what she wanted.

1167
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:28,400
She got and we want a roll call vote. And we want the 18 million people who voted for Hillary to be

1168
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:36,080
happy. And essentially get her in office. Would it be wacky if, if she won and then she turned around

1169
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:41,600
and she said to Obama be my VP? Wouldn't that be crazy? Wouldn't that not work, but wouldn't it be nuts?

1170
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:49,920
Ha. All right. I'm running out of steam. Let me play one more song which comes with

1171
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:57,120
its own intro. Thank God. I got him. This was Justin. I just dropped a file and the drop I

1172
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:03,040
owe called Peruvian cocaine. And unfortunately, I couldn't get it to take the metadata. This

1173
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:10,560
is a mortal technique revolutionary volume to track called Peruvian cocaine. All right,

1174
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:15,760
man. I've heard whispers about the financial support your government receives from a drug industry.

1175
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,160
Well, the irony of this, of course, is that this money, which is in the billions,

1176
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:26,480
is coming from your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of our national product,

1177
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:31,360
which is, of course, cocaine. Okay. On one hand, you're saying the United States government is spending

1178
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:37,120
millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the same time,

1179
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:42,960
we're doing business with a very same government that is flooding our streets with cocaine.

1180
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:47,680
Let me show you a few of the other characters that are involved in this tragic comedy.

1181
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,120
Like a slave, the poker fields have to be pretty, distributed. My people is starving,

1182
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:22,480
broken and sweaty, dreaming about revolution, looking at my machete, but the work load is too heavy,

1183
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:27,360
derisa been ons, and ever ran away. I know they probably murder my mom, so I pray that has

1184
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:32,000
some good Easter when I go to the mission, process the cocaine paste and play my position.

1185
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:48,000
This war is so hot. Feet your kids. I need these bricks. For the tons of total, let me test it.

1186
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:54,080
Yeah, this is good. Pass me your tissue and don't worry about them. I paid off the affair.

1187
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:58,560
Yo, it's all come as a challenge. I'm the son of some of the fellas, the legend by my people.

1188
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:03,680
The only one in the family born in bread to console with beds. I laughed at fate and assassinate.

1189
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:07,280
My predecessor had his place in a thorough world fashion state.

1190
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:11,680
Locked a nation with 90% of the wealthy 10% of the population, essentially,

1191
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:16,960
intelligent, agency takes away faithfully. The finest type for China, white and cocaine, you see.

1192
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:22,160
Honey, I'm home. Never mind when you think it can't suddenly grown. It's funny with so under this debt for this money,

1193
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:27,120
we owe a job. Whenever told you that I had to give a mental, but grown to keep us underholding a private school,

1194
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:31,360
but to keep us home, he's swollen. Come on, I fucking home was built in a foundation of bloody roads.

1195
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:35,120
The hungry stole the nothing so across this country's running cold. I took a stunning oath,

1196
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,480
the hush, the ones who know that see I acreed up to the flow for this young hush,

1197
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:39,480
you know,

1198
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,640
And

1199
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:55,440
He

1200
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,500
he

1201
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,200
This is my true promise, stop it and back in

1202
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,000
Take your pictures and tap and phone

1203
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
The bacon snitches and crack and cold

1204
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Fast the couple blast the phone

1205
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,500
And he hush the stack and soul

1206
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,500
Let's pull the crack up low

1207
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:12,000
And my overtime is where your taxes go

1208
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
A game you trust

1209
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,500
Get you the hand way to us

1210
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,500
Cause we paid up front on the lower cameras

1211
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:19,000
Taping up, getting proper weight

1212
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,500
The prison said this is doing

1213
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,500
Make the collar that leaves with two keys

1214
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,500
Out the evidence

1215
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,500
We're wet my frame

1216
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,500
Trunk both the plane and watch it

1217
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,000
You're hungry, you got work

1218
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
They're clapping too

1219
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,500
We can throw black

1220
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,500
They lack countries and own companies

1221
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,500
We had nice cars and sneaker money

1222
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,000
Now it's payin' us out here

1223
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,500
Talk about they hold it

1224
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,500
So busting it house

1225
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,500
Like they down south

1226
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,500
When those open, let the way long

1227
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,000
Roll, you take shots and swoops

1228
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,500
That's it be a billion mouth

1229
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,000
Like fucks and swoops

1230
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
So when you're the rush

1231
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,500
The pressure, co-brands

1232
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,000
When you're being in south with me

1233
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,500
Like ch any low pass

1234
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,000
And this cool, I was a bully

1235
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Now life is fully in joke

1236
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,500
I keep a flow on the ball

1237
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,000
For moving in cool

1238
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Plays do favors for governors

1239
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And tax makers

1240
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Fat quick and slow

1241
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Crack and sex act

1242
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
What fat man is

1243
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
So what's got edge

1244
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Big mouth's probably snow

1245
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Not prepared to do this

1246
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Like high-ve-are

1247
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
The story just cold

1248
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
It's an example

1249
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
It's half the truck's tape

1250
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I narrated every neighborhood

1251
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
And every state

1252
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
And it's country

1253
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
It's a lot deeper

1254
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Than it niggas on your blind

1255
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
So when they point the finger

1256
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
This is what you got to tell them

1257
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I'm not guilty

1258
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
You're the one who's guilty

1259
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Low makers, the politicians

1260
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
The Colombian drug lord

1261
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
All you who lobby against making drugs legal

1262
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Just like you did with alcohol doing the prohibition

1263
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
You're the one who's guilty

1264
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I mean, come on, let's kick the ballistic here

1265
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Ain't no dosies made in Harlem

1266
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Not one of us in here

1267
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
All's a poppy feet

1268
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
This thing is bigger than immortal technique

1269
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
This is big business

1270
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
This is the American way

1271
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
There you go, immortal technique

1272
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
All right, there it is

1273
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
There's the word that's how it works

1274
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
You know, you can go read legacy

1275
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
The ashes and

1276
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Go all the way through a

1277
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Was it 700 page book and come to the same conclusion

1278
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Well, you're listening to a four and a half minute song

1279
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
And I who you're going to believe

1280
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I'll believe these guys before I believe CNN

1281
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
All right

1282
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Okay, so there you go

1283
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
It's a big scam and

1284
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
And all of us, all the people

1285
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
We're just, you know, a part of their machinery

1286
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And we're starting to wake up to it

1287
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
And there's people inside the machinery

1288
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Inside governments inside all kinds of institutions

1289
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Who are also wide awake

1290
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
They're listening to the show right now

1291
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
They're visiting websites, they're figuring it out

1292
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
They, in fact, they know a head of a lot more

1293
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And we welcome our brothers and sisters on the inside

1294
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
And we want to help

1295
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And if you are working there

Should be working for us now is the time

1298
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
You know, now is the time to do something

1299
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
We can do it together, I'm sure of that

1300
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
So my mission

1301
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
