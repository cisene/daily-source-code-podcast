00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,920
It's Friday, October 31st, 2008, the new world owner has shown its ugly face.

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,280
Bringing down the global financial system and a heap of disgrace, all the chuckleheads

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:34,840
know what to do. As we roll out Delta Shira Charney 802, warning, these stories aren't just

4
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:42,040
any Halloween tales, I tell you, these my predictions are the reality of the world, they are

5
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:48,520
all true, being afraid my predictions, being a veteran afraid.

6
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:38,040
It's close to me and I, something people are working from the door, I'm not the

7
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:54,120
moon. You try to scream, but terror take this song before you make it, and you start to breathe,

8
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:02,200
as I will look you like a dream in the eyes, you're very nice, I can set it down.

9
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Delta, I know, it's no one's gonna sing, and probably it's a lot's fine, but you know, it's down.

10
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:26,280
Delta, I know, it's no one's gonna sing, but terror take this song before you make it, and you start to breathe,

11
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:42,360
you're very nice, I know, it's no one's gonna sing, but terror take this song before you make it,

12
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:52,120
and hope that there's just a mission nation, there's a lot of world, there's a dream that

13
00:02:52,120 --> 00:03:22,120
feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels

14
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:35,300
a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream and feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream that feels like a dream.

15
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,120
I'm going to do it now, I'm going to roll you get the

16
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Yeah, I'll do the night

17
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,120
I'll take it from the chair on the screen

18
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,120
I'll make a scene, I'm not gonna do it

19
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Then I'm going to go back and change the moment

20
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,120
Then I'll go back and change the moment

21
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,120
Then I'm going to do it

22
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,120
Then I'll go back and change the moment

23
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,120
Then I'll do it now

24
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:41,120
Then I'll go back and change my Kamera

25
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Then I'll go back and change the moment

26
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,120
I've got a way to run

27
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,120
Darkness falls across the land

28
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,120
The midnight hour is close at hand

29
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,120
Creatures crawling the certain land

30
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,120
I've terrorized your inevitable

31
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,120
I don't remember shall we hold

32
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Without the souls all getting down

33
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,120
A stand in the face of the homes of hell

34
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,120
And rock inside a corpse and shell

35
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,120
I've got a way to run

36
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,120
I'm having, we might as well be brutally honest about it

37
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,120
There is no better record for a Halloween footballer friend

38
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,120
What do you say?

39
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,120
I've got a way to run

40
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,120
It takes all my marks and all the messages in the air

41
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,120
The funk of 40,000 years

42
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,120
And currently the goals were never too long

43
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,120
I've got a way to see you live

44
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,120
And though you've found out to stay alive

45
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,120
You're far in your start to achieve

46
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
Or no more cold

47
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,120
For the law

48
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,120
I absolutely love it

49
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,120
I absolutely love it

50
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Vince and Christ Michael Jackson

51
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,120
And thriller Perfect for a footballer Friday

52
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Of course, the Halloween addition

53
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Which means we've got to keep the maximum

54
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
Music freight train express roll

55
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,760
And cruisin' the drop, playin' some tunes.

56
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,640
It's football in joy.

57
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,720
Why is marijuana not legal?

58
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,840
Why is marijuana not legal?

59
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,800
It's a natural plant that grows in the dirt.

60
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,280
You know, it's not natural, 80-year-old dudes with hard-ons.

61
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,320
That's not natural, but we got pills for that.

62
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,120
We're dedicating all our medical resources

63
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,760
to keeping the old guys erect,

64
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,360
but we're putting people in jail for smoking

65
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,840
something that grows in the dirt.

66
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,520
You know, we have more prescription drugs now

67
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,080
that every commercial entity is a prescription drug addict.

68
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,280
We can't watch TV for four minutes.

69
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,080
We have five series diseases.

70
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Like, you ever wake up tired in the morning?

71
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,080
I've got to have this right this down whenever it is I have it.

72
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,080
That's the time you don't even know what the commercial is.

73
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,080
There's people running through fields or flying kites.

74
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
There's swimming in the ocean like that.

75
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
It's the greatest disease ever.

76
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
How do you get that?

77
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
That disease comes with a hot chick and a puppy.

78
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
The schools, now it's all about self-esteem and the school.

79
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
The kids self-esteem.

80
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Make them feel good about themselves.

81
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
If everybody grows up with high self-esteem,

82
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
who's gonna dance in our strip clubs?

83
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
What's gonna happen?

84
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,080
The point out with these women don't just grow on trees.

85
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,080
It takes lots and grunked out.

86
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,080
He's missing a lot of dance recital before you decide to blow a goat on the internet for 50 bucks.

87
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,080
And if that disappears, when does that leave me on a Friday with a new high-speed connection?

88
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,080
The baby is a baby.

89
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
The baby is a baby.

90
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
The baby is a baby.

91
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
The baby is a baby.

92
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
The baby is a baby.

93
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
The baby is a baby.

94
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
The baby is a baby.

95
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
The baby is a baby.

96
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
The baby is a baby.

97
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
The baby is a baby.

98
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
The baby is a baby.

99
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
We're going to try and kick it through.

100
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
The baby is also a baby.

101
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
The baby's doing well after a week.

102
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
The baby.

103
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,080
The baby.

104
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
Torries.

105
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
To find other men.

106
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
What to call our baby.

107
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
You should go.

108
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
I'll get some sleep.

109
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
You are there.

110
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Do you?

111
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,080
If you're going to use stairs ride.

112
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
The baby's hiding behind.

113
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Normally, with many kids leaves,

114
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
a morning, and the baby's keeping him with each other.

115
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
They're real you

116
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,400
Americans this face that we've been a spoiled country for a long time. I mean, what the number one health risk in America is obesity

117
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,260
obesity

118
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,560
They say we're the middle of an obesity epidemic and epidemic like it's polio

119
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,720
And we'll be telling our grandkids about it one day the great obesity epidemic of 2004 had to get through a grandpot

120
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,400
Oh, it was horrible Charlie there was cheese cake and pork chops everywhere

121
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,460
Nobody knows why we're getting fat or look at our lifestyle. I'll sit in a drive to us at different

122
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,100
I'll sit there behind 15 other cars instead of getting up and making an eight foot walk in the totally empty counter

123
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,300
Everything's mega meal super fries won't piggy fries with that one a jumbo fry one a collage one a big fry one a 30-footers for a neckley

124
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,940
If I'm on the blue there's room in the bag and take it

125
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,660
What a 55 gallon drum with coke with that. It's only three more cents

126
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,340
You

127
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,100
Sometimes you got to suffer a little in your youth to motivate you to see later in life

128
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,220
You think of Bill Gates got laid in high school. Do you think there be a Microsoft?

129
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,340
Of course not you got to spend a lot of time stuff in your locker with you underwear wedge top your ass before you start thinking

130
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,780
We're in one of the richest countries in the world in the minimum wage

131
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,100
So it's lower now than it was 35 years ago

132
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,140
There are homeless people everywhere that this homeless guy asked me for money together day as about to give it to him

133
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,900
And I thought you just can use it on drugs or alcohol and then I thought that's what I'm gonna use it on

134
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,140
Why am I judging this poor bastard people loves each other homeless guys like you get the money

135
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,860
She's gonna waste it. He's gonna waste the money. Well, he lives in a box

136
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,700
What do you want to do with this thing that I'm by all alone? You're gonna take a little run the store for a throw

137
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,620
We're gonna see the rackies homeless. I walk the honest guy the other day a homeless guy

138
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,180
Answered for money. You'll try that the homeless guy is much better. I'm gonna job your film

139
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,300
People always say that the homeless guys get a job like it's always that easy this homeless guy

140
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,540
We've heard his underwear outside his pants. I'm guessing he's resonating all up to date

141
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,340
I'm predicting some problem during the interview process

142
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,780
I'm pretty sure even McDonald's as an underwear go inside the pants policy

143
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,300
Not that they enforce it very strictly, but technically I'm sure it's on the books

144
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:56,860
Yeah, it's been around for a couple of years for the perfect song to play on a Friday

145
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,860
Lazy boy

146
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,860
underwear goes inside the pants

147
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,940
Oh

148
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,580
We got some good stuff coming up for you today. Yeah, as I said just kind of cruising through the drop got a couple of

149
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,780
Awesome pieces of a video to share with you later on

150
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,300
Of course, you'll only hear the audio. I'll be enjoying the video. You can check that out later in the show knows

151
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,220
You don't want to find those daily source go dot com crosspost at a curry dot com

152
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,740
Coming to you friends again from the curry man in

153
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:33,740
One of the west side of G town the affluent suburb of Surrey known as gilford. It is Halloween

154
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,420
I don't think you know although they do celebrate it here in the UK trick or treating is not really a big thing

155
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:47,340
And it's funny because Halloween has been kind of propagated throughout to western Europe mainly because of the movie

156
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,140
Halloween

157
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,940
And what's even funny here is that in some countries I'm looking at you Holland people call it

158
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,220
Halloween. I mean, they've really taken it a whole extra step further

159
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,140
So in honor of

160
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,460
Halloween

161
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,700
Let me

162
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,780
Give you a Halloween joke

163
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:17,740
Cabby picks up a nun. She gets into the cab and notices the very handsome cab driver just won't stop staring at her

164
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:24,220
She asks him a while he's staring he replies why have a question asked but I really don't want to offend you

165
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:30,700
She answers my son. You cannot offend me when you're as old as I am you've been a nun as long as I have

166
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,740
You get a chance to see and hear just about everything. I'm sure there's nothing you could say or ask that

167
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,620
I wouldn't find that I would find offensive in any manner whatsoever

168
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,380
Well, I've always had a fantasy to kiss a nun

169
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:48,540
She responds well, uh, let's see what we can do about that apparently she was a milking nun

170
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,060
Well, but of course you have to be single and you must be Catholic

171
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,700
The cab driver is very excited and says yeah, yeah, I'm single and I'm Catholic

172
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Okay, the nun says

173
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
The next alley

174
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,020
The nun fulfills his fantasy with a kiss that would make a hooker blush

175
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:12,460
And they've get back on the road the cab driver starts crying. Oh my dear child said the nun. Why are you crying?

176
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,740
Forgive me sister, I have sinned

177
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,740
I lied and I must confess

178
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,420
I married and I'm Jewish

179
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,460
The nun says it's okay. My name's Kevin. I'm going to a Halloween party

180
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,980
It can happen in Amsterdam in fact easily

181
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,260
Today, I'm whole confused

182
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,580
Yet I look for the light to the pouring rain

183
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,740
You know that again that I hate to lose

184
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,180
And I'm feeling the strain

185
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,780
And in a shame

186
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,540
In a dream I saw

187
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,540
You lost and you rocked it all and you didn't go away

188
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,580
Oh, you in a dream I saw

189
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,820
I want to get lost and you rocked it all and you didn't go away

190
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,980
Hey

191
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,260
Beginning to think that I'm wasting time

192
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,740
I don't understand the things I do

193
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,060
The world outside looks so unkind

194
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,380
And I'm coming over you

195
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,220
To carry me through

196
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,220
Oh, you in a dream I saw

197
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,060
You lost and you rocked it all and you didn't go away

198
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,700
Hell, you in a dream I saw

199
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,260
You lost and you rocked it all and you didn't go away

200
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:19,500
When my mind is free

201
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,060
You know melody can move me

202
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,620
When I'm feeling blue

203
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,260
It does come in through the foot me

204
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,940
Thanks for the joy that you give me

205
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,380
I want you to know I'm leaving you so home

206
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,260
With a miriam and harmony

207
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,380
You help me alone

208
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,820
Making this home

209
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,580
Give me the beat for us and free my soul

210
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,900
I want to get lost and you rock and roll and drift away

211
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,900
Give me the beat for us and free my soul

212
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,380
I want to get lost and you rock and roll and drift away

213
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,540
Give me the beat for us and free my soul

214
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,860
I want you to know I'm leaving you so home

215
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:39,740
Oh, you in a dream I saw

216
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:45,340
You lost and you rocked it all and you didn't go away

217
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,820
Now, now, now, now, now, now

218
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,460
Now, now, now, now, now, now

219
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,460
Now, now, now, now, now

220
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,460
Now, now, now, now

221
00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:07,180
I've been keeping notes every single time I hear a think of a song that's good for the

222
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,180
Chuck, I'm putting it into my Nokia

223
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,820
He knew a spreadsheet no less with the quick office

224
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,580
I've set up a quick key for it

225
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,180
Oh, yeah, it works so nice

226
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,380
Who? Another fabulous fade out

227
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,580
Sorry about that

228
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,140
I just wanted to hit one piece of feedback that had come in from

229
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,380
I know a long time listener, Doug Ritter

230
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,820
And Doug had a little bit of feedback on 801, which was yesterday's show

231
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,460
And two points, two main points really, first one about credit cards

232
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,620
And I think I pretty much stated that

233
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,140
You know, this, you're going to be hearing this mean paper to plastic

234
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,980
Moving from money to credit cards paper to plastic paper to plastic

235
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,260
You're going to be hearing that over and over again because they want to

236
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,140
You know, make digital money the next big thing

237
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,420
And based upon what only God knows, but just numbers in a spreadsheet

238
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,620
Highly, many people have been in a minute, many people have been in a bit of a bowl

239
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,900
And I said, you know, man, hey, there's lots of people using credit cards

240
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,220
Now, number one vendor is McDonald's

241
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,700
And I take that, I absolutely to be a cheap dinner

242
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,220
Bracket up on the credit card

243
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,220
I mean, maybe that is just the way I am

244
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,780
However, Doug says, just want to give you some feedback in a comment about credit cards and McDonald's

245
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,420
I laughed because just before listening to the show, I used to credit card for six dollars and one cent at

246
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,020
Chick-fil-A, that's a Southern U.S. fast food joint

247
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:36,940
I'm just about 30, but I noticed there's a generation who view people using credit cards with a certain amount of prejudice

248
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,300
And this indeed could be me Doug

249
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,820
I noticed that a lot with my dad as well, okay, that hurts

250
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,620
He's of a simpler mindset of you

251
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,420
I and a lot of your listeners about the current state of the world

252
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,380
And he will tell me stories about people using credit cards for this and that and when I pull a credit card out to use it for a meal

253
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,860
He always says, oh no, no, I can get it and whips out his cash assuming I don't have the money to pay for it

254
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,860
Even though he knows better

255
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:04,220
I guess my point is, as Doug, I own my own home paid off mortgage own both cars outright have no debt

256
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,140
These are not gonna cash in the bank. Yeah, you know what Doug, you're an exception my friend

257
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,540
I hope you're not, but I'm pretty sure an exception

258
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,380
I have been known to frequent McDonald's and I see what's going on

259
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,540
Second thing Doug says about the exon profits

260
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,860
Why is such a big deal made out of this?

261
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,220
And he goes on to say that you know the margin their profit margin is is quite

262
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,940
Quite thin compared to other companies

263
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,620
And it goes on to say it's a really easy to jump on the anti-big oil bandwagon

264
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:41,660
But not very logical. What do you think exon is a charity? No, but I wanted to say they're um Doug

265
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:48,380
That they're not a charity. They're more like a dealer and what's happening now is a large

266
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,340
Part of the dealer's customers

267
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,580
mainly those who use oil for driving and transportation

268
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,500
Use little stimulus in the market let the drug dealer provide this stimulus seems pretty fair to me

269
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,460
Like hey kid want a taste

270
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,180
Come on, I'll give it to you for free, you know

271
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,140
Come on, don't you want to be cool all the kids to do what it has some oil hey they snap it down

272
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,660
Get suspicious, but no oil in the middle of my head

273
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:43,820
And I know that it's true that all the things that I do will come out of me on my sleeping time

274
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,860
So keep on rockin' me made

275
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,460
Keep on or rockin' me made

276
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,140
Keep on or rockin' me made

277
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,060
Keep on or rockin' me made

278
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,900
keep on or rockin' me made

279
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,340
Keep on or rockin' me made

280
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,780
Keep on or rockin' me made

281
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,980
Keep on or rockin' me made

282
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,980
Keep on or rockin' me made

283
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,940
Keep on or rockin' me made

284
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,020
Keep on or rockin' me made

285
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,100
Keep on or rockin' me made

286
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,060
Keep on or rockin' me made

287
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,060
Don't walk in me, baby

288
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,060
Keep on walking me, baby

289
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,060
Baby, baby, baby, baby

290
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,060
Keep on walking, baby

291
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,060
Keep on walking, baby

292
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,060
Keep on walking, baby

293
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,060
Keep on walking me, baby

294
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,060
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

295
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,060
Don't get suspicious, no, no

296
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,060
Be suspicious, baby

297
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,060
No, you won't wear my mind

298
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,060
And you know that it's true

299
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,060
That all I'm thinking of, you won't

300
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,060
I'm going back to you in your sweet day

301
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,060
I'll wait for Phoenix

302
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,060
I don't want to go away

303
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,060
I just don't want to feel it

304
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,060
Help me, you will have a L.A.

305
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,060
No, then California weather curve

306
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,060
So I could have a living baby

307
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,060
Say, keep on walking me

308
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,060
No, I just need a minute

309
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,060
I got news for you, man

310
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,060
The girls in northern California

311
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,060
I can't even walk

312
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,060
Besides, it's like, warm

313
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,060
I know they're kind of cold

314
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,060
He's not by the bay

315
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,060
It's cold

316
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,060
I can't even walk

317
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,060
I can't even walk

318
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,060
Oh, I got to speak in a weather

319
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
I got to have a lot of some

320
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,060
Some of the weather coming up for you

321
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,060
You're gonna love that

322
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,060
I can't even be there

323
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,060
And just staying with the

324
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,060
With the proposed bailout of the auto industry

325
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,060
That Doug responded to John McCain

326
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,060
Is not come out and said

327
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,060
The struggling US auto industry

328
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,060
Could not be allowed to fail

329
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,060
And if elected president he would do quote

330
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,060
Whatever I think needs to be done

331
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,060
To save it and quote

332
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,060
25 billion dollars

333
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,060
What they're looking for

334
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,060
And some of this is earmarked

335
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,060
Some of this is earmarked

336
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,060
To be used for

337
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,060
New plug-in vehicles

338
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,060
Or actually I don't think he actually

339
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
stipulates plug-in vehicles

340
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,060
I think this 25 billion was discussed

341
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,060
Earlier has been on the table a long time

342
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,060
Before they started talking about a bailout

343
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,060
They were looking for low cost loans

344
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,060
But it was for alternative fuel vehicles

345
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,060
Now the plug-in hybrid that's Barack Obama's agenda

346
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,060
Hi, yes

347
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,060
Something that I had not seen yet

348
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,060
Which has apparently been around for

349
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,060
Well, it looks like almost a year

350
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,060
If not longer

351
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,060
An HBO special called Hacking Democracy

352
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
And of course you're going to see a lot of

353
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,060
Talk now about voting machines

354
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,060
And how they work

355
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,060
And I urge you to take a look at this

356
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,060
About an hour and a half

357
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,060
It's HBO its quality

358
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,060
Although it's very much a reality type documentary

359
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,060
Following these people who

360
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,060
Basically try to track down and see

361
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,060
If there is a possibility to commit

362
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,060
fraud with voting machines

363
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,060
And well, I'm not going to spoil it for you

364
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,060
Okay

365
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,060
I almost won't do that

366
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,060
But definitely have a look at that

367
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,060
And of course you can find both links

368
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,060
In the show notes of dailysourcecode.com

369
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,060

You and me, you and me, you but, you and me

418

You and me, you and me, you and I should get ahold of me

You and me, you and me, you and you

422

I should get ahold of me

You and me, you and me, you and me

424
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,060
Makes me mad, it's not the moment

425
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,060
I'm the star, I'm the star

426
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,060
I'm the star, I'm the star

427
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,060
Makes me mad, it's not the moment

428
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,060
I'm the star, I'm the star

429
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,060
I'm the star, I'm the star

430
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,060
Makes me mad, it's not the moment

431
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,060
I'm the star, I'm the star

432
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,060
I'm the star, I'm the star

433
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,060
Makes me mad, it's not the moment

434
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,060
I'm the star, I'm the star

435
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,060
Makes me mad, it's not the moment

436
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,060
I'm the star, I'm the star

437
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,060
Makes me mad, it's not the moment

438
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,060
I'm the star, I'm the star

439
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,060
The best moment, people are people

440
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,060
On daily source code episode eight zero two

441
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,060
Very, very dark here in the UK

442
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,060
That's mainly because we're all alone at home

443
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,060
and have not turned on the backyard lights

444
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,060
Usually there's a whole family doing stuff like that

445
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,060
No, it's just me, all alone

446
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,060
I've fed the animals though, next up it's my turn

447
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,060
First though, to continue, this is fantastic

448
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,060
I can't believe that I'm only hearing about this now

449
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:11,060
This apparently was posted to YouTube in March earlier this year

450
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,060
But it's only now coming to my attention

451
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,060
This is a YouTube video, it's an interview from...

452
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,060
I think it's a...

453
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:24,060
Yes, hold on a second, let me just turn that back

454
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,060
What is it, KUS?

455
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,060
I am trying to see what the...

456
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,060
It looks...

457
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Well, it definitely looks like a real news interview

458
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,060
Because you know, this monitors in the background

459
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,060
And something, you know, news desk logo

460
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,060
KUSI is, I think, is the call letters

461
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:48,060
And so this is Jim Coleman, Jim Coleman is the founder of the weather channel

462
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:52,060
And it's great to have a guy of his authority, he's a scientist

463
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:57,060
And he's been a long time meteorologist on television as well

464
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:01,060
And as I said, he founded the network, the weather channel

465
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:05,060
And he is finally someone of authority who is just sitting there

466
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,060
And almost in a disgusted manner

467
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:11,060
Talking about this bogus climate change

468
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,060
bogus bogus bogus

469
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:18,060
And the bogus IPCC, which is a division of the United Nations

470
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,060
Since, when is the last time you trusted that crooked bunch, huh?

471
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,060
There's always shenanigans going on there

472
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,060
I mean, just say that's...

473
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:31,060
Just Google News that, you'll find all kinds of shit going on with the United Nations

474
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,060
Huh, please

475
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,060
But he actually has the statistics, he has the figures

476
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,060
He knows how many scientists actually sign papers

477
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,060
Who doesn't agree, what the general consensus is

478
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,060
The guy is amazing and I love the way he talks

479
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,060
It's four parts, so what is that?

480
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,060
It's probably like a 30 minutes total, a little over 35 minutes

481
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,060
You know, YouTube's 10-minute restriction on the upload

482
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,060
I just can't get enough of this

483
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,060
I'm going to play you a couple minutes worth

484
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,060
And I know you're going to immediately after the show is over

485
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,060
In the minute you hit a computer, you're going to want to get the show link from

486
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,060
DailySourceCode.com, you'll love it

487
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,060
Are you real concerned about this global warming?

488
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:12,060
I'm only concerned about the incredible frenzy and hype

489
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,060
For something that's a total myth

490
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,060
That concerns me a lot

491
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:19,060
Because people are going hysterical about it

492
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,060
It's amazing to me

493
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,060
How upset so many people are

494
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,060
And how many billions of dollars

495
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,060
Apparently our governments are going to spend of our tax dollars

496
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,060
To combat something that isn't real

497
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,060
That has my attention

498
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,060
Believe me

499
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,060
As a scientist, I know the global warming

500
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,060
Doesn't really exist at all

501
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,060
In any sense of significance

502
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,060
And that we have nothing to worry about

503
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,060
At this guy, I love the ways

504
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,060
You guys are full of shit, that's basically what he says

505
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,060
Are you saying that there hasn't even been any warming?

506
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:02,060
Absolutely, natural climate fluctuations

507
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,060
We have little ice ages, we have warm-ups

508
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,060
Historically, the earth has vacilated through all of these

509
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,060
Solar cycles change dramatically

510
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,060
Urgent currents change

511
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,060
And all of that has a significant impact on climate

512
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:23,060
And the building of cities, the flying of airplanes

513
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,060
The existence of all these billions of people on earth

514
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,060
Have all influenced the climate of earth

515
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:34,060
But none of it is a significant and thank goodness

516
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,060
Things are doing just fine

517
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,060
Oh man, I love this

518
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,060
Of course, the reason why this is so important is because

519
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:45,060
Based upon this report from the IPCCA division within

520
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:49,060
The United Nations and John Coleman will talk about that

521
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,060
I got to play it at least up to that bid for it

522
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,060
It's like another minute and a half in

523
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,060
They came out with a report, the report

524
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,060
To get the movie and inconvenient truth from Al Gore

525
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:04,060
And that within a span of two years has given us these

526
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,060
Outrages carbon taxes on anything you do

527
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,060
Including farting cows

528
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,060
This is nuts

529
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,060
That's why this is really important

530
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:17,060
And it's amazing that this has not been mainstream news

531
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,060
I mean, this is a definitely a credible guy saying this

532
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,060
Just as credible as anyone else I would presume

533
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,060
And it goes nowhere, you got to embed this video

534
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,060
This thing has to ask to really how many views

535
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,060
8,246 is like nothing

536
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,060
A zero views, embed this thing

537
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,060
We got to get this thing going viral for sure

538
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:44,060
So you're not in a panic over the iceberg's melting

539
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,060
And sea levels rising

540
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,060
I promise you, 20 years from today

541
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,060
I'll be the one this laughing

542
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,060
The icebergs, the ice caps, the poles

543
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,060
They're not going to mouth the oceans

544
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,060
They're not going to flood the coast

545
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,060
People are not going to die

546
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,060
We're not going to have global climate change

547
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,060
That cuts off the food supply

548
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,060
We're not going to have thousands of species eliminated

549
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,060
As they lose their habitat

550
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,060
Now of course not

551
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,060
It's all one big joke

552
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,060
One big joke being played on us

553
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,060
And the next carbon credits

554
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,060
This is what a plan, huh?

555
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,060
What a plan

556
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,060
I mean you almost can't, how can you even plan for something like this?

557
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,060
These guys must be taking advantage of a great situation

558
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,060
Get the report out, that must have been planned

559
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,060
Make it really dumb

560
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,060
To end lie

561
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:39,060
And force your hand in there, force your agenda

562
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,060
Then start to build, you know, taxes on it

563
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,060
Then make it virtual by making it carbon credits

564
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,060
And then turn that into money

565
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,060
That's next, you watch

566
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,060
None of these things is going to happen

567
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,060
The earth is going to, the climate is going to change

568
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,060
With cycles of the sun

569
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,060
And with ocean currents

570
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,060
And we're all going to do just fine

571
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:05,060
But now war has a very convincing video

572
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,060
Out there that seems to show that

573
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,060
We're really facing a content

574
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,060
You should see his face

575
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
He's like grimacing is going

576
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,060
Oh man, there's outgoer question again

577
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,060
It's so nice that it's not me talking about this

578
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,060
This is finally someone else who is very articulate here

579
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,060
Saying exactly what this is

580
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,060
Namely a scam

581
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,060
I'm part of all the world of the hype

582
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,060
The media is full of it every day

583
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,060
I'll grow up in Nobel Peace Prize

584
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,060
And Oscar and a Grammy

585
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,060
And apparently millions of dollars

586
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:42,060
I believe is sincere in his belief

587
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,060
But also misguided

588
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,060
As is the entire UNIPCC

589
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,060
The internet and governmental panel

590
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,060
I'm climate change

591
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,060
Here it is

592
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,060
It's a specific panel set up to deliver the report

593
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,060
That we have global warming

594
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,060
Subsequently called climate change

595
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,060
Because of course we're freezing our ass off

596
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,060
Over here in Europe

597
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,060
Well, that doesn't bring us to the point

598
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,060
That Mr. Gore makes

599
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,060
And many others that science has spoken

600
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,060
There is a universal consensus

601
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,060
Among scientists

602
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,060
So to look at the history of the IPCC

603
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,060
It was formed by people who's

604
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,060
agendas were of

605
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,060
Question

606
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,060
And they really wanted to

607
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,060
Get back at the industrialized nations

608
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,060
And get them to pay patents

609
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,060
To the third world nations

610
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,060
For their pollution of the atmosphere

611
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,060
They're industrialized to be

612
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,060
Exactly a bunch of overzealous

613
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,060
Greeney sitting there saying

614
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,060
Let's go stick it to him

615
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,060
But really they were programmed

616
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,060
They've been misused

617
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:49,060
To get to these carbon tax and carbon credits

618
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,060
That's what it was all for

619
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,060
It was the little guys picking on the big guys

620
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,060
For a common in the UN

621
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,060
And it was from people who had

622
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,060
A world government in mind

623
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,060
That history is pretty well documented

624
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,060
People who had world government in mind

625
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,060
There you go

626
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,060
He's saying it right there

627
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,060
They used it

628
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,060
They wanted to get to one government

629
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,060
World government how do you get there

630
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,060
You start with the money

631
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,060
Chuggle heads

632
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,060
By an engineer named Alan Cheetham

633
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,060
He is really dug into it

634
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,060
And that panel

635
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,060
So you create this bureau

636
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,060
Within the UN

637
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,060
On climate change

638
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,060
Well it's mission

639
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,060
And its existence then

640
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,060
Is to prove that there's climate change

641
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,060
So it starts hiring scientists

642
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,060
And giving them research money

643
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,060
To want to prove that its mission is valid

644
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,060
Prove its point

645
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,060
Exactly

646
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,060
And all of this

647
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,060
And then it's meeting

648
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,060
And it does publicity

649
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,060
And the whole thing just

650
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,060
Christianity and bills

651
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,060
Now

652
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,060
Was there a consensus of

653
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,060
2,500 scientists

654
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,060
At the ballet meeting

655
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,060
Oh, this is so important

656
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,060
This is so important

657
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,060
Listen to this

658
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,060
Listen to this

659
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,060
Sponsor

660
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,060
The key

661
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,060
Paragraphs

662
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,060
For chapters

663
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
Of this report

664
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,060
And the research documents behind it

665
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,060
Which are very impressive

666
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,060
Our

667
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,060
Not anything that we're widely read

668
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,060
By these scientists

669
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,060
They were many of them

670
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,060
We're political scientists as it were

671
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,060
We're scientists who have

672
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,060
A political mission

673
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,060
Representatives are from Greenpeace

674
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,060
And the Sierra Club

675
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,060
From government ministries

676
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,060
In addition to some more meaning scientists

677
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,060
But it appears that only about

678
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,060
25 scientists

679
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,060
Out of that

680
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,060
500

681
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,060
Actually read and reviewed

682
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,060
In a scientific manner

683
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,060
A peer review

684
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,060
The key chapter

685
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,060
On radio

686
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,060
Defourcing by carbon dioxide

687
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,060
Causing climate change

688
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,060
Okay

689
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,060
I could go on

690
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,060
I could listen to this for hours

691
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,060
And I really urge it

692
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,060
Let's embed this thing

693
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,060
This thing is got to go viral

694
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,060
This is really important

695
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,060
This is really really critical stuff

696
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
This is

697
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,060
Obviously

698
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,060
What is proof

699
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,060
But this is a very strong witness

700
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,060
Very strong testimony

701
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,060
That this whole thing is a scam

702
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,060
With a one-world government agenda

703
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,060
And we know that the name

704
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,060
It went from global warming

705
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,060
Oops, that's not working

706
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,060
Because it's actually cooling down

707
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,060
In many places

708
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,060
Let's just call it climate change

709
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,060
Well indeed

710
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,060
We just had one of the

711
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,060
I don't know if it was

712
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,060
Record-breaking but certainly

713
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,060
Uncharacteristically

714
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,060
Early snow

715
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,060
We had it just the day before

716
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,060
I arrived

717
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,060
In October

718
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,060
Thousands of people without power

719
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,060
That was a horrible accident

720
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,060
On the motorway here

721
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
I mean it is getting colder

722
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,060
You know all of this is

723
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,060
The just changing the words

724
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,060
The changing everything on us

725
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:47,060
Trying to manipulate around

726
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,060
The big why

727
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,060
And we need to call him out on it

728
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,060
Come on

729
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,060
That's a word good

730
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,060
On the interwebs

731
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,060
Aren't we calling you out

732
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,060
I'm going to call you out on this

733
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,060
Oh look

734
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,060
It's so cold

735
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,060
It's raining

736
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,060
We are going to go

737
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,060
And we got the news

738
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,060
We are going to listen

739
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,060
Get ready

740
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,060
Oh, you're coming

741
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,060
And leave us on the road

742
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,060
And hope

743
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,060
All right

744
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,060
It's rising

745
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,060
Oh

746
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,060
Right

747
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,060
I'll just get low

748
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,060
How low

749
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,060
Oh, girl

750
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,060
I'll just get low

751
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,060
I'll just get low

752
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,060
I'll just get low

753
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,060
Oh, girl

754
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,060
I'll just get low

755
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,060
I'll just get low

756
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:35,060
I'll just get low

757
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,060
I'll just get low

758
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,060
I'll just get low

759
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,060
So my eyes are filled

760
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,060
And Oh, girl

761
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,060
I'll just get low

762
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,060
I'll just get low

763
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,060
I'll just get low

764
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,060
I'll just get low

765
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,060
Okay

766
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,560
Okay

767
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,060
I'll go

768
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,060
I'm going to go

769
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:01,820
After the last weekend, it's raining

770
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,560
Hallelujah, it's raining

771
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,200
Everything's not so wet

772
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,600
Oh, run, don't need

773
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,940
Don't run, don't run, don't need

774
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,440
Don't run, run, don't need

775
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,440
Don't share the same love, one, two, one

776
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,540
She does not care about

777
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:31,140
If you get away, see her to the floor

778
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,440
She's my average girl

779
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,440
She really is the sky

780
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,440
So that we can't everyone

781
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,440
The farmer from the sky

782
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,940
Who is raining again?

783
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,440
Hate your flap

784
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,660
Livin' strike, sim

785
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:59,380
And Livin''s grizzling Hey, listen

786
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,280
Hey, hold us get loose

787
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,500
One, two, one, don't run, don't run

788
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,340
Don't watch ya'll walk off that side

789
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,520
All in a circus

790
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,760
All in a circus

791
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,800
Places in place too, run

792
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,320
Oh, run, run, don't raise

793
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,520
Drop the ball, head back to you

794
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,120
I'm lost, I'm in the hands of the radio

795
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:33,320
Cause I'm on a side and I'm on a side and I'm on a side

796
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,520
I am lost, oh, ommm

797
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,240
I I'm lost, yo, I'm in the hands of the radio

798
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,420
I am lost, I'm in the warehouse

799
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,440
I am lost, yo, I'm in the front

800
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:55,720
I am lost, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh My God, I tell you, I later

801
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:10,720
I got to tell you, I was tempted, tempted to even continue listening to that interview.

802
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,720
While the weather girls were playing because man is such high quality, it's so awesome.

803
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,720
And just the way the guy talks is great.

804
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,720
Do yourself a favor and take a look at that.

805
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,720
That's a conversation I'm going to take on for a little bit longer here on the Charney.

806
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,720
Because it seems to be connected to a lot of other things.

807
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
Major, massive scan.

808
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,720
All right, let's stop the bad weather.

809
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,720
Part of, of course, what's going on is the big bail out.

810
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,720
And this is an article from New York Times that caught my attention.

811
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:47,720
I believe it was displayed on the drop from drop.io slash daily source code.

812
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,720
It is known as Sarah.

813
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,720
Jonah Sarah, sorry, from October 24th.

814
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,720
So a couple days ago, titled so when will banks give loans?

815
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,720
Oh man, you're going to love this.

816
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,720
Chase Manhattan recently received $25 billion in federal funding.

817
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,720
What effects will that have on the business side and will it change our strategic lending policy?

818
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
It was October 17th.

819
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,720
It's nice little story this.

820
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,720
Just four days after JP Morgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Diamond.

821
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,720
Jamie Diamond.

822
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,720
Cool name.

823
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:29,720
Jamie Diamond agreed to take a $25 billion capital injection courtesy of the United States government.

824
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,720
When a JP Morgan employee asked that question,

825
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,720
it came toward the end of an employee only conference call that had been largely devoted to

826
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,720
meshing certain divisions of JP Morgan with this new acquisition watched the mutual.

827
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,720
So what's going on, this is an employee conference call.

828
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,720
These things take place all the time.

829
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:53,720
And a reporter got a hold of the number and called in and listened in.

830
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:00,720
And here's what was discussed.

831
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,720
Here's what was said in that conference call.

832
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,720
So this is our money.

833
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,720
I just want you to know what's happening with it.

834
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,720
All quotes.

835
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,720
$25 billion is obviously going to help the folks who are struggling more than Chase he began.

836
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,720
What we do think it will help us do is perhaps be a little bit more active on the acquisition side or

837
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,720
opportunistic side for some banks who are still struggling.

838
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,720
And I would not assume that we are done on the acquisition side just because of the

839
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,720
Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns mergers.

840
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,720
I think they're going to be some great opportunities for us to grow in this environment.

841
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,720
And I think we have an opportunity to use that $25 billion in that way.

842
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:40,720
And obviously depending on whether recession turns into deep pressure or what happens in the future.

843
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,720
You know, we have that as a backstop.

844
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,720
So you need to go read this article.

845
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,720
The article even says read that answers many times as you want.

846
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,720
The question being, what are going to do with the $25 billion?

847
00:44:53,720 --> 00:45:02,720
You're not going to find a single word in there about making loans to help the American economy on the contrary.

848
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:10,720
At another point in the conference call, the same executive who the reporters not naming because he didn't know he was listening in makes sense.

849
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,720
Explain that loan dollars are down significantly.

850
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:22,720
He added, we would think that loan volume will continue to go down as we continue to tighten credit to fully reflect the high cost of pricing on the loan side.

851
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,720
In other words, JPMorgan has no intention of turning on the lending,

852
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,720
spigot whatsoever.

853
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,720
So one can only presume that they were just lying to us once again about what this bailout was for.

854
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:42,720
They've just all strengthened their balance sheet to the and their batting down the hatches and getting ready for what's happening next with our money.

855
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,720
And we're still paying $2 per transaction fees at the ATM.

856
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,720
It is despicable.

857
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,720
I'm proud of the casting.

858
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,720
I'm proud of this.

859
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,720
You say it.

860
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,720
It's just.

861
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,720
It's just.

862
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,720
Young pole.

863
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,720
Hey, Adam.

864
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,720
Hi, doing.

865
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,720
You said that me having a cold edition of the latest number 145.

866
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,720
And we're going to start right away with intro number one.

867
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,720
Hi.

868
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,720
Morning, Mr. Radio.

869
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,720
That a, that, that, that.

870
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,720
I think it's algebra.

871
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,720
Morning, I think it's the title of the song.

872
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,720
Nice video when along with that.

873
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,720
Number two.

874
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,720
The thumb, thumb, thumb, bell stars.

875
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,720
Sign up at times.

876
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,720
Written by Prince.

877
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,720
I think.

878
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,720
Wow.

879
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,720
Could be.

880
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,720
And the final one is number three.

881
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,720
Boom.

882
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,720
Okay.

883
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,720
Michael Jackson want to be starting something.

884
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,720
Young.

885
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,720
A perfect mix for this footballer Friday, the Halloween edition.

886
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,720
I think I got six out of six stars.

887
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,720
It's time for the answers.

888
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,720
And this week they're all from.

889
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,720
I think I need to read it.

890
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,720
Just.

891
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,720
Yeah.

892
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,720
This is answer number one.

893
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,720
This is algebra.

894
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,720
Morning.

895
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,720
On investor radio.

896
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,720
On investor radio.

897
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:16,720
On investor stereo.

898
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,720
On investor stereo.

899
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,720
Answer number one.

900
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,720
Algebra One.

901
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,720
And this is Anton number two, Bell Star.

902
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,720
Now hold.

903
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,720
I remember the question.

904
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,720
I remember the question.

905
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,720
The sign of time.

906
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,720
The music.

907
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,720
The sign of time.

908
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,720
Time to be alone.

909
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,720
The sign of time.

910
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,720
The music.

911
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,720
The sign of time.

912
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,720
The sign of time.

913
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,720
The sign of time.

914
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,720
Bell Star.

915
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,720
It's answering number two.

916
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,720
And this is Anton number three.

917
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,720
This is Michael Jackson.

918
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,720
There you go.

919
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,720
Yeah.

920
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,720
Yeah.

921
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,720
Yeah.

922
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,720
Yeah.

923
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,720
Yeah.

924
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,720
One of these guys.

925
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,720
One of these guys.

926
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,720
One of these guys.

927
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,720
Got it.

928
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,720
He's got it.

929
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:27,720
Michael Jackson want to be starting something.

930
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,720
And that concludes hit this number one, four, five.

931
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,720
So Adam.

932
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,720
Yeah.

933
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,720
How did you do this week?

934
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,720
Well, I got to say young.

935
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,720
I got six out of six.

936
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,720
I'm feeling pretty good.

937
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,720
It was about time.

938
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,720
Nice mix of songs all from my air.

939
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,720
I appreciate it.

940
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,720
The answer to this hit this.

941
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,720

947
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,720
Yeah.

948
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,720
Everyone else.

949
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,720

952

So until then, have fun.

953
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,720

955
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,720
Bye-bye.

Period.

971
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:53,720
Just to wind up talking about the financial crisis.

972
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:58,720
Which of course has been completely displaced here in the United Kingdom by the Russell Brands

973
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,720
of Jonathan Ross controversy.

974
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:06,720
By the way, I think the thing people might take advantage of that situation here.

975
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,720
Yesterday I told you how incredibly important this news is taking up 10 minutes of the top of the news

976
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,720
Cassie.

977
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:22,720
BBC, preempting anything about what's going on in the world, including US helicopters, killing people in Syria.

978
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,720
Yeah.

979
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,720
Yeah.

980
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,720
I think I might want to look into that one.

981
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,720
People have been talking about these guys who made some prank phone calls on the air.

982
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:37,720
And Jonathan Ross winds up getting suspended for 12 weeks.

983
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,720
And the brand guy, Russell Brand resigned.

984
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:46,720
They should have been kicked in the head for bad humor, bad comedy, a bad show.

985
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,720
You know, this whole Bruhahah is not necessary.

986
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:55,720
However, it does send another shockwave throughout the BBC, a hugely influential organization, of course,

987
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:02,720
because of just the sheer vastness of the authority they have in what they say and what they report.

988
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,720
So I think that, you know, it's very possible that people take advantage of this shock that goes through the company.

989
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,720
And it really, it alters the DNA.

990
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,720
It tightens the way I've been in these companies when these things happen.

991
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:20,720
You're very much like the Janet Jackson Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction episode, controversy.

992
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:28,720
You know, it really made everyone mind their peace and cues and their stuff that we'll not now be broadcast anymore in the BBC.

993
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,720
Believe me, not the comedy stuff, but other stuff.

994
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,720
Because it'll come down to say, hey, you know, this is not appropriate.

995
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,720
Or we don't do that around here or remember what happened to so-and-so.

996
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,720
These things do take place.

997
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:46,720
So maybe that is a part of the reason why it became such a big deal.

998
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,720
I don't know, because now they're talking about, you know, what is the use of the BBC?

999
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,720
You know, they're taking it way beyond the incident and they're taking it.

1000
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,720
What is the reason for existence if this is the infantile crap that our money is paying for?

1001
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,720
Fair question, of course.

1002
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,720
But keep your eye on that ball for sure.

1003
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:14,720
This is a report that I don't normally report on stuff that appears on info wars.com, Alex Jones the site.

1004
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,720
But this is exclusive to his crew.

1005
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:25,720
And I trust him enough having heard the story about how they actually obtained this information.

1006
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:32,720
This is about the Rand Corporation, which I guess I think the Rand Corporation is a think tank.

1007
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,720
They've been around for a long time. Let me just read this story.

1008
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,720
And I'll tell you this. Well, actually it may be the synopsis first.

1009
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:50,720
Apparently in the Chinese media, they are now reporting that the Rand Corporation has been and they represent the military industrial complex just to make it simple.

1010
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,720
Or parts of it.

1011
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:58,720
They've been lobbying the Pentagon to start a war with the significant enemy to save the U.S. economy.

1012
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:05,720
Which, of course, is, you know, then you crank up the economy because we're making more tanks and more airplanes and more death machines.

1013
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,720
And we sell them to all kinds of people.

1014
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:17,720
Also in the McCain and Obama plans, by the way, to continue selling weapons to other countries.

1015
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,720
Or arms dealers.

1016
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:27,720
So anyway, for this, according to reports out of top Chinese mainstream news outlets, the Rand Corporation recently presented a shocking proposal to the Pentagon.

1017
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:35,720
In which it lobbied for a war to be started with a major foreign power in attempt to stimulate the American economy and prevent a recession.

1018
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:42,720
A fierce debate has now ensued in China about who that foreign power may be with China itself as well as with Russia,

1019
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,720
even Japan's suspected to be the targets of aggression.

1020
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:53,720
This is pretty, this is pretty amazing. If this is true, if this is really true,

1021
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:58,720
we need to get some form of proof beyond info wars.com.

1022
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,720
There is a link to a Chinese news corporation website.

1023
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:11,720
We do have someone in the organization who can speak, I don't know if it's Chinese, Mandarin, whatever,

1024
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:20,720
but I'm going to get my own translation done because if this is true, that really does put a whole new color over the world.

1025
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:49,720
As time goes on, I realize just what you mean to me and now, not that you're near.

1026
00:54:49,720 --> 00:55:10,720
Promise your love that I've waited to share, and dreams of our moments together.

1027
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:32,720
Call of my world with hope of hope of hope.

1028
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:40,720
I don't know about you, but that worked for me, I'd qualify that story as officially scary,

1029
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,720
and why to prepare it for this Halloween edition of the Football Friday on the Daily Source Code,

1030
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,720
but have no fear because we're doing the right thing.

1031
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,720
We're getting the true information out.

1032
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:58,720
Collecting aggregating the mainstream news sources that never make it above the full that are buried away 16 pages deep.

1033
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:03,720
Show people what's really going on in their world, and they'll wake up.

1034
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:12,720
Hey, we got four years of somebody, and we'll be following every single step of the way.

1035
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:19,720
I look forward to talking to all of you tomorrow at no agenda, you can find the show at no agenda.

1036
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:29,720
And I do with the John C. Devore Act, until we speak again, my friends, enjoy your freedom and live your life with passion.

1037
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,720
Another fine, medium presentation, stick it in your ear.
