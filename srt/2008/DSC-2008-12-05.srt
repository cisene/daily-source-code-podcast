1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
What better way to start your day than with a hot cup of coffee, the financial times,

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,720
a little DSC-810.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,720
Well, you might want to go to the bathroom first.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,720
Here's Adam Curry, and the Daily Swordsman.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:37,280
I was $16 million worth of airplane straps by yesterday, and the next generation

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,600
radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,880
We don't need a speed increase in-

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,920
I like to think I'm trying to teach the intro-

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,560
I'm just taking this feeling curry.

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,640
So far, now I don't love when it's time to explain, but it seems like things are just

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,360
kind of insane because the world is crying, and nobody's listening so please leave

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,360
a message on my cell phone.

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,880
Let's see, while it's been there, the baby going well, and the guy on TV, it's like a

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,360
phone, and so why you wear it tonight, it's a never-definery surprise, but I'm taking you all

15
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:20,320
right now, she's so stupid, I don't know much, I don't know too much, but I know it, she

16
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:33,320
is what I love, it's what I love, it's what I love, it's what I love, it's what I love, I'm telling you,

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,940
what I love, it's what I love, it's what I love, it's heart is so bad

18
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:45,240
I love, it's just bugging like I love every parent,

19
00:01:45,240 --> 00:02:01,000
I love, it's what I love, it's what I love, nothing got below media, but saving the day,

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,820
Let me be new, still the bullshit views

21
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,420
I think we're losing this fight

22
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,260
Sponsored to fight, blood, light

23
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,220
Now we're walking the gas ball

24
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,060
Taking the black, jeans out of the bottle

25
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,780
And we can't put it back

26
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,900
I'm in love with someone

27
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,900
Well in my brain, can't see the storm coming

28
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,420
It's coming, it's way too much

29
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,420
I don't know too much

30
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,260
But I know this, she is what's on

31
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

32
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,900

I don't listen to you

38
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,060
She is walking

39
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,300
I love the guy

40
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,420

41
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,900

I don't care!

80
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:42,840
I don't care!

81
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,840
I don't care!

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,120
I don't care!

83
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,160
I don't care!

84
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,680
I don't care!

85
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,680
I don't care!

86
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,400
I don't care!

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,240
I love it.

88
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,620
That's a success is messed up.

89
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,520
Take these stars, Cody, eight Zero Nine.

90
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,440
Tell the shehred Charlie on every where hey, everybody, how you doing.

91
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,280
One show, Charlie this week, oh my goodness, not a very good record.

92
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,800
But all for a good cause first of all, welcome to the show, David Source Coda, as I said,

93
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,560
episode 809, we're getting up there on the numbers these days.

94
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,240
Beautiful day in the affluent suburb of Suri known as Gilbert in the, in the curry

95
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,160
Remember, I see blue skies, couple clouds, nice and cold, the perfect flying weather.

96
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Of course, I'm going absolutely nowhere.

97
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,640
Lady Patricia is on her way to the Netherlands for her two live shows this weekend.

98
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,840
Next weekend, she'll have off and then the weekend after that is the finale.

99
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,960
The grand finale, I'm actually going to fly over Comheller Highwater, hopefully with the

100
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,920
Delta Sierra, if not with the Juliet echo, with the echo Juliet.

101
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,280
Actually it's echo Zulu as their code, which is easy jet.

102
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,280
My favorite airline when I fly.

103
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,600
Well, what's been going on is, it's just been crazy busy.

104
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,760
Of course, the move is starting to spin up, we got the keys to the new Casa, which I think

105
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,200
indeed is going to be named the Curry Terrace, it just has nice ring to it.

106
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,360
No illiteration, unfortunately, I'll just have to live with it.

107
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:21,520
I got a great office, I cannot wait, so this is, of course, as a terrace house in London.

108
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,880
Very typical, and so you have a, you walk up a short flight of steps to walk into the

109
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,880
house and then that's where you have the living room and we've got an overhang and

110
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,000
conservatory at the back, and it's really fantastic, you can also walk down the steps

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,520
from the front or internally, of course.

112
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,480
And on the, I guess that would be the Sutara, is at the back is a huge kitchen with another

113
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,880
aga, which I'm very happy about, because we've gotten quite used to the aga cooking.

114
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,120
If you've never seen this, look it up, A.G.A. of Gulf of Alph, the aga oven, often discussed

115
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,040
on Noah Genda with my friend, John C. to Warach.

116
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,880
Of course, we've got the teenager apartment out back, which is right outside of the kitchen,

117
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,760
so, you know, she can come in and get her midnight snacks, and we have the whole house

118
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
to ourselves.

119
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:17,160
Now, on the front of that is where I get my new office, it's probably in size, it is probably

120
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,240
somewhat smaller than the attic here, because this is kind of a rectangular shape, but

121
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,760
it has very high ceilings, which I desperately need, because I've been doing, finally,

122
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,320
I'm getting into video production.

123
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,120
It has taken me several years of focusing a lot of attention on the management sales,

124
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
etc.

125
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,480
So, we're at a place now, we got our new CEO Jeff Carpin, I really got to get him on the

126
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,960
show, we've just, you know, we've been all over the map, getting stuff done.

127
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,240
So finally, I can get into some production, you've probably seen at mevio.com every

128
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
single day.

129
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,120
There's a new little, at these days, it's like three minutes, three, four minutes,

130
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,120
highlighting stuff that's new on across our four networks for that day, so that's men, women,

131
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,200
music, and tech, you can play those channels, they roll out one after another, it's literally

132
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:12,080
in one of our channel systems, so one show, one episode plays after another, I'm very happy

133
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,600
with it, advertisers are happy with it, and it's looking cool.

134
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,640
So now I want to get into video production, and it's been, at least, what has it been,

135
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:25,600
five, almost six years since I blast work with the final cod pro, probably version 2.3,

136
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
or something like that.

137
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,320
Well, they're up to version 6, and I will reiterate what I said many years ago, the

138
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,320
guys over at Apple who work on Final Cut Pro, or really Final Cut Studio, I should say,

139
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,800
because that includes live type, motion, color, you know, you have your cinemas tools,

140
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,400
which I don't use obviously, but as soundtrack, pro, how it all works together, these guys,

141
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,800
they are smoking good dope, and they should be sharing it, because whenever I'm thinking,

142
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,320
if only I could do this, it pops up as a possibility.

143
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,720
The thing that has really been just so incredibly daunting is understanding the formats,

144
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,720
the sizes, the compression, the compressors, to use, and I have to say, good old Dexter,

145
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,360
Christina's boyfriend has really been helpful, and he's, he's helped me, he's set up some

146
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,080
lights here, which, I got the new lights in now, I was basically using the equivalent

147
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,280
of desk lamps, I still don't have an official, green screen, I've been using this

148
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,400
blue window shade that I found at home base, which is kind of, you know,

149
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,520
as a home home improvement store, and I hung it up right behind me, right behind the desk,

150
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,920
and so I've got that actually, it's still Dexter's camera, I've got one of our HD cameras

151
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:41,240
coming in. This is just regular DV, big red hat light, and it's been a lot of fun

152
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,800
figuring out how to do this, and it's just given me so many ideas of things I want to do,

153
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,680
I'm thinking of two shows that I want to put together, one is tentatively titled,

154
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,320
my gear, because I've got so much gear, and people are always talking about it. Why don't

155
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,960
just do a show where I show you my gear and show you how I use it, how I have it set up.

156
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,280
So, not like a feature review show of all, here's what the new Nokia can do,

157
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,440
now, but show you how I use the system, how I use my phone, how I use my

158
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,320
certain types of software on my computer, but it can also range from my airplane.

159
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,720
We can do an episode about that, it can be anything. So, my gear, I think, is a one show I

160
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,680
want to put together, the other one, which kind of came to me last night, since a lot of people

161
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:31,000
have been asking me to do a politically oriented video show, particularly at HQ, they've been asking

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,040
about this, because they listen to the DSC, it's going to say DHL, they listen to the DSC,

163
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,040
and they say, I can't you do like some kind of video thing, and I'm thinking, yes, and it hit me.

164
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,800
They work for us, that's the tentative title of the show, and it's going to be perfect, because

165
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,880
there's so much video, official news video, which I can use under the auspices of fair use for

166
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,360
news, and they work for us, will be a news oriented show with commentary.

167
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,720
And I'll show all the, every episode, I'll show one crazy video where you can see what

168
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,920
government is really doing, particularly what they're saying. The stuff that we talk about all the

169
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,280
time, the stuff that is on C-SPAN, but that never airs on the news. There's a lot of that over here

170
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,840
in Europe too, a lot of stuff being recorded in the European Parliament that never makes it on

171
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,800
a mainstream television. So it's that kind of stuff that I'm working on. So that shouldn't have,

172
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,440
you know, so yes, it's been hours every single day, and I, you know, I got all set up, I got a huge

173
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,120
terabyte drives, I've got my USB hub, I'm really getting my shit together, got the wireless mouse

174
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,800
out of, and using the trackpad on the, on the laptop, I've got a, you know, huge mega honker,

175
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,440
quad processor, G5, whatever, coming with dual screens. I won't use that until we're in the new

176
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:55,800
place, but I've had set up there. Nice cup of tea. I even got my old, uh, Maharashi mouse pad out.

177
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,120
I got to take a picture of that. That'll be a part of my gear. I'll show you that, my Maharagi

178
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,840
mouse pad. It's more than just a mouse pad. It's a, it's a lifestyle experience.

179
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,240
So none of that should have really slowed down at least one show earlier this week. We're

180
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,720
at not for my dear friend, Michelle Harper, uh, outstanding citizen in Gilford, uh, who was

181
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,320
run a business here for 17 years known as, currently known as Harper's, but he has several, he has

182
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,760
an entertainment complex, right in the middle of the, um, of the industrial part of town,

183
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,720
or the, I should say, the, um, we're the offices are. So, you know, in a, in a good location,

184
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,960
fantastic parking. Now he has Harper's, which is a nightclub. He's got barmombo. He's got, uh,

185
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,000
the lines, then, which is the lap dancing club, which, if you have not heard that edition of

186
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,320
Noah Genda last, uh, yeah, last Saturday, John C. Dubork, and I talked about a Noah Genda that

187
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,080
mevido, mevio.com, uh, very different from other lap dancing clubs I've been into. And I,

188
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,120
you know, and myself and the lady Patricia, we're, uh, we're a big, big fans of this. It's, uh,

189
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,160
it's stress relief. It's, uh, we believe it's good for guys, and, and it is completely a, um,

190
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,080
a feminine power trip. If you, if you ask me, that's my personal, uh, experiences that, uh,

191
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,880
when, when, when that's, when there's lap dance time, uh, the women performing the lap dance is

192
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,920
in total control, which is kind of, I think, what guys like about it. It's probably a lot

193
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,640
less sexual than it is just about control. And sex may be all about control, I guess. Anyway,

194
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,840
you probably know through listening to this show over the past four, five years that, you know,

195
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,520
I've, I've learned a lot about, uh, certainly in the United Kingdom about the councils,

196
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,680
and the councils have a tremendous amount of power in this country. They can order telephone,

197
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:52,120
taps, email, taps, uh, route through your postal mail. They can do all kinds of nasty things.

198
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,960
Plenty of news articles about that on the source code drop, uh, which, uh, please take a look at it.

199
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:04,920
If you're new to this, drop.io slash daily source code. Man, we're doing seven pages a day of

200
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:11,080
information, and it's all good. There's no way I could, I could go through the 20, 20 to 25 pages

201
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,240
from the past week, which I, you know, it's just, you can't catch up. There's, there's, there's no way

202
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,960
to do it unless I was doing this show daily, which, uh, it could ever be this long. That's for sure.

203
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:26,920
Anyway, so he was, um, called to the Gilford Hall, which, um, is right in the middle of the

204
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:36,040
high street for a hearing regarding, um, his license. Um, they want to review of his license.

205
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,280
So it was licensed to operate as a, as an entertainment center to serve alcohol, etc, etc.

206
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,400
And it's not, it was not a, and this is why I was so fascinated and I went to the proceedings.

207
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:55,240
It is a, a hearing by the leaders of the council. So it's not a judge, not a jury, but yet,

208
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,760
they are going to determine whether there should be a review of his license. So they have legal

209
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:08,280
powers, of course. Um, and this was brought on by the Surrey police. If you can believe that,

210
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,200
the Surrey police say that there is so much violence and uncooperative behavior from his door

211
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,960
staff, that, uh, they believe that what's going on inside must be 10 times worse than what they're

212
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:26,360
seeing outside. And therefore his license should be under review. Again, Mr. Harper's been here for

213
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,520
17 years. And, and, and, and, and, big disclaimer, I love this guy. He crashed like Christmas

214
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,840
party about a year ago. He's introduced to me by another friend of mine, the Super Agent Keith

215
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:41,720
they ship. And, uh, lovely guy. And we stated his house in France, uh, we've met his mom, you know,

216
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,200
we're almost boyfriend and boyfriend. But he's, uh, he, he's a good guy. He's an entrepreneur and a

217
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,000
very free thinking spirit. And, uh, if you live anywhere in Surrey, you've probably seen him in the

218
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,120
Surrey advertiser regularly. Because he fights it. He fights them all the time. All the time. And,

219
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,320
and that's probably what, you know, what clicked about us both the most. He's a real doer man.

220
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,720
He says screw it. He'll go out and he'll, and he'll fight. So, um, now they've, uh, they took

221
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,480
them to the Guild Hall, which is where they used to hang people in the high street right outside, uh,

222
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,720
from, uh, there's a balcony there. We were actually in that balcony room, which I'm sure was the room where

223
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:30,360
they sent people to the gallows. And, um, and, you know, it wasn't a legal proceeding yet, you know,

224
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:38,760
they acted like one. But the thing that really freaked me out as I was sitting there is right at the

225
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:45,640
beginning. They started with all the CCTV. They had a presentation. They had a whole screen set up.

226
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,560
They had multiple shots, 10 different movies, slow, slow mo versions, and let me tell you.

227
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:59,160
This shit is like television. We're talking full 24, 25 frames a second, panning, zooming the whole

228
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,840
deal. However, no audio. And, um, and of course, only one perspective that not switching back and forth

229
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:15,160
between shots. But, but what blew me away is how the, uh, the, the lawyer for the police,

230
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,480
how he set up each video. He would tell you what happened inside the club based upon accounts

231
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,480
from the people who were ejected from the club. Who, of course, were drunk in 99.9 of the

232
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:37,720
cases and gave drunk testimony and exaggerated. He didn't mention any, any, um, counter, um, or cross-examination

233
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,000
information from the, the staff. And I know all the staff. I've met them all, you know, they're

234
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,320
good guys. And you know what? They kick, drunks out. It's like that. And if they assault them, they'll

235
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,200
assault back. I mean, it's nightclub business. It's, I've been around this all my life. This is the way

236
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:58,680
it goes. In fact, two officers testified on the spot, um, in this hearing, which was not a court

237
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,480
proceeding and said, uh, yeah, no, it's the same everywhere. It's not like, uh, like, as any different,

238
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,960
which is kind of funny. I think they, they didn't get the memo as to what they were supposed to

239
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:14,120
maybe they're afraid because these are the guys on the street. So then the, uh, so this, uh,

240
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,920
this lawyer, he would set it all up and get you in a frame of mind and then roll the video and then

241
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:24,520
give play by play. There's no sound. He's providing the voice over. It was exactly the way

242
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:31,560
reality television is made and it was certainly not honest. And how can it be factual at all?

243
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,400
You're just seeing shit. You know, there's, uh, one scene, which is where dormant, you know,

244
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,440
so it's like this dormant grabbed her cell phone camera because this girl was, uh, video taping

245
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,160
him, uh, being abusive. And he took the camera and smashed it on the ground. And then you see the

246
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,920
video, you couldn't tell from the perspective, but I could see basically just from experience looking

247
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,560
at it. She had it maybe four inches away from his face. I mean, that's intrusive and it's

248
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,040
and then after like a minute, he grabs it and smashes it on the ground. Look, I'm not defending

249
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:08,520
one way or the other. What blew me away is the use of CCTV footage in basically railroading this guy.

250
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:15,160
Now, there are two things that play. The reason why the police are doing this and specifically

251
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:21,960
against his bouncer's his door staff is because all of Gilford, uh, and perhaps all of

252
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:29,400
sorry for all I know, uses bouncer's and security staff from one firm, from one security firm.

253
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,760
Mr. Harper does not because he wants to have his own people and they all, they all are under,

254
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,640
you know, whatever guidance of the security industry administration or whatever they have to be licensed,

255
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,000
et cetera, et cetera. But of course, you would expect that this one company that provides all the

256
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:51,320
bouncing staff is filled with X-Cops and it's the cops who are bringing this against him. So

257
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,440
we know what that's about. He basically get rid of all your bouncer's bringing the guys that we

258
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:03,480
pre-approved, a disgusting display, literally disgusting, but what made it even crazier is this

259
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:12,600
insatiable, um, quest by the, and all women I might add, all women, and women you wouldn't touch

260
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,200
with a ten-foot dick that belonged to a guy on the other side of the earth. Just, uh, and you just

261
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:25,000
want to, you know what I mean? It's, hey, I, I just, I'm not, I mean, look at them.

262
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,520
Whew, which is tough for me because I can always find something beautiful in all women, but

263
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:39,320
I, I found them to be incredibly evil. And they want, I'm to make a long story short. They were

264
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:46,600
saying, look, you, cctv, because, you know, they say, one of the complaints was, well, the cameras you

265
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,880
have in the club, you know, they're not sufficient. There's no obligation, by the way, under the 2003

266
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:58,120
licensing act, to have cameras inside the club. Michelle Harper has about 40 of them, mainly at

267
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,320
cast registers, coat checks, you know, really for his customers, security that people aren't

268
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:09,480
ripping them off, and a couple of the door. But this was really all about these women who lead

269
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,040
the council and can phone tap you, do whatever you want, they want the cameras inside the

270
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,480
lap dancing club. That's what they want, and it really came down to that, we want cameras inside

271
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:26,760
the lap dancing club, because, and this came out today, and then it also, and that all, it all

272
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:35,480
clicked together for me. I, well, actually, I guess it happened yesterday. In the, um, what does it

273
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,520
the Queens? I don't know what the hell it's called. They had something in Parliament, and they're

274
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:45,560
talking about what, you know, what laws are coming and what they're going to do, they want a crack

275
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:51,640
down on lap dancing clubs as an article in the show notes. It's actually an old article from

276
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,240
2008, but this was, I just read it in the times yesterday. Um, you know, councils are powerless to

277
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,200
stop the spread of lap dancing clubs and licensing laws need to be tightened up. They want to, um,

278
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,960
they want anyone who has a lap dancing club to be licensed under a sexual encounter club,

279
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:20,840
i.e. a brothel, and, you know, the things are saying, lap dancing clubs are in contradiction

280
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,520
to efforts to promote gender equality. You know what, there has to be an end somewhere to the stupidity

281
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:35,400
of this. It is, it is an emotional stress relief. And by the way, I think women would enjoy the

282
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,080
same benefits of lap dancing, but there's not enough of them that actually, you know, do it,

283
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,240
go to lap dancing clubs, you know, or there's not enough clubs, obviously at Chip and Dales, but

284
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,480
and by the way, in all honesty, the penis is not a very attractive thing to look at.

285
00:21:52,680 --> 00:22:01,960
So, I think women, most women think that as well. But, um, it really gave me an insight into

286
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:08,360
what is going on in the United Kingdom and, and where it's going, you know, this along with, uh,

287
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,680
with now arresting people who frequent, uh, or make use of sex workers, um, if they are

288
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:21,000
under slave trade. Of course, that's horrible, but please go after the slave traders and

289
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,160
not the Johns who are just out there for more stress relief. And obviously, I'm not saying that all

290
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:33,640
prostitution is is good times, but the extent that this is, this can only lead to one thing

291
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:42,200
to domestic violence, increase domestic violence, rape, just just Sodom and Gamora and violence

292
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:49,240
in general amongst the civil public. And I've lived in countries where prostitution is legal,

293
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:56,440
and of course, lap dancing is no issue at all, such as the Netherlands, very, very low, domestic

294
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:04,680
violence, rape, very low in teenage pregnancies, very low in rape. Meanwhile, it's the same

295
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:12,840
story police who killed a guy in Guilford, killed him, an unarmed man, oh, it looked like he had a

296
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:19,720
gun right outside the Guilford, because the usual guy was very confused, he was depressed according

297
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:28,120
to his family, and they, you know, we that choppers chasing him for an hour, and then when they

298
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:34,840
finally caught up with him, put a cap in his ass, killed him, killed him, a man without a weapon,

299
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:47,160
killed him. So they work for us, I guess, is, uh, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, my batteries

300
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,480
are hold out for the entire show, it's going to be a long one, my friends, like very long one,

301
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,400
dear Mr. Corridor, yes, I have listened to several episodes of your podcast, no agenda, yes, I must

302
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:03,160
commend the war act on his excellent work, from what I've heard thus far, I must say that you often

303
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:09,640
come across as an egocentric asshole, you seem to think you are American, Dutch, and British, yes,

304
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,440
I understand you have lived in each of those countries, yes, however, you will not British in

305
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,160
the slightest sense, oh, and it's insulting that you would ever try to insinuate that you are,

306
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,480
okay, just listen to yourself, yes, and that's so called English that spews from your mouth,

307
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:31,000
you talk us a rubbish, you are an idiot, yes, you are disgusting, yes, I hope one day you can see

308
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,280
how much of a scumbag you really are, you know what, you really tell you really made my day, thank you so much,

309
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:46,440
Gives me some, with my car, hi Adam, it's Matt from Gamesweasel on this week's show, I'll

310
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:52,280
review left for dead on the Xbox 360, take a look at Guitar Hero World Tour on the PlayStation 3,

311
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,080
you can win copies of Prince of Persia for the 360, and I'll look at the best casual party games

312
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,320
for Christmas Day to play on your PlayStation 3, that's all a Gamesweasel.com.

313
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:15,880
There's no main priest's voice, just he's a legend, it's no instead, there ain't no plan to walk,

314
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:35,000
so we'll just shoot you in the end.

315
00:25:35,000 --> 00:26:04,840
Yeah, that's what they want you to think, man, that's what they want you to think, man.

316
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:12,600
They're pirates, I, oh, the dog is unhappy downstairs. Well, you're in for a long sit, because I got

317
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:19,560
a long way to go. A couple more things about the UK, and I talked about this on Saturday with

318
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:24,360
John, as well as you haven't heard about it, it's really important to look into what is happening

319
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:32,360
here where an opposition minister of parliament was arrested. His home search by the terrorist

320
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,800
anti-terrorist brigade, because, well, essentially, because he's leaking out the shit that the current

321
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:47,160
incumbent government is doing, all the mistakes, and Jackie Smith, the home office, what is

322
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:55,640
her name? Home office secretary or whatever? Like homeland defense. She's in charge of the police,

323
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,200
essentially. She's denying everything, oh, I didn't know about it, if I didn't know about it,

324
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,240
you know, it's important. This is what, this is the stuff that happened before the second

325
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,040
world war, my friends. And it's happening here in the United Kingdom. I know the good article,

326
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,280
which I won't, I won't read, but I do want you to take a look at link in the show notes at

327
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:20,680
dailysourcecode.com, also across post that are curried.com, from the Daily Mail, which is, there's a

328
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:26,040
lot of good stuff in the Daily Mail, or the mail online, but it's from the Daily Mail, Richard

329
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,720
Little John, title of this. If I'm not here on Friday, you'll know I've been nicked,

330
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:36,040
which is basically saying exactly what I just said. Hey, you know, if you go against the government,

331
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:41,560
you'll get arrested. And this is what they're doing. It's actually taking place. And a YouTube

332
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:47,080
video as well, which you must have a look at, it is fantastic. And she could actually be right

333
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,880
on the gilford council. You'll take a look at her, you'll take a look at her, and you'll say,

334
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:59,640
oh my god, he's so right. He did when the dog does, you know, the house is empty.

335
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:06,920
Maybe it's the window washer possible. Well, he gets all up. He's too old to get that upset. I

336
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,800
wish you wouldn't do that. Also, according to the Daily Mail, just to show you how the

337
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:20,520
crunch is progressing here in the United Kingdom. Thousands of homes worth 250,000 a year in the United

338
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:29,880
Kingdom now up for sale for under 100,000 pounds, unbelievable what is happening with the prices

339
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:41,000
of housing, unbelievable. And this is, uh, uh, there's something wrong with my, uh, my wireless mouse here.

340
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,200
I'm going to have to stop this recording, go downstairs, and talk to the dog in a minute, because

341
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,920
it's really putting me off. Thousands of internet users have been told they'll be taken to court

342
00:28:52,920 --> 00:29:00,760
unless they pay hundreds of pounds. That's, uh, these days only $147 for illegally downloading and

343
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:07,320
sharing hardcore porn movies. Yeah, just when you thought Hollywood was after your bucks. Oh, no,

344
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:12,360
German company called Digi Protect claims. The users are breaking copyright law of course they are

345
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,320
and they're demanding out of, out of court settlements, 500 pounds and we won't take you to court.

346
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:24,360
It's just like the RIA. You know what, peeps? This is crazy. You know, we can just go make our own porn.

347
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:29,480
We don't need these guys. It's not going to need German porn. I'm not, you know, fan of porn over here.

348
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,280
Not a big fan of German porn. It's, it's, it's usually German porn. I find to be

349
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
Bushy Harry and

350
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,760
Tom Bushy and Harry.

351
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:46,360
Something like that. Oops, sorry about that. This is what I wanted. Hey, Adam is ship long time.

352
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,640
Caller, um, adder to the drop by O site and all kinds of things like that. I hope you're doing well, my friend.

353
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:59,320
Doing good. Um, kind of interesting thing going on right now is a matter of fact. I'm in a little town called

354
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:08,040
Clinton South Carolina, you know, hotel room here. And I was an interesting conversation I had with some of the people here.

355
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,920
They're having Congress come in to town on a sportsman's retreat.

356
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,800
And from what I've had it's being sponsored by three big oil companies. No kidding.

357
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,520
And so I decided I would go up to the old computer in my room and

358
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:32,760
try to research what that might be. And you know, I've looked everywhere. I possibly can

359
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,560
and can't find any information on it. No, it's course not. So I thought that was kind of

360
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:43,640
interesting don't you think? And it's optimal that. It surprises you. Bye. Doesn't surprise me.

361
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:07,080
I were the disperseist. We climb in what was this. We come in pieces. I said to bigger and so we come to work.

362
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:14,120
The landing coming into my white scrams. Well, it's just the five days. We will like all.

363
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,920
So we move here. Come on. Fresh way home. The signal for the day.

364
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:29,240
We took this time. No man has any right to buy. I'm so near the private guy. My fifth and

365
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:36,280
bow down. That took the land. Now everywhere the world's spring up a day. Come on.

366
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,920
Dying like the loose inside us. Well, the pudgy does last. We never know. Like time

367
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:52,760
into hell. We will not work in the nicer. We've got a green of these. The rich while

368
00:31:52,760 --> 00:32:01,400
poor men stall. We will be together. We need no soaps. We will not bow to the masters

369
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:10,120
up. I went to the lords. We are three men. Now we are poor. Take us all stand up for glory.

370
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,040
We stand up now.

371
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:35,080
From the men of property, the orders kind. They send the hard men and

372
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,680
they begin to push to wipe out. The diggers climb, tear down their cottages. Destroy their

373
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:49,160
corn. They will disperse but still the vision lingers on. You poor tycariate. You rich

374
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:55,240
tycariate. He says, was my little comment, treasure it, for every one to share. All things

375
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:02,520
seem common. All people one, we come in. They steal the order sky to cut them down.

376
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:09,240
Yeah, it's a little bit of a history lesson there on the Chuck for you 809 on a

377
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,520
Fubar Friday afternoon. The world isn't neat upside down even more when you hear

378
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,560
That the French are now

379
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,080
And was funny because we were just talking about this

380
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,440
Johnson de Borgreck was telling me about the truffles he had eaten

381
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,320
I don't know if you have ever had a truffle, but

382
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,560
the French are now essentially planning to clone

383
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:38,840
truffles and create them synthetically of course why not the world is indeed upside down

384
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,840
I can I can hear the window washer

385
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,240
He'll probably stick his head up right in front of my window in a second until it should be kind of weird

386
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,480
A couple more good data points for you from the drop drop.io slash daily source code

387
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,200
the whole Mumbai

388
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,160
slash

389
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,800
Bombay killings are

390
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:03,080
Are baffling to me baffling and there's you know there's information coming out sporadically

391
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,280
I could probably do a whole show just about that in general

392
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,160
Don't tell me my mic is running low is it now okay?

393
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,160
Could do a whole show about all the disinformation or the weird things stuff that just makes no sense

394
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,440
But I will point out as this article from the times does

395
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,960
that the top anti-terrorism officer in Bombay was

396
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:30,760
a specialist in so-called encounter killings which is exactly what this was and he was killed

397
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,480
during this horrible ordeal and I just want to point out that

398
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:42,440
If if you know this really gave me a little interesting perspective on the on the terrorism debate

399
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,080
So this is being called in the you know India's 911. It's terrorist terrorism

400
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:53,320
If there really were terrorists in the United States as an example with all those guns all those hundreds of millions of guns

401
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:59,320
Wouldn't this have happened the long time ago? No because terrorists don't usually want to go out and kill people

402
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,840
governments go out and kill people

403
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,280
Yes, there are some terrorists of course

404
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,280
Of course, but if they really wanted to do it it would have done it

405
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:15,400
Seriously this was this was not hard to do unless you lock down the entire city of Bombay

406
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,960
Which of course is coming next that's what it's all about every single country in increased homeland security

407
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:27,240
Increased border protection controls increased airport security makes me want a puke

408
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,240
If you would like to see

409
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:42,440
Lindsey Williams if you don't know who he is he's the guy who was accurately almost perfectly predicted the price of oil and how the true owners of the earth the energy a

410
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,920
Leat are controlling us and

411
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,600
Controlling the price of oil and are now out to bankrupt the Middle East. There's a great new Google video

412
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,320
Where he predicts the next 12 months. It's a multi-part Google video

413
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,200
There's a lot of background in it that if you've

414
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,640
Never heard of him before you don't have to go hunching around for other stuff because he actually gives you his background

415
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,640
Which is very important and key to his story

416
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,280
landmark case in the European court of human rights

417
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,960
That and this has been all over the news that if the

418
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:20,600
If your DNA is taken this was a British case which was taken to the European human rights court

419
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,160
In fact, this happened with

420
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,920
Two gentlemen from Yorkshire I believe

421
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,520
Their DNA was taken upon arrest. They were then exonerated

422
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,600
Not charged with anything and they took they took this the court is at hey

423
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,640
You know our DNA should be erased from the database if we didn't do anything wrong

424
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,840
And luckily the human rights

425
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,480
Um

426
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,280
The European court of human rights said you're right indeed

427
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,920
But the thing of course that is nuts is that it shouldn't be taken in the first place

428
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
Yes, if well

429
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,720
It'll never get off. It'll never get out of the database or it'll get left on some train or some car seat and

430
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:09,640
It's all a part of the big plan the part of the plan that is to get all of our information control us give us ID cards

431
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,880
Keep us as hat little fucking slaves keep working keep paying your taxes and

432
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,360
Present electobama is just as bad when it comes to that

433
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:26,040
Good article in the show notes about how obama vows US military rule over the planet

434
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,480
Because we're gonna have one million soldiers

435
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,840
Working to secure the homeland

436
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,440
One million soldiers and

437
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:42,920
Already they have five battalions just in case there's any unrest during the credit crisis

438
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:49,160
Which of course is no it's it's beyond a crisis. We are going down the tubes no stopping it the

439
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,800
The bailout now in the United States 8.5 trillion dollars. I'll talk a little bit later on how

440
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,600
There's even discussions that the United Kingdom is going to convert to the euro

441
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,720
It's going to happen and all they're doing now is keeping the shit afloat until obama is

442
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,800
President the minute he's president and he knows it's coming he's part of the plan

443
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:17,000
That's when it ruled that's when the wheels come off this thing. I'm talking global meltdown the minute maybe a minute

444
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Maybe two minutes after he's president you know Joe Biden this said it

445
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:29,240
Someone is scyping me and it's very irritating so between the dog and the Skype it's a complete football

446
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,040
Hey, Kerry you're watching this I haven't heard from you in a while bus

447
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,760
We're moved to the

448
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,320
Cree terrorists is going well

449
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,560
That my loves a lady p

450
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,080
So I was just gonna to the BBC hopefully

451
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,800
You caught this one there talking about a

452
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,480
Transition team for Barack Obama and I think it's talking to one of the

453
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,360
Coffee representatives for

454
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,640
People behind the change dot

455
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:08,680
Website yeah, yeah, yeah, I've you know that this is all coming out of course as a lot of stuff is happening the the bomb bay bombings

456
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,720
The financial crisis and boom boom boom boom all these announcements are being made

457
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:22,360
A lot of people are still staying in the same spots such as our Secretary defense Robert Gates the same guy was been operating under bush

458
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,520
Taking over from Donald Rumsfeld the evil position

459
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:33,240
True Uber warlords there. He'll stay on yeah, and Hillary Clinton a Secretary of State sure

460
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,240
He's got a nice body count attached to her name. They're talking about a

461
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,120
The Barack wanting to improve

462
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,240
You know government transparency

463
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,600
Yeah, and they said something very interesting and might be a topic worth looking into about how

464
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:56,040
You know the text messaging the emails that we sent in real time or by passing the

465
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,040
Filter or quote during the campaign

466
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,200
Yeah, yeah, this is uh, this is a very interesting topic you're bringing up here Russ

467
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,000
I am by the way still receiving email from Barack Obama and

468
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:17,400
Very plough he's the campaign manager. They're both listed on the emails and they're doing parties and get together and

469
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,360
Hold on here it comes

470
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,320
I thought I had the sneeze, but it went away crap. I hate that

471
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,160
Yeah, there's still emailing the propaganda is still flowing

472
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:37,640
This is the direct this is what changed. Gov is also about is about getting the word out directly going around the news filters

473
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,280
Yes, indeed

474
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,640
I wanted to use this in the white house and

475
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:47,000
And this interesting that you know initially I thought it was

476
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,920
Good have the news being that filter and so you know on the one hand

477
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,960
I say well obviously the news I think by and large has failed in that regardless or leave it not being it

478
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,600
Poeton is it can be or should be and

479
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,960
You know so I said on the one hand, you know, I like that there's more direct interplay

480
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,680
That's the same time. I said don't I have to question you know

481
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,920
That just seems like right for a prospect again without some type of analysis

482
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,880
Now when it then you can probably get a whole of this in terror to party you know

483
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,200
It sounds like but you'll act directly in our action

484
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:26,040
And I don't know what do you think Kerry you think this is something that will help with transparency

485
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,040
You think it's just they

486
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,960
Employee to get kind of into people directly without the

487
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:38,040
The interference wasn't so well figure to be a topic to discuss in the DSC so

488
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,800
Great air hope you win love you. I mean it and

489
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,960
They'll work for us one way or the other peace

490
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,760
I'm at Russ. Thank you so much. Yes, very good point

491
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,760
I think there are this has already been implemented. I think it's genius strategy

492
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,320
Of course they're not gonna go around there

493
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:02,520
They're butt buddies from the mass media because that's that's how we elect presidents and that's how we control the pop the populist

494
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,400
But instead of releasing talking points

495
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,000
They're just gonna put it all out in the open like change.gov

496
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,280
You know everything is out there. You know about all this increased security. We're gonna get about the

497
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,000
The soldiers protecting the homeland hint a lot

498
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,440
So there's no culpability, you know, it's like hey, man. We're just gonna put it all out there and then

499
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,200
Because you know the American public

500
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:34,040
Well the world in general doesn't read. Yeah, we'll read the paper and we read about you know the gossip the gossip section

501
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,120
That's all we care about. We read headlines

502
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,800
So they can now spin their own story and

503
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,080
Kind of hand. It's it's basically it's giving the press

504
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,640
Even less work to do

505
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:52,360
So they'll write their own headlines. They put it out big on change.gov. They send it through email and every single new story will be

506
00:42:53,080 --> 00:43:00,680
You know Barack Obama communicated to the American public into the world today that bloody bloody bloody blah instead of people going out doing

507
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:07,640
Investigative work and finding out what they're really up to but in fact, it'll actually be there in the documents

508
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:15,160
It's already unchanged.gov. What is coming? You can see it happening. You can read all about it extra x to read all about it

509
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,120
I should look that up from Tommy the musical

510
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:25,560
No, no, no, this is a brilliant strategy has nothing to do with transparency. It's kind of like that internet thing though

511
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:30,200
Oh, you should be transparent and be able to triangulate and you know if the lies are gonna be there

512
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,360
Doesn't it doesn't have to be a lie

513
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,840
We're so stupid. We just let it all happen

514
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,200
Great article that was left on the drop

515
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,920
It was funny the American people demand to know who sent you

516
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,280
Obama has lived for 48 years without leaving any foot prints none

517
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:53,320
There is no Obama documentation no records no paper trail none. This is no accident

518
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,880
It's being done on purpose with media help but to serve home and why

519
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,760
I'm just pretending I'm not hearing the dog barking in the in the background, okay?

520
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,800
And they go on to say

521
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:12,920
missing or hidden documents on Barack Hussein Obama an original vault copy of certificate of live birth in the USA

522
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,320
has not been released

523
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,560
Certificate of live birth released proved to be counterfeit. That's the one from Hawaii

524
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,640
not released Obama done a marriage license not released

525
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,200
Soutoro done a marriage license. That's

526
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,720
his mother

527
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,760
Adoption records not released

528
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,160
That's so as I guess his mother's adoption records

529
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,400
school

530
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,160
application has been released

531
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,560
Puna who school records not release that's in Hawaii selective service registration

532
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,400
Released proven counterfeit

533
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,600
Occidental college records not released passport Pakistani passport not released

534
00:44:55,080 --> 00:45:00,920
Columbia college records not released Columbia thesis not released Harvard college records not released

535
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,600

537

538
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:16,120
Illinois state Senate schedule are they lost all other Illinois uh they lost

539
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:23,080
His state Senate schedule all other Illinois state senators records are intact law practice client list not released

540
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,280
University of Chicago scholarly articles none

541
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,640
Very interesting and so of course the

542
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,640
The crux of this article is

543
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,560
You know this guy is the mentoring candidate by the way

544
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,080
Was not for John McCain and Sarah Palin either

545
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,720
App to I'm anyone who's gonna

546
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:48,280
In the United States who's going to stand by the Constitution gets my vote it's that simple

547
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,680
That's what was set up that's how the country was set up and when we go and we'll actually I'm gonna

548
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,920
Read you another piece once again from at the end of the show

549
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:01,160
If you deviate from it then you're going against the laws of the land why do you think this thing was set up this way

550
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,320
Democracy republic set up by the French

551
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,280
initially

552
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,360
Who say they need the biggest condoms

553
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,600
I love this

554
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,320
Hold on pop up you're really that

555
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:24,280
I'm sure this was some kind of report some kind of survey the friends say they need the largest condoms in

556
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,120
Europe while the Greeks get by on smaller ones you know according to a

557
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:33,960
Europe-wide study by a German consultancy that provides advice on condoms i.e. the condom industry

558
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:39,000
The snappily named singing based institute of condom consultancy

559
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:44,680
Asked ten and a half thousand men and twenty five countries to measure their penis and enter that number into a database

560
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:50,600
Oh my god if if if the DNA wasn't enough now we've got them put in our penis size in databases

561
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,040
You need an oracle for mine

562
00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:00,040
From those undoubtedly accurate and entirely true responses they found Frenchman on average claim to need

563
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,120
15.48 centimeter long condoms six point oh nine inches

564
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:12,280
About three centimeters longer than the Greeks whose condoms size requirement was the most modest

565
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,520
Amazing

566
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,680
The French have big dicks

567
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,680
Okay, let's hear from your frogs out there we want to know if this is true so you we can put it in our own

568
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:31,400
DSC database the DSC PDD the daily source code penis database got to love it

569
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,600
Hey Adam out from out wrong.com here in Texas

570
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,320
Hey man

571
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,920
Come to weigh in on the true currencies of yours

572
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:48,040
Oh yeah, yeah, this is a GOD gold oil and drugs three true currencies of the universe

573
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:53,400
Which of course is an acronym for God I agree with the GOD but I also have to say

574
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,720
Food

575
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,640
Food is definitely a currency. I'm reminded of the scene of Black Hawk down when

576
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,160
He local warlords are killing people when the

577
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,480
Eight food arrives oh you're so absolutely true

578
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,160
Or right on that it is the truth and there's counterfeit

579
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:17,080
Currency when it comes to food when talk about that in the second counterfeit basically genetically engineered counterfeit

580
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:22,360
Currency if you consider food to be a currency. I think you're right though it will become a currency

581
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:29,640
We know that predictions for next Christmas the best gift you'll be able to give anyone will be food because we're going to get pretty hungry

582
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,880
And that's logical

583
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:37,880
It's logical it's all part of the currency system coming buckling coming to its knees farmers cannot get

584
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,440
Credit or loans for fertilizer

585
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:47,160
Okay, you know what that means we're gonna lose out on the crops. We're gonna lose out on real food and

586
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,880
So obviously food is definitely

587
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:57,760
Currency in that situation been secondly weapons. I think weapons. I can't say I agree with weapons. I'll tell you why in a second

588
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,360
Next one example of a currency specifically like

589
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,760
You know nuclear weapons high technology weapons, but even just you know small arms

590
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:13,160
Definitely to be used as a currency and then finally you know what I disagree because the United States government uses drugs to buy weapons

591
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,840
They this is what's happening. They get the the poppies

592
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,800
You know, they protect the poppy fields and I've got a star and that's what our troops are doing there most of the time

593
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:28,340
Productions up 125% since the Taliban wiped it all out our troops came in. Well, that's up back again

594
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:34,520
They transport the coke in the heroin back to the United States that gets sold the money goes right into Wall Street companies

595
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,320
because they're the only companies that are allowed to take money from

596
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,600
From abroad without

597
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,840
It going through all kinds of complicated systems or scrutiny and

598
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,920
Then the basically by a weapons with that and send it back to cause mayhem and other parts of the world

599
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:56,060
So I would have to say that weapons not a currency drugs

600
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,800
Trump's that one in this case

601
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:03,000
They are radical feminist catalyst the first thing became to mind when this conversation came up was sex

602
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,000
And sex is a

603
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,800
Is of one of the ways that women have been able to use or even maintain any power at all in the current

604
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,440
And wow, that's a that's a big one man. Oh, boy. I

605
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,200
Don't think I disagree with you. It's not a currency

606
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,800
sex is

607
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,800
An necessity of life like oxygen and

608
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,880
Like oxygen in the near future or today already and like water it can be purchased

609
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:37,000
With GOD gold oil or drugs. So I I you know

610
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,720
You I think you're taking it to a very difficult level. I'm too much of a feminist to agree with you on

611
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,360
You know what if he if we were both on the same

612
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,200
You know on the same side on everything the show would be boring. We've got to have and that's the whole point

613
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:14,200
It's not like crossfire, but you know and I kind of enjoyed slowly reeling him in and just the other day

614
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:18,840
I came up with a theory and John said shit you could be right about that so no, no

615
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,760
It's challenge and I like it that way and it's not abuse and and I love him

616
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:27,560
He's the only guy that will listen to my to my ranting consistently without condemning me

617
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:33,560
Or our friendship I should say and also this global warming skepticism that you have is a

618
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,480
Relient retaining and it's good to hear somebody else out there who doesn't buy

619
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,480
That it is absolutely certain that the anthropogenic

620
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,640
CO2 production is

621
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,880
conclusively causally related to global warming. So great here

622
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,920
Yep, thank you best sharing show business

623
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,560
Okay back to the to the food. This is a Yahoo article which you probably want to

624
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,560
probably want to read about

625
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:04,760
Just about what this is here's what I like about this article is called food crunch opens doors to bioengineered crops

626
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:10,120
What I like about it's a very factual article about bioengineered cramps being grown in China

627
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:16,840
Surgeon cost population growth and draw it and other setbacks linked to global climate change and links to all kaita

628
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:24,440
I'll just throw that in myself our pressuring world food supplies while soaring prices on the street of triggered riots and raised the number of people going hungry

629
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,840
To more than 923 million according to UN estimates almost a

630
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,240
A billion people hungry in the world

631
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:42,360
The fuck are you complaining about sitting there listening about some bullshit about your job or whatever

632
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:47,800
You're not hungry yet a billion people going hungry and that's according to the UN

633
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,600
Can't even trust their numbers

634
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,080
With food demand forecast to increase by

635
00:52:53,960 --> 00:53:02,200
Half by 2030 the incentive to use genetic engineering to boost harvest and protect precious crops from insects and other damage has never been greater

636
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,880
But of course we don't actually know what this does to your body

637
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,920
You know the variety of

638
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,480
Vegetables and fruits

639
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,720
That you can eat is diminishing

640
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,000
You know how many different tomatoes tomatoes

641
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:25,240
Can you buy in your supermarket go count them if it's more than four a BMAs but of course there's a hundred different varieties

642
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,800
And it same goes for carrots and for potatoes and you name it

643
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:36,920
No, no, it all has to be brought back. It's all bioengineered and we don't know what this is doing to us

644
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,080
I do know one thing we're not looking much healthier as a populist now. Are we?

645
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:47,640
Thank God for Prince Charles who's coming out against this stuff

646
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,160
He may be the shill after all

647
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:59,400
For the first time the food and drug administration has issued a warning that the mercury contained in silver dental fillings

648
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:06,120
May pose neurological risks to children and pregnant women this the first time that they're actually

649
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,480
Advidding admitting it. It's a neural toxic effect

650
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:17,000
And I'd like to point out that in many of these vaccinations that the government is trying to force on you

651
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,960
Certainly on your children they also use mercury

652
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,800
Mercury is contained in these vaccinations

653
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,800
And it is extremely toxic and it is killing our children go ahead. Do your own research

654
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,960
You'll find out that mercury is very a little tiny trace amounts not a lot needed

655
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,600
But it's being used in vaccination. So let's help them trip over their own stupidity of

656
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,160
Even admitting to this

657
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,080
Mercury is a well-known neurotoxin that can cause cognitive and developmental problems

658
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:53,880
Especially in fetuses and children can also cause brain and kidney damage in adults

659
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:59,480
Crap I have gold. I don't have silver no silver in my mouth

660
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,480
Okay, let's take a little break you see what else is going on in the rest of the world of podcasting

661
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,800
Just clips and what you would have heard if you're releasing the podcast you know member

662
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,440
Before the world wide we have seen some nipple was enchanting

663
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,120
Will our first hand that you better not take that fine little nipple for crayons

664
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,480
Man

665
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,720
Yeah

666
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,080
Yeah, that's the story.

667
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,080
Did you think you're gonna throw the such a junkie in the room?

668
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,080
And yes, the satellite repair minute.

669
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,080
So, it'll be WFETN and the second board.

670
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,080
Hope you like those things.

671
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,080
And please, check out the party cast.

672
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,080
It's roughly 30 minutes of mostly rock and roll,

673
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,080
although as you can tell, we do play.

674
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,080
Quite a bit of other music.

675
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,080
Thank you very much.

676
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,080
I'm proud of you casting with Adam Curry.

677
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,080
This is the hit test.

678
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,080
It hit test number 150.

679
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,080
No, goalless!

680
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,080
Hey Adam, how are you doing?

681
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,080

682
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,080
I'm good man.

683
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,080
I feel like shit and I sound cool.

684
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,080
Sound shit, unfortunately.

685
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,080
It's alright man.

686
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,080
But this is the...

687
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,080
And the first three episode of the hit test, it's number 150,

688
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,080
and it's somewhat special.

689
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,080
So, okay.

690
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,080
We're in trouble.

691
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,080
Number one.

692
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,080
Yeah.

693
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,080
Not too hard for a Dutch guy.

694
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,080
Gold nearing radar love.

695
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,080
Hey man.

696
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,080
Almost three years of this hit test.

697
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,080
Damn, that's a lot.

698
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,080
Number two.

699
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,080
Down, down, down, down, down.

700
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,080
From a health fiction.

701
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,080
That would be...

702
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,080
This is where this Dutch episode,

703
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,080
George Baker's selection and a little green bag.

704
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,080
Oh, I know these are easy.

705
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,080
And the final one is number three.

706
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,080
Yes.

707
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,080
Seven, nine, nine, nine, nine.

708
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,080
Number one.

709
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,080

Marisa ferris, unfortunately passed away.

711
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,080
Another Dutch man.

712
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,080
All Dutch.

713
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,080
It's time for the answers.

714
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:49,080
And this week they're all from Dutch bands with international hits.

715
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,080
Of course.

716
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,080
One hundred fifty.

717
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,080
And this is answered number one.

718
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,080

little green

737
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,080

bad

760
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:12,080
Your answer number two

761
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,080
a

762
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:18,280
This is better than I could see her playing.

763
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,080
This is a lot of beauty and love.

764
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,080
All of her name, maybe.

765
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:28,080
She's got it.

766
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:32,080
Yeah, baby, she's got it.

767
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:36,080
Well, I'm your Venus.

768
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,080
I'm your mind.

769
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,080
You're so desire.

Excellent.

So Adam, yeah, how does she do this week?

774
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,080
Well, I mean, obviously, you're not going to need these right.

775
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:58,080
I wouldn't really been a disgrace to the country of the Netherlands.

776
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,080
Yeah, six out of six.

777
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:03,080
Got all the titles in the band's right on episode 150.

778
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,080
Yeah, Ancestry Edition, any other hit list.

779
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,080
And also the iTunes link so you can buy the tricks.

780
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,080
Featured on the hit list online.

781
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:12,080
Or to be found at hittest.mifio.com.

782
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:18,080
For the 150th time, thanks for playing Adam.

783
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,080
Thank you, young.

784
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,080
Everyone else, thanks for listening.

785
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,080
Next week I'll be back for another hit list.

786
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,080
And I'll be feeling better as well.

787
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,080
We hope so as well.

788
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,080
So until then, have fun, take care.

789
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,080
And remember to try to think with your heart.

790
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,080
Bye-bye.

791
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,080
Well, he did a show.

792
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,080
Congratulations, young.

793
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,080
Fantastic.

794
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,080
Once a week, 150 episodes.

795
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,080
Hittest.mifio.com.

796
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,080
You got iTunes links.

797
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,080
You can go purchase the songs.

798
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,080
It's a good deal.

799
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,080
Or, of course, you would go to emusic.com.

800
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,080
Slash DSC.

801
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,080
And you can get 35 songs for free.

802
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,080
By the way, there's a whole bunch.

803
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,080
And you guys are using it.

804
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,080
BrooksDon.com.

805
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,080
We've got eHarmony.

806
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,080
Where you.

807
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,080
Um, I like this.

808
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,080
This is very successful for us.

809
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,080
eHarmony.com.

810
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,080
And you can go to dailysourcecode.com or create.com.

811
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,080
It's crossposted there in the show.

812
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:20,080
No, as you can find all my codes and direct links to getting these great discounts.

813
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:24,080
So BrooksDon, of course, is kind of like the sharper image for outdoorsy stuff selling

814
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,080
a shitload of stuff there.

815
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:30,080
And, of course, it's normal because we're all looking for a good deal these days with,

816
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,080
you know, we're watching what we're spending.

817
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:36,080
So, you know, it's not like we're not buying at all, but we're doing it to

818
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,080
actually the go daddy domain names.

819
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,080
Of course, dirt cheap can get it cheaper.

820
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,080
All these deals.

821
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,080
Budget rent to car.

822
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,080
But eHarmony is three months free.

823
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,080
And that's a really good deal.

824
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,080
And we're signing up people left and right.

825
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,080
A lot of lonely people out there.

826
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,080
And if you used my, my code for eHarmony.

827
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,080
And you found a mate.

828
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,080
Or if you found no success.

829
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,080
I'd love to hear from you.

830
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:04,080
In fact, on anything you purchase through the DSC codes,

831
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,080
let me know how went for you.

832
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,080
Dog is still barking.

833
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,080
Fuckers 15 years old.

834
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,080
You're going to bark yourself to death.

835
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,080
And it's just because of the window washer.

836
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:18,080
I guess didn't pop up on the third floor, which is too bad because that means he

837
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:23,080
also doesn't get his check.

838
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:26,080
From salon.com.

839
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:30,080
Interesting little thing, a little history lesson on the history of,

840
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:35,080
actually it's called a brief history of the criminalization of cannabis.

841
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,080
I'm sure you've heard of the movie.

842
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:40,080
Refer Madness, which gives you some of this history.

843
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:44,080
But this goes back to 7,000 BC.

844
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:47,080
And takes you through the 1700s, the 1800s.

845
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:51,080
A lot revolving around cannabis and hemp in the 1900s.

846
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,080
The Mexican connection.

847
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,080
Jazz, alcohol prohibition.

848
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,080
Journalism, newspapers.

849
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:03,080
And of course, all the way to that was even a marijuana tax in 1937 that was proposed.

850
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:07,080
It's a great, great page to have a look at.

851
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,080
And you should ask yourself.

852
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,080
You should ask yourself.

853
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,080
Why is it illegal?

854
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:20,080
Some that I'm surely going to use on under my gear show.

855
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,080
When it comes out, it's not until mid 2009.

856
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,080
Have you seen the Nokia N97?

857
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,080
Hello, boner time.

858
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,080
I mean, I love the E71 that I've been using.

859
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,080
I mean, I really love it to death.

860
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,080
You know what?

861
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,080
I get a hand people this phone.

862
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,080
I gave it to AL.

863
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,080
He's our, our CTO.

864
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,080
I handed it to him the other day.

865
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,080
So I wanted to show him something.

866
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,080
And he had it in his hand.

867
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,080
And he said, crap.

868
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,080
What kind of phone is this?

869
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,080
Because when you hold this thing,

870
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,080
the works are the same thing.

871
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,080
It just feels good.

872
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,080
You know, and that's, that's the one thing.

873
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,080
The Apple iPhone never felt good.

874
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,080
It felt like you got to hold it a certain way.

875
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,080
Because otherwise you'll touch the screen.

876
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:00,080
Just didn't feel ever really feel perfect.

877
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:04,080
But the E71 is outstanding in the hand.

878
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:07,080
If it's well in my hand.

879
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:12,080
But this E, this N76 essentially is kind of a hybrid.

880
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:17,080
It's like the E71 had sex with the N810 and came up with a

881
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:23,080
Symbian based keyboard slide out pop-up screen computer on the go.

882
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,080
With a phone built into it.

883
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,080
Very excited about that.

884
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:31,080
And I am definitely going to beg the candy man to get me an Evel device.

885
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,080
I'll send it back.

886
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,080
I'll buy my own.

887
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,080
I just want to be the first one of my block to have one.

888
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,080
This seems like it is the perfect device for me.

889
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:41,080
Even though I'm so happy with the E71 so far.

890
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,080
And of course, Nokia knows their phone shit.

891
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,080
So you know that all the other stuff is going to work.

892
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,080
Now let's see how they do on the multimedia computing.

893
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:51,080
It'll do flash, by the way, as well.

894
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,080
The specs are just amazing.

895
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,080
All right.

896
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,080
So let's talk about money for a couple of minutes here.

897
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:58,080
As we round out the show.

898
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,080
Like it or not, right CNN.

899
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:03,080
There's only one way we're going to be able to pay for our

900
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,080
ballooning deficit.

901
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,080
Now $8.5 trillion added to that.

902
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:09,080
Thanks to the bailout.

903
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,080
It's a value added tax.

904
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,080
This is in place in many countries around the world.

905
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:17,080
It's in place in the United Kingdom in most of Europe.

906
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,080
Essentially, it's a sales tax on top of everything.

907
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,080
And by the way, prostitutes will have to charge it as well.

908
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,080
Which is fine by me.

909
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:30,080
Because if it's a business expense, you can deduct the VAT.

910
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,080
I'll make it a business expense.

911
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:35,080
I need to de-stress before the show.

912
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:38,080
A lady Patricia approved, obviously.

913
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,080
Otherwise nothing will happen.

914
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,080
Highly possible, if not inevitable,

915
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:45,080
that Americans will soon live under a radically different tax system.

916
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:48,080
One that the pundits and politicians aren't talking about.

917
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:51,080
It's called the value added tax or VAT.

918
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,080
I'm pretending not to hear the dog.

919
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:57,080
A very good point.

920
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:00,080
Boy, you know that thing is like 17%

921
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,080
19% in the Netherlands.

922
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:06,080
21% value added tax in Belgium.

923
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,080
Yeah.

924
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,080
We're going to pay for it.

925
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,080
That money has to be paid for.

926
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,080
It's going to be us.

927
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,080
We're going down the tubes while it takes place.

928
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:17,080
Interestingly enough, this is not happening.

929
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:21,080
These bailouts or not happening in the same fashion in Italy.

930
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:27,080
Checking in from the hills of Florence is my sister Willow with a little bit on Italian bailouts.

931
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:31,080
The lack thereof on the banks or perhaps a lot of them when it comes to airline industries.

932
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,080
Willow, come on in.

933
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,080
How are you doing?

934
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,080
Hello, it's your sister checking in.

935
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:39,080
May I say, by the way, Willow, you're disgraced to the family.

936
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,080
Listen to this audio quality.

937
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,080
This sucks.

938
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,080
You're going to have a lot of complaints, Italy.

939
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,080
And I'm checking in with regards to the bailouts.

940
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:53,080
Because I thought it was interesting to point out that in Italy, not one single bank has been bailed out.

941
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:58,080
Or actually has had the need to be bailed out as far as I know.

942
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,080
And there was something going on with it when it created so.

943
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:04,080
But as far as I know, no banks have been bailed out.

944
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:09,080
And I have my own theory of why there is no need.

945
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:12,080
Definitely the Italian government is all linked to bailouts.

946
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,080
Just think of Italian.

947
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,080
Yeah.

948
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,080
They bail out industry all the time.

949
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,080
Even carbon companies.

950
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:21,080
And they bail out fiat I think or alpha or whatever.

951
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,080
Most disastrous bailout.

952
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:29,080
Anyway, my own theory is that it has never been easy in Italy to get a mortgage.

953
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,080
And they never got into the mortgage hype.

954
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:37,080
Up until five years ago, it was almost impossible to get 100% value mortgage.

955
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:41,080
Which by the way, is a huge mistake.

956
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,080
A hundred percent of mortgage.

957
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:46,080
I'm a total believer in down payments.

958
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,080
It should never be a hundred percent.

959
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:51,080
You need that wiggle room for precisely what just happened,

960
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,080
minimum ten percent.

961
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,080
Some countries.

962
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:57,080
Some banks require minimum of twenty percent down payment.

963
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:00,080
So I think that's probably a very good thing that that didn't happen.

964
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:04,080
Three years ago, I couldn't get a three year mortgage.

965
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,080
Everything was twenty or fifteen years.

966
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,080
So they never got into the mortgage hype.

967
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:14,080
Not into renegotiating mortgages as I know out of experience.

968
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,080
Yeah.

969
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,080
Yeah.

970
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,080
I gave you some advice on this.

971
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:23,080
But the banks no longer can actually negotiate your mortgage.

972
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:26,080
I mean, used to be, you get your mortgage from your local bank.

973
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,080
You run into, you lose your job, you run into some other problems.

974
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,080
You go to the bank managers.

975
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,080
I did.

976
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,080
I gave my situation.

977
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,080
Here's what I can do.

978
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,080
You know, here's, you can talk to my boss.

979
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,080
You know, where am I going?

980
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,080
New job.

981
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,080
You can, you can book banks.

982
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,080
They want to work with you.

983
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:45,080
But what happened is they took these mortgages, chopped them up into millions of pieces

984
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:49,080
and sold them off as assets.

985
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,080
And we're added to balance sheets worldwide.

986
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,080
This is, you know what?

987
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,080
I'm going to turn the noise gate on.

988
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,080
Then I just won't hear him anymore.

989
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:00,080
That's going to help.

990
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,080
Now, I don't hear him anymore.

991
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:08,080
So, you know, so there's no one to go talk to because your mortgage was split up into thousands

992
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,080
of little pieces.

993
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,080
That's why there was no one to go to.

994
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,080
No one to talk to when you want to renegotiate your mortgage.

995
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,080
A big part of the whole problem.

996
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,080
Not our mistake, of course.

997
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,080
Not easy to get done here.

998
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:25,080
So that just means that the, and I know that I was parents and actually

999
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:29,080
turns out that the most solid bank in Italy is my very own bank.

1000
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:34,080
The claim to go pretty real, who denied my renegotiation.

1001
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:38,080
So anyway, I just thought that was interesting.

1002
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:42,080
And another thing is that Berlusconi, with all his faults,

1003
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:47,080
that he has, I thought was interesting that he,

1004
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:52,080
doesn't, isn't bailing out banks or the CEOs or whatever,

1005
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:56,080
but he's bailing out the little people, which.

1006
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,080
Okay.

1007
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,080
Oh boy, okay, sis.

1008
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,080
I'm ready for it.

1009
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,080
He's bailing out it.

1010
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,080
So you're going to tell me that Sylvia Berlusconi,

1011
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:09,080
who owns all the media and is the El Presidente,

1012
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,080
that he is a good guy.

1013
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,080
And he's thinking about the little people.

1014
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,080
Look, I know, no matter what.

1015
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,080
Sorry.

1016
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,080
I said, look there.

1017
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,080
I hate doing that.

1018
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,080
Please.

1019
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:21,080
He does not love you.

1020
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,080
Let's hear.

1021
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:25,080
Let's hear what this savior is doing for Italy.

1022
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:29,080
I even be a good idea either, but I definitely, you know,

1023
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,080
using his bailouts.

1024
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,080
And one was already six or seven months ago.

1025
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:36,080
He passed the degree, ministerial degree,

1026
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:41,080
where banks were obliged to sort of

1027
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:44,080
renegotiations spreadsheet scheme.

1028
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,080
I'll call it.

1029
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,080
The user words were the spreadsheet,

1030
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,080
where you pay less.

1031
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,080
You go back to the interest rate.

1032
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,080
They had in 2006.

1033
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,080
And then the monthly payments are at that.

1034
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:58,080
The interest rate for until the mortgage is ended.

1035
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,080
And then at the end of the mortgage,

1036
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:03,080
they see what you actually had to pay in or in.

1037
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,080
Yeah, that's called a balloon payment.

1038
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,080
Okay.

1039
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,080
This is happening, Europe.

1040
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,080
Why?

1041
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,080
This is not just a good old Sylvia there.

1042
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,080
Gordon Brown announced this just yesterday.

1043
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,080
One billion pound bailout package for the little people.

1044
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,080
For the wee people.

1045
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,080
As our mom would say,

1046
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,080
it's bullshit.

1047
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,080
Yeah.

1048
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,080
So what they're doing is they're going to.

1049
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:26,080
So everyone got popped through these adjustable rate mortgages,

1050
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,080
which, of course, tripled your mortgage payment almost overnight.

1051
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:33,080
And, you know, it was like a three year or five year arm.

1052
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:37,080
Adjustable rate mortgages would arm stands for.

1053
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,080
But what they're doing is just delaying the inevitable.

1054
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:42,080
So at the end of your term, which will be in two years from now,

1055
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,080
then you get sucked.

1056
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,080
When you absolutely can't use it.

1057
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:48,080
When you're completely ready to sell your soul,

1058
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,080
that's when they're going to come in and throw you out on the street.

1059
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:54,080
I think the economy's getting better in two years time.

1060
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,080
You're wrong.

1061
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,080
It's going to, with the way that they're interfering,

1062
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,080
it's going to take 10 years.

1063
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,080
We'll have a 10 year downturn.

1064
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,080
It's going to be horrific.

1065
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,080
So all they're doing, again, is just keeping all the shit afloat,

1066
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:09,080
get Moroccan and Barack is going to be the one to communicate directly to you

1067
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,080
through change.gov.

1068
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,080
How you're all getting fucked.

1069
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,080
More than, you know,

1070
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,080
when you pay the new,

1071
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,080
you'll keep on paying.

1072
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,080
And if it's worth me,

1073
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,080
actually your mortgage finance is earlier.

1074
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,080
It's a whole complicated scheme.

1075
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,080
But it's not complicated.

1076
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,080
They're just deferring it.

1077
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,080
And they make it look complicated.

1078
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,080
So you don't understand it,

1079
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,080
but all you know is you don't have to pay,

1080
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,080
you can start paying less than they want from you.

1081
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,080
For now,

1082
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,080
but they're going to hit you at the end,

1083
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,080
and it will come as a crushing blow,

1084
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:42,080
because there's no way anyone can make up for it in 24 months

1085
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,080
time.

1086
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,080
There's just no way.

1087
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,080
It's going to be a huge balloon payment.

1088
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,080
And that, that,

1089
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,080
my fellow chuckleheads is when you really get shocked.

1090
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,080
We did apply for that,

1091
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:54,080
which will bring our mortgage payments,

1092
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,080
you know,

1093
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,080
we'll reduce them by 300 euros a month,

1094
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,080
which I think is a lot of money.

1095
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,080
So that's a scheme that he passed.

1096
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,080
All right,

1097
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:06,080
let me just bring up the calculator here.

1098
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,080
Okay,

1099
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:12,080
so we're talking 300 times 24

1100
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,080
is 30,000.

1101
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,080
Wait, and that,

1102
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,080
and do that right.

1103
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,080
300.

1104
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,080
I did it wrong.

1105
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,080
I was 24.

1106
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,080
7200.

1107
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:25,080
So in two years time,

1108
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,080
Ed minimum,

1109
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,080
but they're going to charge you interest on top of that.

1110
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,080
You'll probably look at a 10,000 euro nut.

1111
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,080
You're going to have to satisfy

1112
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,080
or they'll kick you out of your house.

1113
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,080
I don't want to sound like a downer here,

1114
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,080
but this is just delaying the inevitable.

1115
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,080
It's a temporary bailout.

1116
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,080
It's like giving you a credit card for your house.

1117
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,080
Because there's any way you can pay more,

1118
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,080
do it.

1119
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,080
That's my recommendation.

1120
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,080
Or pay nothing,

1121
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,080
which is what a lot of people are going to wind up doing.

1122
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,080
Pay nothing,

1123
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,080
and just let the bank fail.

1124
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,080
And then you'll probably have a couple of years

1125
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,080
until they're already changing all these laws.

1126
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:00,080
Now,

1127
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,080
if you're a six months behind on your,

1128
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,080
on your payments,

1129
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,080
they won't kick you out.

1130
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,080
They want to move that.

1131
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,080
It's all coming in two years.

1132
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,080
You guys want us going to happen.

1133
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,080
2011.

1134
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,080
Ooh, gee.

1135
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,080
Conveniently moving in in 2012,

1136
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,080
that's when everyone's going to get hit.

1137
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,080
So, yeah, short term.

1138
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,080
It sounds good.

1139
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,080
It sounds like silly,

1140
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,080
oh, your buddy,

1141
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,080
but he's not.

1142
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,080
He does not love you.

1143
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,080
And although interesting,

1144
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,080
I'm not only 30,

1145
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,080
I read today in the newspaper.

1146
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,080
Only 30,000 families have used this,

1147
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:33,080
this spreadsheet scheme for a good negotiation.

1148
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:36,080
But what they said today,

1149
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,080
because they,

1150
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,080
I don't know if it's already past

1151
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,080
or whatever,

1152
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,080
but they're having the crisis package,

1153
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,080
the package deal.

1154
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,080
Yeah, crisis package.

1155
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,080
This is the stimulus package.

1156
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:50,080
I haven't even heard this comment from Willa yet,

1157
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,080
but I'm going to guess it has to do with spending money

1158
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,080
for you to spend somewhere.

1159
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,080
So, we can continue to keep lending going

1160
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,080
and continue to have the system working

1161
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:03,080
where we enslave to the energy elite with debt.

1162
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,080
And in the crisis package,

1163
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,080
which I thought was very funny,

1164
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,080
among other things like,

1165
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,080
they have the social cards for people

1166
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,080
with a certain income.

1167
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,080
Yep, social cards,

1168
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,080
which means you're registered in the database.

1169
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,080
They know who you are.

1170
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,080
They know where you are.

1171
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,080
They've got your biometric data.

1172
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,080
Of course, a national ID database.

1173
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,080
That's a great way to get people to sign up.

1174
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:29,080
They'll be the first to be put in the camps.

1175
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,080
They'll be the first to be put in the camps.

1176
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,080
The wee people.

1177
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:38,080
And also that for the year 2009,

1178
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,080
anybody with a mortgage,

1179
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,080
with an adjustable rate,

1180
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:48,080
will not have to pay more than 4% interest.

1181
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,080
That's without the spread.

1182
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,080
I mean, for it is just a pure interest,

1183
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,080
not with the spread point to whatever in it.

1184
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,080
And anything that is above the 4%

1185
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:00,080
the Italian government will pay.

1186
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,080
And let me just think,

1187
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,080
who is the Italian government?

1188
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,080
It's,

1189
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:08,080
where do they get their money from?

1190
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,080
Oh yeah!

1191
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,080
They get it from you,

1192
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,080
willow.

1193
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,080
So they're going to have to pay for that.

1194
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:18,080
The only way to do that is through taxation.

1195
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:21,080
And if they don't do it through taxation,

1196
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,080
they'll print the money,

1197
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,080
which means you get inflation,

1198
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,080
which means prices go up,

1199
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,080
which is a hidden tax,

1200
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,080
which means you're paying for it anyway.

1201
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,080
It's a trick.

1202
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,080
It's a shell game.

1203
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,080
It's just moving money from one place to the other,

1204
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,080
but it's your money.

1205
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:40,080
You are now paying for the people who can't pay for their mortgages.

1206
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,080
People who are paying for their mortgages,

1207
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,080
now will be paying for people who can't pay for their mortgages.

1208
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,080
That's what it is.

1209
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,080
It's called socialism,

1210
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,080
throwing a little bit of fascism.

1211
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,080
That goes very well with Sylvia.

1212
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,080
So say that right now,

1213
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,080
I'm paying 6%

1214
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,080
and but the actual interest rate

1215
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,080
was probably at 5% you have a 1% spread.

1216
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:02,080
Then the 1% that I don't pay,

1217
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,080
the time government will pay.

1218
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,080
You will pay for it.

1219
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,080
Not the government.

1220
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,080
The government is not a company that has,

1221
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,080
it's you are the government.

1222
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,080
You're paying for it.

1223
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,080
You don't think that it,

1224
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,080
because it's not coming directly out of your pocket.

1225
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,080
You're not sending it directly to the bank.

1226
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,080
It will come out of your pocket

1227
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,080
through taxes.

1228
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,080
They're going to have to pay.

1229
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,080
This is what America doesn't understand.

1230
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,080
Fucking boneheads.

1231
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,080
Eight and a half trillion dollars.

1232
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,080
Someone has to pay for this.

1233
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,080
That's why it's going to probably be a value out of tax

1234
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,080
and a whole new funding system.

1235
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:38,080
For this whole year of 2009.

1236
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:42,080
So I thought that was a very interesting bailout.

1237
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,080
But what you like even more

1238
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,080
is who is paying for this.

1239
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,080
Actually, you're a dishonor radio

1240
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,080
right before coming home.

1241
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,080
So I haven't verified it.

1242
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,080
I haven't Google it yet.

1243
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:57,080
But what they said on the radio and the news

1244
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:00,080
was that there will be the porn industry

1245
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,080
who will be paying for this.

1246
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,080
Okay, wait a minute.

1247
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,080
No, we were now interested.

1248
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,080
The porn industry.

1249
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,080
Okay.

1250
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:10,080
Let me hear how the porn industry

1251
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,080
is going to pay for your mortgage.

1252
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,080
Because the raising,

1253
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:17,080
I'm not sure what tax by 25%

1254
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,080
on the porn industry.

1255
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,080
There you go.

1256
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,080
There you go.

1257
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,080
I risked my case.

1258
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:26,080
That's like taxing beer 25%.

1259
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,080
The porn industry is not humongous for no reason.

1260
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,080
Hey.

1261
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,080
Tell me how a sondo doesn't have an account somewhere

1262
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,080
on some porn site.

1263
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,080
Tell me he doesn't.

1264
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,080
He's going to be paying for it

1265
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,080
through his porn consumption.

1266
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,080
Well, I don't know.

1267
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,080
You might even have a porn.

1268
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,080
I got a couple porn accounts.

1269
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,080
I'm not ashamed to say it.

1270
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,080
There you go.

1271
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,080
Now it's finally out.

1272
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,080
The porn industry.

1273
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,080
You know what?

1274
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,080
Porn is going to save us.

1275
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,080
In fact, this is a very good idea.

1276
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:58,080
I think the porn industry should stand up and say,

1277
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,080
yes, we'll be happy to bill you out.

1278
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,080
Because you know why?

1279
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,080
Get rid of all the stupid restrictions.

1280
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,080
Stop the idiotic filtering.

1281
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,080
Let the people have their porn.

1282
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:10,080
Let the people have their porn.

1283
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,080
I'm happy to pay 25% extra.

1284
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,080
If that'll keep you at housed.

1285
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,080
Absolutely.

1286
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,080
Porn is like oxygen.

1287
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,080
Sex is like water.

1288
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,080
It's necessary.

1289
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,080
Give the people their porn.

1290
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,080
Tax them to high hell.

1291
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,080
That's fine.

1292
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,080
But just remember, at the end of the day,

1293
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,080
it's the people paying for it.

1294
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,080
Not the government.

1295
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,080
So anyway,

1296
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:38,080
that was just my update from the bailouts in Italy.

1297
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:41,080
And then that's it.

1298
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,080
Yeah.

1299
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,080
Nice day.

1300
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,080
Alright, Willa.

1301
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,080
Thank you very much.

1302
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,080
Love you.

1303
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,080
See you down, my friends.

1304
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,080
Thank God the porn industry is there

1305
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:52,080
to stop us from the free fall.

1306
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,080
She's a good girl.

1307
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,080
Love's in my heart.

1308
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:00,080
Love's Jesus.

1309
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,080
In America too.

1310
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:06,080
She's a good girl.

1311
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:09,080
It's crazy about elves.

1312
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,080
Love's for us.

1313
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:14,080
In her boyfriend too.

1314
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:19,080
It's a long day.

1315
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,080
Give the people your seat on.

1316
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:24,080
There's a free way.

1317
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,080
Run through the arm.

1318
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,080
And I'm a bad boy.

1319
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:32,080
So don't you miss him.

1320
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,080
I'm a bad boy.

1321
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:37,080
To break in her heart.

1322
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,080
I'm a bad boy.

1323
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:42,080
To break in her heart.

1324
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:48,080
I'm free.

1325
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:54,080
Free for this.

1326
01:20:54,080 --> 01:21:00,080
Free.

1327
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:06,080
Free for this.

1328
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:11,580
All of them are walking through the valley

1329
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:17,080
Move west down, venture over the wall

1330
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:23,080
All of them are standing in the shadow

1331
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:28,080
In the good girl, they're home and broken the halls

1332
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,080
Are free!

1333
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:39,080

Revoluvel!

1336
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,080
You're free!

1337
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:03,080
For free, all in power, free, all in power

1338
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:14,080
Free, all in power, free, all in power

1339
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:19,080
I wanna glad to have you, all in power

I'm even scared, gotta free, all in power

1342
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:35,080

1343
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:42,080
Now I'm free, all in power, free, all in power

1344
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:48,080
All in power, all in power, free, all in power

1345
01:22:48,080 --> 01:23:18,080
We're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling

1346
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:48,080
We're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling we're falling, we're falling, we're falling, we're falling

1347
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:52,920
complicated. So you could do that for me, but I highly appreciate it. I want to

1348
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:58,600
half end of the show. And nearing the end, but I just really want to get this

1349
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:03,880
whole financial crisis straight in your head. So you know that, you know, you've been

1350
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:08,800
bombarded with this on a daily basis. Oh, hold on a second. What's this text

1351
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:16,560
message from my lovely wife? What does she say? Okay. Someone wants to talk to me. I

1352
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:22,800
don't care. Now, right now, I'm talking to the chuckleheads. Peter Schiff, who has

1353
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:27,440
been on CNBC, he's been laughed out in the past, but he is called everything pretty

1354
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,000
much that's taking place on the money. It's the same things we're saying here,

1355
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,960
same thing I've been talking about for the past year. But very interestingly, when he was

1356
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,640
on CNN during this interview, he really laid into what's the name Becky, I think.

1357
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:45,960
Well, one man he's been keeping a close line of the government. Sorry. And he gets

1358
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:49,920
cut off at the end. They literally pull the plug on the sidelight and old Fox news

1359
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,040
trick. Listen to what he has to say, though. And this is on an update on the Dow.

1360
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:58,480
Let me see what's it up load at the 24th of November or the Dow is up. I can see on

1361
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:03,880
screen, 335 points. Listen to him break it down very simply. Listen to Becky

1362
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:07,680
try to interrupt. You're really frustrated. He keeps going. And then they just

1363
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:12,000
disconnect him. They pull the frickin' plug. Now, to plans, all of them, they

1364
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,960
is a piece of chef, he's the president of Europe, Pacific, capitalists, a global

1365
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:21,960
investment strategy company and the author of the little book of bull moves in bear markets

1366
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,960
or to be a good reathie. So, if you want to be now, like, let's talk about city group

1367
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:29,760
given that we've just been hearing from Alan on that. You know, they make the decision

1368
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,160
about the bailing city group out. They say it's to important to fail. They don't say

1369
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:37,160
that about laymen. They're considering what they're doing with the auto companies that

1370
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:41,280
the moment they haven't made a decision about that. We think of these decisions at this

1371
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:45,840
point. Well, the only good decision they made was letting Lehman Brothers fail. And somehow

1372
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,320
they think, that's the source of our problems. What about all the companies that they did

1373
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:53,600
bail out? You know, we're in this mess for a reason. It's because of government spending

1374
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,680
because too much debt. And these bailouts simply, you know, we're accumulating more debt.

1375
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:05,040
And the government is broke. You got a Brock now talking about $700 billion a stimulus plan.

1376
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:09,520
Maybe a trillion dollars. We don't have any money. You know, we need the world to lend

1377
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:14,320
us this money. We need the Chinese. We need the Japanese to lend us money that we can't pay

1378
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:17,600
back because no, we're going to do with the money. We're going to spend it. And then what

1379
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,880
is gone, we're going to be begging for more.

1380
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:24,560
Yeah. Let's talk about this stimulus package because this big and it's getting bigger by

1381
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:31,560
the day. And Brock Obama's put this group of, it called an e-grip together as it were.

1382
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:35,120
We're beginning to learn the names of those. Are they the right men and women to the job

1383
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:39,520
at this point? Look, if they think the economy is more stimulus, they don't, they shouldn't

1384
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,880
be in these jobs. You know, we should, we don't even need any economic advisors. We should

1385
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,120
abolish them all. I mean, look at this mess. We're in the, they're giving bad advice. We don't

1386
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:52,640
know, this is so true. This is exactly what it's all about. You have to let the shit go.

1387
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:57,680
The system has to come apart. What, what is happening now with all this money being printed

1388
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,960
up? Which we can't borrow because the Chinese are going to borrow. They're going to lend

1389
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,640
us shit anymore. You kidding me? They've already had to write off billions and billions.

1390
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:09,840
No way. I'm nuts. They're not going to throw their good money after bad. The dollar is going

1391
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:16,480
to come crashing down. It's being held afloat. This is all to get ready for President Obama

1392
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:21,680
because he's going to be the Messiah, the Savior. He's going to make us feel good. But we're

1393
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:27,200
getting raped. And the fucking has all, I'm sorry to put it that way. It's already started.

1394
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:31,440
These stimulus. We don't need American spending more money. That's how we got into this mess.

1395
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:35,760
We borrow money and we spend it. Now we can't pay it back. Americans need to make things.

1396
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:40,240
Then you do go to work and then just save their money. We can't try to stimulate the economy

1397
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,240
through more spending. And we can't do anything.

1398
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:46,560
You're using the economy by more spending overnight effectively because you don't make anything

1399
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:52,720
anymore. That's the problem. That can't change. Can it? Yeah, yeah. A lot of countries don't make

1400
01:27:52,720 --> 01:28:00,240
stuff anymore. That is indeed a huge problem. Oh, Lordy, Lordy, how I yearn for alternative

1401
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:04,960
energy that really works and is propagated. Something you can just rub your hands together

1402
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:10,320
and make something, make some spark or fire. Is it the ore going around us? It's something

1403
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:15,760
is there. We're going to find it. We got to continue. Continue finding alternative energy beyond

1404
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:20,640
wind and solar. Can change. That's a long term plan. Yes, but it has to change. And the government

1405
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:25,440
has to let it change. The government has to get out of the way and let our phony economy collapse.

1406
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:29,920
I know it's going to be painful. But it's necessary. We can't keep pretending. We have a

1407
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:35,120
viable economy and expecting to rest the world to finance it. You know, we have to actually

1408
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:39,280
make things. We need a real industrial revolution in this country. We don't need more economic

1409
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:43,360
stimulus. That's more of the problem. And we can't keep rewarding people. Look at the city

1410
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:48,320
core bank bailout. I mean, look how much money these executives at these companies make.

1411
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:52,640
How can we let these guys pay themselves millions of dollars when the companies are broke?

1412
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:56,400
I'm not going to make any money over there for years. So the government's going to keep giving

1413
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:01,600
them more and more money so they can lavish it out on the executives. And now we're probably

1414
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,760
going to have to bail out general motors because we bailed out city. You know, general motors

1415
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,640
needs to fail. But now we've got to support the overpaid union workers. I ended right because

1416
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:14,640
we're over with the support. He's trying to interrupt. She's like, she's because, you know,

1417
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:18,800
she's got an IFB, right? They're telling her, tell them to shut up, get them off the air already.

1418
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:23,840
Because this is on the day that Obama called for an ambitious stimulus plan. See an end being the

1419
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:28,400
Obama station of the nation. They're trying to stop him. Like, she's trying to interrupt him.

1420
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:32,720
We got to get this guy. Stop, stop, stop. He's making Obama. Our man. Look bad.

1421
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:39,280
See you later. You let city bank fail with you today. Of course. I don't let AIG fail.

1422
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:43,520
I don't let bear. There'd be a lot of firms that would be failing if the government had stepped

1423
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:48,560
out of the way. But capitalism isn't about cropping up failed companies. We need to let them fail.

1424
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:53,200
There's reason that these companies are going broke. We don't want to prop them up. Now, of course,

1425
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:58,080
behind it all is the Federal Reserve. If the Federal Reserve had never intervened in the market

1426
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:06,000
back in 2001 and 2002, had they not poured all this out? Note those dates 2001, 2002,

1427
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:12,560
no George Bush came to power in 2000, 911 2001. Does it sound like a plan was being executed here?

1428
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:19,440
I'm really starting to believe it. I'm starting to really think that conspiracy is for real.

1429
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:24,960
And he's getting out. He said it all up. He's teed it up and Obama's going to make us feel good.

1430
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,000
Well, he get the flaming hot poker up the rectum.

1431
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,960
Fall and Wall Street wouldn't have gotten drunk. But they did. They made a lot of bad decisions.

1432
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:37,920
Which is, by the way, just so you just to set it straight, just exactly why Sarah Pailman was on the

1433
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,400
Republican ticket. Because she would have met, they thought, it's a hedge, right? You know,

1434
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,000
she could have made America feel good. I think a lot of people believe in her.

1435
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:54,000
And would buy her. She's great actress. Obama's a fantastic actor, you know, but she is just a great great great

1436
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,920
actress and mill fee. And now we've got to suffer the consequences. But it's not fair to try to say that the whole

1437
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:05,200
country that everybody around the world who's holding US dollars has to pay because of the bad

1438
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:11,360
best made on Wall Street. Here it comes. All right. So given what you're saying, you say,

1439
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:16,000
government get out of the way, uh, the invisible hand of the free markets work this time,

1440
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,680
you be staring down the barrel of awfully difficult times for a very long time for many,

1441
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:25,520
many Americans at this point. So you know, yeah, she's getting fed that you can see that this

1442
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:30,080
information is coming into her ear. And she's basically saying, you schmuck, you shit,

1443
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:35,120
are you nuts? You want to kill people? And he's about to say, oh, man, if we let it go,

1444
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:39,680
this way, the government's going to kill many more. No, no question about that. But it's, it's

1445
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:44,240
false to assume that the government can do anything about that. I am convinced that every thing

1446
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:52,240
the government is doing to fight this off is going to make, uh, gone, bars. And I'm afraid we've lost,

1447
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:56,960
uh, I'll guess that I'm sorry about that technical problems. But, uh, we heard, um,

1448
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:01,040
his thoughts, uh, interesting ones, Peter Schiff, they're the president of Europe, Pacific,

1449
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:07,600
capital, these things happen right. Well, news of, oh, man, 10 Downing Street, the British

1450
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:11,840
equivalent of the White House denies a shift in Europe policy. The government is denied a shift in

1451
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:15,760
policy on the euro after the European Commission's president said the UK was, quote,

1452
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:21,440
closer than ever before. It's a joining. Right. It may not be the euro, but we're definitely going

1453
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:26,240
to move to some other monetary unit. It has to. That's what they want. That's what this one

1454
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:34,320
world government is about. That's what the, the new world order is about, uh, just a note of reference,

1455
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:39,280
from money market monitor, all these links in the show notes, a daily source, uh, drop.au,

1456
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:44,240
slash daily source code. Many Americans are pleased to see the federal deposit insurance corporation

1457
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:50,880
to FDIC raise the insurance amount of bank accounts from $250,000 to $250,000 from $100,000.

1458
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:56,560
This is, and I, and I, I'm just raising this because it's temporary. And you need to know that it

1459
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:03,600
expires on December 31st, 2009. Again, I'm starting to see a plan form here. I've really, really

1460
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:09,680
your government doesn't love you, but your bank certainly doesn't love you. Certainly not.

1461
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:15,680
Yeah, Adam, it's Matt from davidmatcho.com. I was listening to your DSCS and when we was talking

1462
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:19,760
about how the banks continue to find ways to take money from you, your money from you,

1463
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:26,240
of many years back, I'd started a college fund for my children at Morgan Stanley. And, uh,

1464
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:32,080
I'd let it go for many years and, uh, didn't notice that one of Morgan Stanley, of course,

1465
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:38,160
the leaders of the reptile nation. That's where all these guys come from, including Obama's

1466
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:43,920
fantastic economic team. This is home base, man. Morgan Stanley, uh, statements that came along

1467
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:49,520
said that they're going to be charging a, uh, quarterly fee to go along with it. Now, I didn't pay

1468
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:54,160
attention to those monthly statements. So, you know, error on me, but I was told by them,

1469
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:58,400
well, there's no need to pay attention to this. This is a long-term investment. So, I had gone

1470
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:04,000
about a year without noticing that they were taking out quarterly fees out of that until after that

1471
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:09,680
year, I had seen that I was down about $120 that I was never going to see again. So, I called them

1472
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:15,200
up, ripped them a new one, told them to send me a check for whatever the fund was worth and was

1473
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:20,400
completely taken over by the banks. So, be sure to pay attention what you're doing when you deal

1474
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:27,760
with banks. They're not always on your side. No kidding, Matt. Thanks for checking in, man. Good to hear

1475
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:32,560
from you. Hey, you know, you could always leave a message either an MP3 that you upload to the

1476
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:36,560
drop or there's a right on that page, a drop.au slash to the source code. There's a phone number

1477
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:44,240
and pin code. You use that and then you can leave a voicemail message. Um, New York Times has an

1478
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:50,320
interesting, uh, blog post titled The Worst is yet to come, almost like, you know, during Tom

1479
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:56,000
Petty, I ran downstairs and I shut the dog up. So, I can turn off the annoying noise gate. There we go.

1480
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:03,200
The Worst is yet to come, anonymous banker weighs in on the coming credit card debacle,

1481
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:09,920
which is a good read. I'm not going to go through it now, but you should take a look at that. It's

1482
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:15,280
in the show notes. Uh, and those are found, of course, at dailysourcecode.com and crossposted

1483
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:24,160
at curie.com. Just when you thought that we needed, you know, a little break in the action, a little,

1484
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:30,400
a little something from the European Union, perhaps, from maybe an expert.

1485
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:42,400
Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip.

1486
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:48,800
You just be a company, my friend. Hello, Adam. Hello, the fat carry. Use your eucrospotted tb. So,

1487
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:55,520
today we'll have to tell you a story about Jean Monne, a French, who is considered to be one of

1488
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:02,720
the funding fathers of E.O. Imagine, Monne bought a house in France from a Swedish politician.

1489
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:10,160
The price was negotiated in the US dollars, but when the sale was taking place, he insisted on buying

1490
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:17,840
it in French francs. And next day, after the sale, the franc was devalued many, many times,

1491
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:24,640
and surprise, surprise, Monne was a member of the committee that oversaw the devaluation.

1492
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:30,720
There are other words, funding fathers of E.O. Jean Monne was a congruent, a congruent, Adam.

1493
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:35,200
But Adam, I have to tell you personally, I prefer a little bit of trickery,

1494
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:41,840
conmanship than was, with killing of millions of people just because they are Jewish or Slavic.

1495
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:47,760
Yeah. Yeah. You know, I don't think the evil uberlords and shadow puppet masters or the

1496
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:53,360
energy elite, as I like to call them. I don't think they, I don't think they really care what religion,

1497
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:58,160
background, creed, color ratio are. As long as you have money, they want to take it from you.

1498
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:04,480
And that's, you know, devaluing a currency significantly. That's killing people. People can't

1499
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:11,200
pay to heat their homes. People can't, you can't afford to eat right. No, no, it's, it's just as bad.

1500
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:17,040
It really is. And I just want to remind everybody that there is a little booklet you can get at any

1501
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:21,040
library, any public library in the United States. It's called the Constitution. It's what the

1502
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:25,040
country was founded on, built upon. And it would be a great thing for all countries in the world to

1503
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:31,360
have a look at it. It has been completely forgotten in particular, in particular article eight.

1504
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:36,880
And I just want to, from time to time, remind you on what it actually says.

1505
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:47,840
The important bits, I don't even know where to start. It talks about what Congress is allowed to do

1506
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:56,480
and specifically what the states are and are not allowed to do. So let me just do a quick little

1507
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,360
browser search there. The states, okay, here we go.

1508
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:09,440
I'm not messed it up. Hold on. It's coin is what I'm looking for.

1509
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:20,240
No state shall enter into a treaty alliance or confederation, grant letters of Mark and

1510
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:31,200
reprisal, coin money, emit bills of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin a tender

1511
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:38,160
in a payment of debts. And may not pass a bill of any attainer, expost facto law or any law

1512
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:42,320
impairing the obligation of contracts or grant any title of nobility. But it says it right

1513
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:50,080
there in the Constitution. You can only use gold and silver coin to tender in the payment of debts,

1514
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:57,520
not paper, not fiat currencies, only gold and silver. Why is this overlooked? Why is this not discussed?

1515
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:03,200
It is something that it's right there. It is the founding law of the United States.

1516
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:10,880
And of course the Federal Reserve has hijacked our our system in America

1517
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:18,320
and have created this paper currency. It is not backed or based upon gold. And what can happen

1518
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:22,640
is exactly what happens to all central banks. That is what the Federal Reserve is. It was not

1519
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:27,200
a part of the government. They have a contract with the government to lend the government money

1520
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:32,800
and charge of interest. That's how we what we pay for with our taxes. And they have the printing

1521
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:38,320
press and hands. This is exactly what happened in Iceland. And now in right cubic, as you know,

1522
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:44,080
the country has broke thousands of Icelanders. There's only 300,000 of them. Mark the 90th

1523
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:48,640
anniversary of their nation sovereignty with angry protests on Monday. Several hundred stormed

1524
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:53,360
the central bank to demand the ouster of bankers. They blame for the country's spectacular

1525
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:59,920
economic meltdown. That is what's that's what's coming. It's the way to do it and it's what's coming

1526
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:04,160
if you're in the banking business. Get ready because we're coming for you with pitchforks.

1527
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:10,800
And someone left this on the drop. I love it. Yank the bank. That's what it's all about.

1528
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:16,080
Get rid of the central banks. Yank the bank. This is where we have to spread far and wide. Yank

1529
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:21,520
the bank. The Federal Reserve and the Fed. Yank the bank. And the Fed. Yank the bank.

1530
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:29,520
I love it. And there's one other thing you can do. If another were in Yank the bank mode,

1531
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:36,480
anyway, an article from Newsweek. People nationwide may start hoarding their cash as

1532
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:42,160
recession, recession fears grow. But in river west, which is in Milwaukee, residents have another

1533
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:46,560
answer to their money trouble. They're printing their own. Check this out. That's legal, by the way,

1534
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:56,480
because it's not coin. And it doesn't look like a US tender. It's the river currency. It's going to

1535
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:02,480
be used like cash at local businesses. What they do is essentially it's giving you a 10% discount

1536
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:11,040
or maybe 20%. So you go into any local store that's participating. Or in a bank, I'm sure it

1537
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:16,880
would participate in this. You give a hundred bucks. They'll give you 120 bucks in your local

1538
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:25,200
your local currency of your community, which now you can use as legal tender for goods and services.

1539
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:31,680
I like this idea. I really, really do as long as no one's printing up tons of it. And it's

1540
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:37,920
regulated somehow. Very interesting. Good article to read there. It's Newsweek.com.

1541
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:46,000
Links in the show notes at dailysourceco.com and crossposts at curie.com. All right. One more song

1542
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,720
as we get out of here. Remember, bear in mind, we need to end the Fed Yank the bank. And of course,

1543
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:57,040
we need a little bit of holiday spirit. So no one better to bring that to you than the hives and

1544
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:08,640
Cindy Lauper. I've bought no gift this year and I slept with your sister.

1545
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:25,120
I know I should have thought twice before I kissed her. But with the year we had less and the dress that she

1546
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:40,240
wore. I just went along for the ride and I came back for more. And I'm sorry baby.

1547
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:20,080
I got a better, better, better. And I know you can use it now. So I know you can use it now.

1548
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:25,120
And I know you can use it now. And I know you can use it now. And I know you can use it now.

1549
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:31,120
And I know you can use it now. And I know you can use it now. And I know you can use it now.

1550
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:44,960
We should always be late. We should always be late. We should always be late.

1551
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:57,120
And maybe you left here that you thought was so cool. Right. But I was strong as I was strong yet.

1552
01:43:57,120 --> 01:44:01,920
I made a mistake and I risked all that fail.

1553
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:12,720
I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake.

1554
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:42,720
And I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and

1556
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:39,980
I made a mistake and I made mistakes and I made a mistake and I made aragament and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and it, I made a mistake and I made a mistake which, the mistake and it, was like a mistake. The mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake and I made a mistake. and I made a mistake and I made a mistake.

1557
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:50,720
It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me

1558
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:55,720
It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me

1559
01:45:55,720 --> 01:46:00,720
It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me

1560

It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me

1563
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,720
Stingelopper in the Heights

1564
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:19,720
Christmas duel, did she actually sing I went down in your mother?

1565
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:22,720
I love it

1566
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:25,720
And wrapped up pickle of eggs, your own partner

1567
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:27,720
They make a source code

1568
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:31,720
And of course tomorrow I'll be back with you with the Noah Jenna

1569
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:34,720
Cutten that with John C. Devorek looking forward to that one

1570
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:37,720
reminder, if you're doing some Christmas shopping
