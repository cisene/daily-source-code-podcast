00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Delta Chericharly has 7-1-2.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You are listening to a man identified by the Transportation Security Administration as the Supreme Commander of the dual-ford humorist movement Adam Curry.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm testing here's Adam Curry.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Had enough, all the bad times, won't be nobody's fool free.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Curry night, all the good times.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is half things I've supposed to be.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I try new hard to please everyone else.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Always morning, myself passed.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I try to hard to feel what they're feeling.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I try to hard to make it less.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is perfect, that's what they call it.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Only for me, I feel so free now.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Only for me, no one can hold me down again.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Only for fame.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Well, you're back and what I've done.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If I made anything worth learning there, only know.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's time to have fun.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's time to live without having a care.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I do believe there's a happy end there.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Do this little fairy tale plan.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now I know I will break it for abandoned.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm going to give it all I care if I've made.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is what they call it.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Only for me, I feel so free now.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Only for me, no one can hold me down again.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Only for fame.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, you're back and what I've done.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Wow!

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You go!

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Knock down the doors and throw out the roofboards.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Nobody's coming for me now.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I hope my head higher and higher.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm going to take what's done now.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Only for fame.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's what they call it.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Only for fame.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Love feels so free now.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Only for me, no one can hold me down again.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Only for me, that's what they call it.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Only for me, no one can hold me down again.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
All right, I'll give you...

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Only for fame.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll give you two guesses worth.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes, thank you.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The shrimp has just been delivered.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's shrimp tempura, no less.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Thank you, darling.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, that's a new jersey.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But you guess that already, right?

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Actually, he's from New Jersey.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
John Tagliari.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Leap of Faith.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But he's still there, huh?

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Just as that song was ending,

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
just as I cracked the mic Patricia came up with the tempura shrimp.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh, what a life I have.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah, the John Tagliari.

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He sounds like Bon Jovi when they sell out the spark, you know what I mean?

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Remember those days when they actually still had like spark?

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I can hear Jersey boy fans.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Hearts break all over the globe at this moment.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't know.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Second, there's a little too much.

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
A little too much echo there.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah, you know what?

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I created a new show, which if you follow along my weblog at curie.com,

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
you've probably seen it.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's called soundtrack of our lives.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You can find it at opsol.podshow.com.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Of course, that's for the organization for the preservation of the soundtrack of our lives.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There's opsol.podshow.com.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And I really wanted to create a different kind of show where, you know, you basically,

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
someone would send in their story about a record.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And then I'll play that record.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And then that way we create a community soundtrack to our life.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And so I really wanted to set up kind of formatted wise.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It'll be easy for me to just sit down, read someone's story,

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and then edit the song and just release it as a show.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And hold on.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh crap.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh, come on yet.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let me just check.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is really gotten bad.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So anyway, so I set it all up.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And it blew out all the settings in my mixer.

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's what you hear me messing around with.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm trying to find the settings that I use.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I did get a good education in in logic studio, pro, whatever, because I wound up actually

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
producing the whole thing on my MacBook, which was kind of fun.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I had really never spent any time just sitting down and you know, and learning the program

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
as I normally use something on the studio PC, which is Adobe Audition.

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Not about programming.

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Actually, I think I may like it better when it comes to editing this type of stuff,

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
but Jerry still out.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So with the hell, it's Monday.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's January 21st, 2008.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This is the daily source code.

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Location is the curry manner up in the attic,

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
in the affluent suburb of Surrey, known as Gilford.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We're on the west side of G-town for those of you that don't know by now.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What should we start with?

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's up to you.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Shall we start with some red pill stuff, some polyticking or hot chicks?

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I heard that unanimous vote.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I got to tell you.

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That whole thing with the Kirstie Hawkshire.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't know if you listened on Friday.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You'll have a chance to listen again, because it's coming up in this clip that I've got for you.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Was this really, really chuck from Shai Town, from Chicago, Turn Me On Door?

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And, you know, she's really talented.

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
She's actually, she's quite well known.

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
She's done a lot of stuff with the famous DJs, like DJ Chiesto.

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
She's the voice of a lot of dance dance, and I'm not particularly my favorite kind of music.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And I played meteors, a real slow chilled out song by her.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But man, it hit a chord with the listeners, of course, with the guys,

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
which I'm still convinced is the only people actually listening to me.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's see, Chris Lacharel sent me a video to, I guess this is her.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He says she's killed her in the dress.

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let's see another one here.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, this is the Cursey Hawkshow Live with T.S. dough walking on clouds.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
A lot of people just really nuts about her, and calling up with the same message as well.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Hey Adam, this is a, hey, look at I'm not trying to get out of your show.

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
There's a mark from us about the Angela's really in all seriousness.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh, he's dead.

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This, this, this, this chick, dude.

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm telling you, it's a, she has, the Obama girl cannot touch your voice.

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sure.

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Man, what a, okay, I've had a couple of beers, but yeah.

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And my wife's not home.

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Damn.

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Same problem I had.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Holy crap.

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What a great show, dude.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
All of that.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Enjoy the weekend.

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This was great.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Hmm.

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Thanks, man.

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Really appreciate how much and on a shrimp tempura as we speak.

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
My God, what a life I have.

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I get to make shows that I like to make.

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I get served.

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I get sexy phone calls.

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Sexie feedback.

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't believe it.

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Chuck's going to set it up for you.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah.

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm Chuck from the Northwest side of Shite Town.

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh, Friday.

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Fubar was amazing.

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Totally rock.

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I just wanted to call it.

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Thank you.

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Thanks, man.

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's beautiful.

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Chris, we got to be kick out of that.

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And she said.

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let me just imagine for those of you just joining the show, which I can, I can imagine.

171
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The setup is that Chuck turned me on to her and got her to create really sexy

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
show ID's for me.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And I just sexy sexy stuff.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And I guess Chuck is helping her out with Chuck's trying to get into her pants, honestly.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Listen to the rest of the message.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Ident response.

177
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So I'm going to email it to you as well just so you get it.

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And she also was taking her response too.

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So we threw it up.

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
There's a podcast six at the Kirstie Haksha podcast.com, which is also on pod show.

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So anyway, I hope you had enough some weekend.

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Best of Lady Patricia.

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Hope she's recovering well.

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And rock on, man.

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Rock on.

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Thank you for that.

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So Chuck signing off.

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And.

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Love you.

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I mean it.

191
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Great hair.

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Hope you.

193
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Thank you.

194
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Love you.

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Meena.

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Great hair.

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hope you win.

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Back at you, my friend.

199
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm sorry about that.

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm telling you everything's all fucked up with my system.

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I hate that.

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Um.

203
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So what's going to cool?

204
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm being very rude eating in front of you.

206
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So I go over and check out the Kirstie Haksha podcast, which is, indeed, is on poncho.com.

207
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And of course, you'll find a link to this in the show.

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No, it's a daily source code dot com or the cross posting at curie dot com.

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm going to play this whole thing.

210
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's about four minutes.

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So you'll actually hear me talking about Kirstie about Chuck.

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But the camera is on Kirstie.

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And she's got this like really sexy, low cut t-shirt.

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh man.

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
She looked even better than the videos.

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And so you can see all of her facial expressions and her response as well.

217
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So he's listening to this for the first time.

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So there's, uh, I'll just run you through it.

219
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay.

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The audio's pretty pretty decent.

221
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Mine.

222
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're going to the email from her another up there.

223
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
She has to play some more.

224
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay.

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So she's looking right in the camera right now.

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
She's got maybe it's, uh, it actually it's not a t-shirt.

227
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It almost looks like a, um, what do you call one of those things that, uh,

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
uh, one of those, um, not quite jacket.

229
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Like, uh, the keeps really warm and winter.

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh, god.

231
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
My brain is for doesn't matter because I'm not actually looking at the garment.

232
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm looking at the little cut part of it.

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, that ain't.

234
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And it's her, it's her in her studio.

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's really cool.

236
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
She's got a, you know, he looks like a 24 track mixing board in the back.

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I almost looks like she's kind of in a basement vibe.

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So it's all, it's very grungy and it's black and white and sexy beyond belief.

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Bitch.

240
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And it makes me feel good.

241
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And then, of course, there's guys like Chuck.

242
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Hey, Adam.

243
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So she's, she's got him out there for now.

244
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
She's surprised.

245
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
She's surprised.

246
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
She's happy.

247
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
She's screaming.

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Hey, um, I just emailed you to Adamacrid.com to audio bumpers.

249
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And of course, that wasn't mistake.

250
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It took Chuck, uh, another try.

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Don't send it to Adamacrid.com.

252
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Send it to Adamacpodshow.com.

253
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Her work, uh, from crispy hoxia.

254
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The, uh, the chance to leave us from open three back in the day.

255
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Remember 92.

256
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

257
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
She's not out.

258
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
She's like shaking her head going like, oh, no.

259
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
She's embarrassed.

260
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You know, it's, it's a good, um, healthy dose of, uh, um,

261
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
of embarrassment having people talk about her.

262
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But as an artista, of course, I know she's really happy.

263
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Deep inside.

264
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Um, anyway, I just, uh, you know the most to Adamacrid.com.

265
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I want her to make sure you got him.

266
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And, uh, and then I can do a little preview.

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Just listen to Chuck.

268
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Oh, cool.

269
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So that's the ideas that she made.

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I just shot him off to you.

271
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So, um, yeah.

272
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Let me know if you think.

273
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Check out our new tunes and, uh,

274
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
public music network.

275
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
She uploaded seven of them.

276
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And, uh, we're talking up some stuff for NGB too.

277
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So, uh, oh, she's looking really into camera.

278
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah.

279
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You think of both of us.

280
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I sent you.

281
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What have you done, Chuck?

282
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
All right, man.

283
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Lovely.

284
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Meet it.

285
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Great hair.

286
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Hope you win.

287
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Okay.

288
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I love you.

289
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I mean, it's going to help you win.

290
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Thank you.

291
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And maybe it's something she says that love you mean a great hair.

292
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Hope you win.

293
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's sure her response was like, oh, this is so great.

294
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And she, and, and, uh, man, she leaned back and she went,

295
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and then she immediately closed up the, uh, the garment again.

296
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
A fleece.

297
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's what it's called.

298
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Fleece.

299
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's almost as good as, uh, get Cape where Cape fly.

300
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Let me hear that again.

301
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That was pretty cool.

302
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I got to remember this one.

303
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
All right, man.

304
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Love you, meet it.

305
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,500
Great hair.

306
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
I love you, meet it.

307
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
Great hair.

308
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Hope you win.

309
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Absolutely.

310
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Hi.

311
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
This is Kirsty Hope Show.

312
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
I'm listening to Adam.

313
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
She's laughing at her own voice.

314
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
She's soft coat.

315
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,500
See, he sends me the artwork with her and a little DSC logo on it.

316
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
She is beautiful.

317
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Of course.

318
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Oh, she's, she's, she's waving on air in her face.

319
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Oh, he gets me, uh, an ID.

320
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Of course, I'm going to play this song.

321
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
And now she's looking at the camera.

322
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I can't hear that now.

323
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
To the end of the song.

324
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Yeah.

325
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
I could play that.

326
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
I could accompany her.

327
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Percy.

328
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
She's beautiful.

329
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Yeah, we'd make a nice, uh, I wonder what tall she is.

330
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Yeah.

331
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Oh, how long for the good old days?

332
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Yeah, she had when I say I wonder how tall she is.

333
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
She does this like, huh?

334
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Why is he asking that?

335
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
That's because I'm rather tall, Percy.

336
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
I just want to make sure we kind of fit together that the picture will look right.

337
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,500
When the talent would just blow the DJ to get their song played.

338
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Now, these days, kind of just got to do it with a picture.

339
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Okay.

340
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Percy Hawkshaw.

341
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
And meteors.

342
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,500
And, of course, you'll find links to that song and all the songs played

343
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,500
on today's football Friday in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

344
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
I've got an idea for an idea.

345
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Okay.

346
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,500
So, so in response to what Adam just said, I just knocked up a quick cheeky

347
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
idea.

348
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Here it is.

349
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Okay.

350
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,500
You know, oh, actually, yeah, this might sound good from the video.

351
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,500
It's a whole she did a whole second angle on this and she actually edited that.

352
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,500
And so she's now she's replying to my question.

353
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,500
What happened to the good old days when talent would just blow the DJ

354
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
to get their song played on the radio?

355
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
In the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

356
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
I've got an idea for an idea.

357
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Okay.

358
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,500
So in response to what Adam just said, I just knocked up a quick cheeky

359
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
idea.

360
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Here it is.

361
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Yeah, those were the days.

362
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:08,500
I'm actually getting to blow the DJ to get your radio plays.

363
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,500
How am I going to get Adam Curie's attention again?

364
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Oh, he's a phone number.

365
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
I'll give it a ring.

366
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Well, the video says, Adam, thank you.

367
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Ah, isn't that cute?

368
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:34,500
Wait, let me play the, let me play the high-res version.

369
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Because I like it so much.

370
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
It's really cool.

371
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
So nice of you, Curci.

372
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Yeah, those were the days.

373
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,500
When you actually get to blow the DJ to get your radio plays.

374
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,500
How am I going to get Adam Curie's attention again?

375
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Oh, he's a phone number.

376
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
I'll give it a ring.

377
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Plus, 4, 4, 2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3.

378
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Ah, Curci.

379
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Every time you call that number and you say something sexy,

380
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
I'm going to play one of your songs.

381
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
So all you have to do is tell me which one you want me to play.

382
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
I'm like a million up there.

383
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
And I can't wait until we speak again, my dear.

384
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Hey, Adam.

385
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,500
This is Maurice Osondar here from the Sunnis and Adam.

386
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,500
The dude with a free CD of the best of the Sunnis and Adam,

387
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,500
which you can order at www.Sunnisandand.com.

388
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Thanks for playing the promo, man.

389
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
That was pretty cool.

390
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
The orders are keep coming in as we speak.

391
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,500
You asked for more info about this idea.

392
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,500
So I thought let's give you a comment on that.

393
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,500
And of course, I had contact with these artists on the CD.

394
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,500
You know, I got this CD because I wanted their music off the three players

395
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,500
and computers and get it into the living rooms and the CD racks over there.

396
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,500
So, yeah, these artists deserve that.

397
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,500
So to do something in return, I worked out this idea.

398
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm first I talked to Carmen Tyler about this idea.

399
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,500
What she, you know, as an artist, thought of this concept and this thing.

400
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,500
And she was enthusiastic right away.

401
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,500
So I contacted the other artists and asked if they wanted to join.

402
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,500
And well, except for one, everyone was thrilled with the idea.

403
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
So yes, right away.

404
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,500
So I guess the one who didn't say yes and I was banging her head to the wall.

405
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,500
You know, this is a very interesting project that Maurice Osondar set up for the Sunnis.

406
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
The Sunnis Sundown podcast.

407
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,500
And what he's done essentially is he's created a CD of pod, pod save music that he's played on his show.

408
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
And he got permission from all the artists.

409
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
That was my question essentially.

410
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
And he's not selling it.

411
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,500
He's giving it away, which is I think just awesome.

412
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,500
I don't know if he's producing them in bulk or if he's just burning him at home.

413
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,500
But, you know, in certain, which of course is a very valid way to do it.

414
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
But still, you know, that's got to be a couple of times a CD.

415
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
And I got to say that's awesome idea.

416
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,500
And he's letting his listeners have it, which I agree.

417
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,500
I think is a great way to get you get stuff out of the digital realm, make it tangible.

418
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,500
It's a great way to introduce people to pod save music.

419
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
And it's given me a couple ideas.

420
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
I mean, why wouldn't we do the best of the daily source code?

421
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I mean, shit.

422
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,500
If the artists are into it and, you know,

423
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
I can just basically give it away.

424
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Oh, man.

425
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
I got some strategies where we could actually make some money doing that.

426
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,500
If we could build the brand, you know, powerful enough,

427
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,500
why wouldn't newspapers want to distribute free music with their papers?

428
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,500
They do it here in the UK all the time, granted with established artists.

429
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,500
But if you turn it, you know, if you brand it properly and say these are the,

430
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,500
you know, this is like the up and coming UK talent as an example.

431
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
I think we could probably sell it to them.

432
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,500
We could probably all make a couple under box.

433
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Maybe even more.

434
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
It's a great, great concept.

435
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,500
But yeah, this, this gives a good opportunity for these artists as well.

436
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,500
They get, we'll get some CD stew so they can spread it around in their network.

437
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Yep.

438
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,500
And they're at a gig or something or want to get to fans or something like that.

439
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Or for like using it as demo kind of stuff like that.

440
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Now, we don't make any direct money from the CD, of course.

441
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,500
It's just a promotion, promotion value that creates.

442
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,500
I handled the distribution myself and so these discussed ceremony.

443
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,500
And so the name sponsor interlocks and the immediate network.

444
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,500
I mentioned in the promo is the name of my website.

445
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,500
www to interlock the mill.

446
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,500
It's main page where all my podcast products are coming together and syndicated, syndicated there.

447
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,500
So this is how we can promote these artists and my show, of course.

448
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Yeah, I love it, Maurice.

449
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
It's a great idea, man.

450
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
FedTAS.

451
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:58,500
If you go check out a show, go request order, a copy of a CD, which as far as I can tell, it's completely free.

452
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
And it's a great collection.

453
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,500
It really is some good songs on there by a well-established pod safe artist.

454
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,500
You know, we've got the finally have the codes for the Nokia N8010, which you can now buy

455
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
to 15% discount.

456
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:18,500
I've not seen it at cheaper anywhere without all kinds of tricks like ordering, actually credit cards and stuff like that.

457
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:25,500
And you can do it by going to the Nokia Store, NokiaUSA.com slash N8010.

458
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:34,500
We have a special link for UK residents, which is BT Podshow.com slash N8010.

459
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,500
And if you enter in the promo code daily source code, you'll get your 15% discount.

460
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Now, more countries coming online have already seen Italy store, which is coming online soon.

461
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,500
I think France was coming online.

462
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
They're doing their best.

463
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,500
It's quite interesting for Nokia as a company, because I don't think they have a lot of experience

464
00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:00,500
with this type of a setup where you basically have people selling their stuff.

465
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Now, they just expanded their sales force across all these podshow programming and fantastic response.

466
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,500
I have no idea about sales numbers yet, but I know certainly several people have already ordered one.

467
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:19,500
If not through using my code, one of the other podshow podcast network programs.

468
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,500
And pretty soon we'll be opening this up much wider, so any show can participate.

469
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
This is a new customer.

470
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,500
It's a new, we're really trying something new both for us and for them.

471
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:36,500
So we want to keep the first group a little bit controlled, a little small, so we can actually oversee what's going on.

472
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:42,500
But I think it's going quite well, so with a bit of luck we'll be able to open that up to more more shows across the network.

473
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:49,500
More information on that in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com, of course also at curie.com.

474
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,500
And talking, okay, so we get into some red pill stuff here for a second.

475
00:22:53,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Well, before we get into the red pill, atomic rod, who is, of course, my nuclear energy savant called in with answers to my questions about nuclear facilities being put up by 2020 in the United Kingdom.

476
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
The atomic rod items here are your energy savant.

477
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Sorry about the rather useless common galasio.

478
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Everybody has a bad day.

479
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:19,500
The UK government has announced after a lengthy public comment period that nuclear power plants should be encouraged.

480
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,500
But they will not provide any subsidies.

481
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Even with that statement, there are a lot of companies that are interested in the market.

482
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,500
Several of the largest utility companies in Europe are lining up.

483
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Partner power plants suppliers, according to a recent article in the Guardian Unlimited, the plants make financial sense because of high oil and gas prices, along with the costs that are being imposed for carbon emissions to meet key elements.

484
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,500
The most likely sites for the new plants are the places that already have nuclear power plants.

485
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,500
All those sites are owned by British energy.

486
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,500
So there's a lot of talk about needing until 2020 for new plants.

487
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,500
The most recent experience in Asia is a construction period of about five years.

488
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:07,500
A new nuclear plant replaces the need to burn about 1.7 billion cubic meters of gas each year.

489
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,500
That removes about 500 million in sales from the gas supply.

490
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:17,500
It looks like the interest in nuclear in the UK is encouraging a new discussion in the rest of Europe.

491
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
Okay, so that's interesting.

492
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,500
So the gas guys are running interference.

493
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Is that where you're saying their atomic rod?

494
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,500
That is quite interesting.

495
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,500
And I had no idea that plants could come online in five years.

496
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,500
That means seven years earlier than they're predicting the plants could come online at the current pace.

497
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Interesting.

498
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,500
And I have to say, of course, I peruse to the Guardian once in a while.

499
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Very left-wing paper.

500
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,500
But I'm pretty selective.

501
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,500
The message is definitely differently in the mainstream media here, so that's always interesting rod.

502
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
It's a necessary tool in the fight against greenhouse gas emissions.

503
00:24:53,500 --> 00:25:04,500
And it is a heck of a lot better than depending solely on the good graces of Iran and Russia to keep increasing their sales of natural gas to cover those days and the wind is not blowing.

504
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Far better for countries like the UK and the USA to build up their nuclear power plant industry and provide good jobs for tens of thousands of local engineers.

505
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,500
Technicians, security guards and operators.

506
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,500
And to keep sending pounds or dollars to place like Iran.

507
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria or France.

508
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
That's right.

509
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,500
If the Brits fight nuclear plants too hard, the French will be more than happy to build them in France.

510
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,500
And sell the Brits to power they need to keep their gadgets coming.

511
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
Yep.

512
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
You'll write on when it comes to safety.

513
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,500
The record of the industry is pretty spectacular.

514
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,500
And comparing Chernobyl to a modern reactor is a bit like comparing your jag to a Hugo.

515
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:52,500
As an aside, the back yard nuclear power plant business may also be looking up soon.

516
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,500
But I cannot share any damned announcements.

517
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
Folder, red pill.

518
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
Love you.

519
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,500
Yeah.

520
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Love you too, man.

521
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,500
Awesome.

522
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
Thank you, atomic rod.

523
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
Really appreciate that.

524
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,500
And keep us up to speed on what's going on with these nuclear plants.

525
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,500
And in general, you should learn a little bit more about nuclear energy.

526
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,500
Because the safety record is fantastic.

527
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,500
The waste is not like green group that oozes around.

528
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:24,500
You know, how to learn some of this when had rod on in one of the savants series.

529
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,500
So it's definitely alternative that needs to be looked at.

530
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
You just do your own research.

531
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Not with the help we have Google for.

532
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,500
Oops.

533
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
I come that didn't work.

534
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
There we go.

535
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Hey, Adam.

536
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
This is Dean.

537
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Beautiful Morgan LA.

538
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
I was just listening to DSC 709.

539
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
And I got to tell you.

540
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,500
I heard you talking about how you're jealous about being alive.

541
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
And my opinion.

542
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Podcasting is the way to go.

543
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:55,500
I think you have a larger audience because hey, we can listen to you whenever we want.

544
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
And that's the way I feel.

545
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Anyway, just want to pass that along.

546
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Make a comment here.

547
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Hey.

548
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Folder.

549
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
No.

550
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
I'm a hybrid.

551
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Now, I used to be a sprinter and now I'm a hybrid.

552
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500
Anyway.

553
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Love you.

554
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
No homo.

555
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
I don't know.

556
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
No homo man.

557
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
I don't know how that works.

558
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
How you can be a hybrid.

559
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,500
But you know, there is, I'm still going to try some live shows.

560
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,500
And it doesn't really matter because it's not like, well, only people who are participating

561
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,500
in the show at that very moment will actually be able to hear anything.

562
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,500
So in the first brush of the test that I'm still planning.

563
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,500
What is it not two, three weeks?

564
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,500
It's more just to get people to talk to than it being live.

565
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,500
I obviously want you to be able to get the file, the minute it's ready and listen to it.

566
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,500
And the only real timing issue is participation.

567
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,500
If you want to participate, then we have to somehow come up with a schedule or an agreement or a

568
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
time so that you can plan your life.

569
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
And my life is already complicated.

570
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
So I don't want to change any plans.

571
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,500
And I did get a nice email and voice mail from Alan Levy.

572
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
He's the founder of blog talk radio.

573
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,500
And I'd kind of dismiss blog talk radio because they don't have the functions I was looking

574
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,500
for like a mute and an unmute function.

575
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,500
And he sent me a login to test some stuff and they've got some new features coming out,

576
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,500
which might just be perfect to satisfy my needs.

577
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,500
Because really what I'm thinking here is I want a mix mine.

578
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,500
And next mine is basically the signal from my mixer.

579
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,500
I want to go into the phone line, which in this case will be Skype, I guess.

580
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,500
Because that is much more reliable just to listen to people on the phone.

581
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Unfortunately, we just can't rely on the, on the VoIP technologies yet.

582
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Unless you're using VoIP to call into their phone bank.

583
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,500
So I'll still get phone quality back.

584
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,500
But the people on the call will be able to hear the show and hear the other callers.

585
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
But not themselves.

586
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
I guess I'm saying that right?

587
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,500
There won't be any feedback the way I potentially have it set up in my head, at least.

588
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
So I do want to try it.

589
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,500
I really do because I enjoy speaking to other people about topics.

590
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,500
And you know, that's kind of what I was trying to do with the sabons.

591
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,500
But again, you get into this whole, you know, if you got to basically produce the show.

592
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
And guess what?

593
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
I got no time for that.

594
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,500
A couple of reports here.

595
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Good article at the times.

596
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
The London Times.

597
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,500
On flight thirty eight.

598
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Some good data points in there.

599
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
They finally talked to some pilots.

600
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:28,500
And they, you know, and they have some good information on, you know,

601
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,500
basically what happens in the plane the last two thousand feet.

602
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,500
How the autopilot and auto throttle are engaged and disengaged.

603
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Then some other data about previous triple sevens that have had problems similar to this.

604
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
But a different situations.

605
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,500
August 1st, 2005 Malaysian Airlines triple seven from Perth to

606
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Kuala Lumpur was climbing past 38,000 feet.

607
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:59,500
And the crew was confronted with what the official report of the incident described as a situation that had previously been considered not possible.

608
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,500
They got a low speed warning suggesting the plan was approaching stalling speed.

609
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,500
Almost simultaneously the primary flight display screen warned exactly the opposite.

610
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,500
The aircraft was approaching the over speed limit.

611
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,500
And then what happened is all of a sudden.

612
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,500
This craft, the pitch that's nose up, the autopilot did that climb.

613
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,500
And then they really started to saw a stall as they got, you know,

614
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,500
what happens then is the the yolk or the stick starts to shake.

615
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,500
And so you know, they've got to put pitch that nose down immediately.

616
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,500
So it seems like the triple seven may have had certainly some electrical problems.

617
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,500
And electrical problems in a fly by wire aircraft can, of course, lead to, well,

618
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,500
bad shit.

619
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
That's for sure.

620
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,500
So I'll put a link in the show notes so you can take a look at that at your leisure.

621
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,500
And let me see some more things I've collected here.

622
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,500
Bush pardons himself retroactively.

623
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,500
This is a very interesting piece of data that see who sent this to me.

624
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,500
It's opening up the the Gmail as we speak and I can tell you.

625
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Ah, there we go.

626
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,500
Ian Kath.

627
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Okay.

628
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
I can think he's from Australia.

629
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
Let's follow this link.

630
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
You should listen to this.

631
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
This is pretty interesting.

632
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
This is from the situation.

633
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
I'll be getting to think with the wolf blitzer.

634
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
I've done these interviews yesterday.

635
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
An iteration.

636
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
This is actually quite disturbing when you listen to this.

637
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
When was this video posted?

638
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
Three days ago.

639
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Listen to this on your door asking for transcripts.

640
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Ordinarily, we don't do a question two days in a row.

641
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,500
But this is important enough to be an exception.

642
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,500
The house just passed President Bush's bill to redefine the treatment of the

643
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Tainees and the Senate's expected to do the same thing tomorrow.

644
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Very deep inside this legislation is a provision that will pardon President Bush and all

645
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,500
the members of his administration of any possible crimes connected with the torture

646
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,500
and mistreatment of detainees dated all the way back to September 11, 2001.

647
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,500
At least President Nixon had Gerald Ford to do his dirty work.

648
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,500
President Bush is trying to pardon himself.

649
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
Here's the deal.

650
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Under the War crimes Act, violations of the Geneva conventions are felonies, in some cases punishable by death.

651
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:19,500
When the Supreme Court ruled that Geneva conventions applied to al Qaeda and Taliban detainees,

652
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,500
President Bush and his boys were suddenly in big trouble.

653
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
They've been working these prisoners over pretty good.

654
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:30,500
In an effort to avoid possible prosecution, they're trying to cram this bill through Congress before the end of the week when

655
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Congress adjourns.

656
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:36,500
The reason there's such a rush to do this, if the Democrats get control of the house in November,

657
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,500
well, this kind of legislation probably wouldn't pass.

658
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,500
You want to know the real disgrace of what these people are about to do or in the process of doing

659
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Senator Bill Frist and Congressman Dennis Hasterd and their Republican studios.

660
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
Apparently, don't see anything wrong with this.

661
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,500
I really do wonder sometimes what we're becoming in this country.

662
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:00,500
The question is this, should Congress pass a bill giving retroactive immunity to President Bush

663
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,500
a possible war crimes?

664
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
You may have your thoughts to carefully file.

665
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
So that was the check-offer.

666
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
How come that guy doesn't get more airtime?

667
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,500
He should be doing.

668
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
He should be doing a show like Anderson Cooper.

669
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Man, that guy is always right on the money.

670
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,500
He's always down deep, but he's always showing up in other people's shows.

671
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,500
But you never really tune into watch his show.

672
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,500
He needs some like star vehicle, because the guy has got it going on.

673
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
He's got the research.

674
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
He's got the stories.

675
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
He's not afraid to report on him.

676
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,500
No fear, no favor, which is the,

677
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,500
the financial times is slogan.

678
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,500
I like it.

679
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,500
No fear, no favor.

680
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,500
I just may have to borrow that one.

681
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,500
So if you have any information on that bill, of course,

682
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:47,500
it being mainstream media, there was no detailed information that really helped me out with anything.

683
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,500
I'd like to know about it because we've got to start bitching about it,

684
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,500
because that is just disgusting.

685
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
Absolutely disgusting.

686
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,500
And I'll bet you there's a lot more going to be uncovered when we get to the bottom of this one.

687
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
Adam Curry.

688
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,500
Yeah.

689
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Um, I'm curious.

690
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,500
So, let's go.

691
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
What is red pill?

692
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,500
I've missed a little bit of the DSC way behind, like, a year behind.

693
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:19,500
But so I'd like to know what you're referring to as red pill.

694
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
Thank you very much.

695
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Tell me what I say.

696
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Yeah, I catch you, Mike.

697
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Yeah.

698
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,500
My name is Mark Finkel.

699
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Uh, go watch the movie The Matrix, Mark.

700
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,500
And then see the choices that are given.

701
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
You take the blue pill.

702
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
You wake up.

703
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Everything stays the same.

704
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,500
You take the red pill.

705
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,500
You go down the rabbit hole, my friend.

706
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
And join the revolution.

707
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,500
That's what the red pill is all about.

708
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Hey there, Adam.

709
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
This is Andrew from Ottawa, Canada.

710
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,500
I thought I'd send in an audio comment about what's going on in Afghanistan.

711
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,500
Like you.

712
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
I try and understand these things as well.

713
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,500
And I had a once on a lifetime opportunity earlier 2007.

714
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Did you see things up close for our Canadian Army?

715
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,500
It's me to go on a one week trip across to Afghanistan to bring.

716
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,500
Let me just stop them for a second.

717
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,500
I did get a lot of comments from people who heard the Noah Jen to show.

718
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,500
And I think I mentioned on the Daily Source Code as well, where I said, you know,

719
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:21,500
so basically we've got the Dutch, the English, and the Canadians in Afghanistan.

720
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,500
And I said, you know, the typical asslickers.

721
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,500
But just so we're very, very clear on one thing.

722
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,500
I'm not talking about the military, not talking about the troops, not talking about the

723
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,500
guys and gals who are actually doing this fucked up work.

724
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
I'm talking about the politicians.

725
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
I'm talking about the people running the country.

726
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,500
I can see the prime minister of the Netherlands, young pay to bulk in Andy.

727
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
He's a total asslicker.

728
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
We know about Tony Blair.

729
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,500
And God, do I have something to say about Gordon Brown in a moment?

730
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,500
So it kind of makes sense that Canada would, you know, based on his proximity.

731
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
It's relationship with the US.

732
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,500
I know that it's a United Nations call out.

733
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
But how come it's only these three countries?

734
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,500
One is the smaller than the state of Rhode Island.

735
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Come on.

736
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,500
And then I guess I said, well, what do we do in Afghanistan anyway?

737
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,500
Let's move away from Iraq just for one second.

738
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Let's just focus our attention on Afghanistan.

739
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,500
Please explain to me, what are we doing there?

740
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,500
Besides getting blown up.

741
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Hopefully Andrew couldn't fill this in on the Canadian involvement.

742
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,500
Our Stanley Cup, our hockey trophy and hockey players and the music from Newfoundland

743
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,500
to cheer up the troops over on Canada.

744
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
It was an incredible trip.

745
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
They're amazing people doing an amazing job.

746
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
It was quite something.

747
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,500
By the way, that trip and the visa stamp in my passport has screwed up all my border crossings.

748
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,500
So the last guard actually said, ship, what's this Afghanistan stuff?

749
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
So I can feel for you with your Iraq stamps and your passport.

750
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Yeah, that's what happened.

751
00:36:53,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Canada, in the south of Afghanistan, is one of the oldest cities in the entire world founded by Alexander the Great

752
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
and sacked by Ganges Khan.

753
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,500
A lot of people know it as the country invaded by Russia.

754
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,500
In Canada, there is a cave with the cape of the Prophet Muhammad.

755
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,500
This is a very holy city.

756
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:20,500
This cape was worn by Bin Laden and Sheikh Omar before they were chased out of the country by US Special Forces in Korea.

757
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Really? How does that work?

758
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,500
So they go into the sacred cave and they just said, I'm a size four.

759
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,500
That's perfect.

760
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
I'll just wear this cape.

761
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Or is it something that's passed on from leader to leader?

762
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
I'd love to know more about that.

763
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:41,500
This desolate isolated country so close to Pakistan and Iran plays a key part in the entire Middle East

764
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500
process.

765
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,500
And allowing the Taliban to continue to operate in that country is unacceptable.

766
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,500
So there have been two main thrusts in that country since 2001.

767
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:59,500
And the biggest one is Operation Enduring Freedom, which is the US's anti-911 forces kicking people out of the country.

768
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,500
There's a parallel force being run by NATO forces.

769
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:10,500
They're invited in by the Karzai government to restore power, police, basic infrastructure

770
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
and start training the country back up again.

771
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,500
It's really been decimated by 40 years of war.

772
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,500
So I got it.

773
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,500
I got it.

774
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,500
That makes sense because I follow the Dutch news.

775
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:27,500
And clearly the Dutch troops went in as, you know, as people who are going to rebuild the country.

776
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
Yeah, it's the same old story, right?

777
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,500
Train the police force, stabilize, etc.

778
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,500
And the reason why has got to be pretty evident at this point.

779
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:42,500
But it's certainly not to go looking for bin Laden walking around with a cave.

780
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:50,500
So, so of all the United Nations countries, we still have the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Canada.

781
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,500
And Denmark, I think, I've done some homework now.

782
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,500
The US forces are separate from the NATO forces.

783
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,500
And the NATO forces are mainly composed of the British, Canadian, and the Dutch.

784
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
Okay, it's NATO, I'm sorry.

785
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,500
NATO, not UN NATO.

786
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,500
I think about US defense secretary Gates comments about NATO.

787
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,500
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

788
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:14,500
NATO doesn't stand for North American trade organization.

789
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,500
How come they get to call up wars and stuff?

790
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
Do they have that right?

791
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,500
Is that what they're in business for?

792
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,500
Oh boy, let me see.

793
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,500
Surely there's a, let's see, is there a NATO website?

794
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,500
There must be, they must have some kind of mission statement.

795
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Let's see, we find home on NATO.

796
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,500
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, there you go.

797
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
NATO.int makes sense.

798
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
What is NATO?

799
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
Okay, let's click on what is NATO?

800
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
Go, we got a pop up here.

801
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,500
Nice, nice pop up guys.

802
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
What is NATO?

803
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Okay.

804
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,500
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, is an alliance of 26 countries.

805
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
26?

806
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
No less.

807
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:08,500
From North America and Europe committed to fulfilling the goals of the North Atlantic Treaty signed on 4th April 1949.

808
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Okay, there's a link to the North Atlantic Treaty, that's nice.

809
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:24,500
Now here we go, the parties to this treaty reaffirm their faith in purposes and principle to the charter of the United Nations and their desire to live in peace with all peoples and all governments.

810
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:34,500
Okay, they are determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.

811
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,500
They seek to promote stability and well-being in the North Atlantic area.

812
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Ah, the law of base.

813
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,500
It's not quite the North Atlantic.

814
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:49,500
They are resolved to unite their efforts for collective defense and for the preservation of peace and security.

815
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:58,500
They therefore agree to this North Atlantic Treaty, and then you've got all kinds of articles and that's pretty interesting.

816
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Doesn't seem like it's exactly their charter, but I'd have to delve into it a little deeper to know for sure.

817
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,500
But it doesn't seem like their jobs should be sending people to war.

818
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:15,500
And of course, Afghanistan, I don't think their member of NATO, are they?

819
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,500
Need to check that.

820
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,500
No, tactics in Afghanistan.

821
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:27,500
I think it comes at a particularly sensitive time right now when after Budo's assassination, there's a big upsurge and violence coming out of the tribal areas in Pakistan.

822
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:39,500
The elements of the Taliban are surging and I think it's a little frustrating for all the military commanders at all the restrictions that they have in all the different kinds of rules for each country fighting in these large alliances.

823
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:50,500
But I think relatively speaking, NATO forces aren't really as well trained at fighting these complicated long-term surgencies, as say, a more conventional military attack with clear battle lines.

824
00:41:50,500 --> 00:42:02,500
But I have to say that my experience over in Afghanistan, in Canada, our Canadian soldiers are adapting and changing every day to meet their incredible things they face of the IEDs on the side of the road and everything.

825
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:08,500
It's quite amazing to see and I was blown away by their professionalism and determination in the face of such a

826
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,500
odds.

827
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,500
It's quite something.

828
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:17,500
I think the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark all have a lot to be proud of for what they're doing over there.

829
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,500
The opium is part of the story.

830
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
Foreign insurgents are part of the story.

831
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,500
It's a huge story.

832
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,500
It takes a while to get around.

833
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,500
But I applaud you for bringing up on the show and bringing people more information.

834
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,500
I think everyone needs to know more.

835
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,500
So anyway, folder and I'm not going to say I love you.

836
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,500
So fuck you, Adam Curry.

837
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
I love you anyway, man.

838
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,500
No, homo.

839
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,500
Okay, I'd like to know more about NATO and how that actually works.

840
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,500
I guess that's the next step to understanding this because it just makes no sense.

841
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:54,500
And every single day I wake up and I have conversations with my wife and she listens to the BBC, which is still heavily biased towards all kinds of creepy things.

842
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,500
And we have conversations about this.

843
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,500
I say look, Ron Paul has the right idea.

844
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,500
Take everyone out.

845
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
Just take this leave.

846
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,500
I've pocketed on.

847
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,500
Use that $10 billion we spent.

848
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
You know, why are we over there?

849
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:14,500
I think we all know kind of the answer, but I still want to hear someone say it and I want NATO to cop to it.

850
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,500
I would make things so much easier.

851
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:25,500
As long as we understand why, of course, we give big props to our soldiers as I do to our policemen, our firemen, our teachers.

852
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500
But not to Gordon Brown.

853
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,500
I just want to say one thing briefly to the UK listeners.

854
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,500
Okay, I'm going to change my opinion on Gordon Brown.

855
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,500
I thought this would be a great patriarchal figure.

856
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,500
He would be good for the country.

857
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,500
And now that I've really scrutinized him and he's had a chance to be in office for a couple of months.

858
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,500
This guy's a fucking tool.

859
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,500
And I don't know who he's working for.

860
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:52,500
But, you know, he's a fiscalist because he was the, the chancellor of the, extracur.

861
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,500
Basically, the dude who takes care of all the finances.

862
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,500
So he's a fiscalist.

863
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,500
He understands very well what's going on.

864
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:09,500
And of course, he indirectly or directly approved this 24 billion pound loan of UK taxpayers money,

865
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,500
which includes mine as well.

866
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,500
You know, we do employ 15 people over here.

867
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,500
You know, we do pay corporate taxes.

868
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,500
You know, it's our money, too.

869
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,500
To bail out a bank, a commercial institution to bail out Northern Rock.

870
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,500
And I just want to say a few things for the US listeners.

871
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,500
You have to understand Northern Rock is really almost like a building society.

872
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,500
It's more that's hence the Northern Rock.

873
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,500
It was really built.

874
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:38,500
I would have to say on the back of the wages of, of hard working Northerners in the UK.

875
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,500
A lot of minors.

876
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,500
I'm sure I contributed to the assets of the bank.

877
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,500
And really, it's a lending bank.

878
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,500
And, and as well as a, I think a retail commercial bank,

879
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,500
but lending bank above all for mortgages.

880
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,500
And they fucked up.

881
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,500
They were a part of the big game, which is now probably in the fourth inning.

882
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:02,500
Of what could it could turn out to be a much longer than it could be a 12 inning.

883
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
Easily.

884
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,500
But what kind of it's, you know, a third of the quarterway through this credit crunch

885
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,500
and banks are doing all kinds of crazy stuff because they've got to save their own asses.

886
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,500
Now remember, banks are commercial.

887
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,500
You know, it's not like it's not like we're shareholders.

888
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,500
Well, that just actually might happen because

889
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,500
So Gordon Brown signed this check.

890
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
It bailed out Northern Rock.

891
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,500
And now they've been waiting.

892
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,500
It's now coming up on two months.

893
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,500
Is someone going to come in and buy it?

894
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,500
Or are they going to nationalize it?

895
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,500
Now remember banks have shareholders.

896
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,500
So these shareholders, they're pretty much fucked either way.

897
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,500
But if someone comes in with private money,

898
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,500
at least there's some chance of working out a deal,

899
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,500
so they can get a couple pennies on the dollar.

900
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,500
If, if it's a nationalized, which means the government,

901
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,500
the country, the state basically owns it,

902
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
then all the shareholders get screwed over.

903
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,500
And they'll probably get zero.

904
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,500
Which is what the bank is worth,

905
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,500
except for the fact that there's a 24 billion pound loan

906
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,500
sitting right there.

907
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
That's 50 billion dollars.

908
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Now, here's what's happening.

909
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,500
Uh, those are you in the UK.

910
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,500
You've seen Gordon Brown in China.

911
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,500
You've seen him on the news continuously.

912
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,500
And lo and behold,

913
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,500
who's along for the ride?

914
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,500
But Sir Richard Branson.

915
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,500
Now, you can tell me a lot about Richard Branson.

916
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,500
Uh, but there are very few people in the world.

917
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,500
And I don't, in fact, I don't think there's any,

918
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:30,500
any man alive who actually can be successful

919
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:36,500
at all these different, huge, diverse disciplines,

920
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,500
such as aviation, such as finance,

921
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,500
such as music, such as trains.

922
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,500
I mean, it, it really takes a lot of knowledge

923
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
to run any one of those.

924
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,500
I can run a company in any one of those industries.

925
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:56,500
And Richard Branson probably knows a lot about the music industry.

926
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,500
And he knows a lot about customers.

927
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,500
And he certainly knows a lot about the virgin brand.

928
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,500
But he's not the brain child.

929
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,500
And he's not operating virgin Atlantic or virgin USA.

930
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:13,500
To even example virgin Atlantic is actually run by Singapore Airlines.

931
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,500
And it's funded by the huge hedge funds, which sit underneath the virgin brand

932
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,500
and contribute money basically by, you know,

933
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,500
these are people who know what they're doing.

934
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,500
So when it comes to bids that virgin does for the national lottery

935
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,500
or for the trains, you know, it's Richard Branson.

936
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:36,500
Have you ever heard the guy say anything that he actually sounds like he knows what he's talking about?

937
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,500
Well, I haven't.

938
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,500
And he was interviewed by the BBC ITV channel for everyone's been interviewing him

939
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,500
all his over in China.

940
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:46,500
And the only thing he can say is, well, I think we have a good bid for Northern Rock.

941
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Because he doesn't actually know.

942
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,500
He doesn't actually know the numbers.

943
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,500
He's not going to run it.

944
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,500
It's not his money.

945
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,500
Of course, he'll make money on it.

946
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,500
It's his brand.

947
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,500
And the feeling is that brand will save all.

948
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,500
Okay, that's well and good.

949
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,500
And of course, it makes a lot of sense because when Richard Branson comes to,

950
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
you know, here's a proper Englishman.

951
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,500
He's a sur.

952
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,500
And he's going to save the bank.

953
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:14,500
But what actually is going to happen, my friends, my fellows, citizens,

954
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:19,500
my fellow countrymen, my fellow residents of the United Kingdom,

955
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,500
is that an I believe Virgin will win the bid.

956
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,500
And they will immediately write out bonds,

957
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,500
which will go to China.

958
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:31,500
Because China is the savior of all at this moment.

959
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,500
They are going to save Northern Rock.

960
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,500
They're going to put billions of dollars,

961
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:42,500
pounds, euros, and yen into Britain in exchange for free trade,

962
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,500
essentially.

963
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,500
Everything's going to be made in China that you find here.

964
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,500
And you're going to see a lot of Chinese run around.

965
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,500
Now, nothing against the Chinese as far as I know.

966
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,500
Because I don't actually know any Chinese people.

967
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,500
But there's a lot of them.

968
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,500
You know, and when you give them the ownership,

969
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,500
then they'll come in and act like owners.

970
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,500
So we've got to be very, very careful about this bond business.

971
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,500
This is actually quite a fallacy because a bond is written,

972
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,500
and a bond is secured.

973
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:20,500
So it's my belief that Virgin will come in with maybe 10 billion pounds.

974
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,500
And we'll work out all kinds of financial ways

975
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:29,500
to basically start a new business with a 10 billion pound investment.

976
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,500
And another 10 to 15 billion will be secured by the state.

977
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,500
And we'll be owners or co-owners or not actually owners of Northern Rock,

978
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,500
but we will be guaranteeing these bonds for many, many years

979
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,500
to come five to 10 years at minimum.

980
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,500
So it's a total scam.

981
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,500
Total scam.

982
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:54,500
And Gordon Brown is just sitting there and coasting through it in plain sight.

983
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:58,500
And he's opening up the floodgates to China.

984
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,500
Which I think I'm not even saying is a bad idea,

985
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:08,500
but I think people need to understand what it could mean.

986
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,500
You know, any foreign ownership by any country.

987
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:16,500
I once read, I'll have to look up the quote and say,

988
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,500
see who said it, but when it comes to global issues,

989
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:27,500
will be us all when we awaken the sleeping giant that is China.

990
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,500
It's going to be an interesting couple of years, my friends.

991
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,500
I wish I was 15 years younger,

992
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,500
and I could be running around, protesting this shit.

993
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,500
I'll do a whole-dent-do-for-add-gile.

994
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,500
All I can do is, all I can do is inspire you with a song.

995
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,500
How about this one?

996
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,500
Come on and join the band.

997
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:06,500
Well, you need us loving and understanding.

998
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,500
Bring the family life, people will know.

999
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,500
This life beyond the share, break, tear.

1000
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,500
Come on and feel it, you know.

1001
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,500
It's coming to all.

1002
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,500
What is all?

1003
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,500
It's coming to all.

1004
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,500
It's coming to all.

1005
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,500
It's coming to all.

1006
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,500
It's coming to all.

1007
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,500
It's coming to all.

1008
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,500
It's coming to all.

1009
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,500
It's coming to all.

1010
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,500
It's coming to all.

1011
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,500
It's coming to all.

1012
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,500
It's coming to all.

1013
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,500
It's coming to all.

1014
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,500
It's coming to all.

1015
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,500
It's coming to all.

1016
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,500
It's coming to all.

1017
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,500
It's coming to all.

1018
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,500
It's coming to all.

1019
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,500
It's coming to all.
