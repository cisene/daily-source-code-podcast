5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,840
I am the root of all evil.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,240
I am the root of your drinking.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
There you go.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,000
So please cautiously listen to the DSC 737 and hey, be careful out there.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:48,160
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,160
The next generation radio content in my ears.

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:58,160
I like to think I'm flying to the future.

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:39,920
Today's message is a solemn warning to all young people who listen to rock and roll and heavy

13
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,160
metal music.

14
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,760
Satan knows he only has a short time to deceive the earth.

15
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:53,760
So it's using music as his anti-trace tool to deceive the masses.

16
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,160
I'm finally beginning to unravel a bizarre and finished plot, designed by Satan's anti-Christ

17
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,160
system to corrupt, revert and ultimately enslave the youth of this generation.

18
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,160
And another one buys the dice.

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,160
Satan's satanic takeover of our youth.

20
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,160
I want to tell you that today, even come at the metal stuff that doesn't sound like

21
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,160
and has anything that could be subjective or even misleading.

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,160
I started asking God, can you show me how we're doing it?

23
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,160
I wanted to have proof positive.

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,160
Wayne has a song called the one buys the dust.

25
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,160
We have the same reaction the first service.

26
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,160
The kids went, oh no, not Queen.

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,160
Not another one buys the dust.

28
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,160
All right, music is dangerous.

29
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,160
Satan has planted his lyrics in the music and some of it is subliminal.

30
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,160
It's down at low decibel levels where you wouldn't hear it audibly.

31
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:08,160
The music at the speed that you or the high sound levels that you would regularly play.

32
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,160
Satan has planted his lyrics in the music.

33
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,160
There's another message going on below the service.

34
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,160
This is called subliminal programming.

35
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
But I want to say something.

36
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,160
I don't believe that this particular asking was intentional.

37
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,160
I think that this is something that Satan himself put into the music.

38
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
Play it forwards.

39
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Another one bites the dust.

40
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,160
Another one bites the dust.

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Another one bites the dust.

42
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:46,160
Another one bites the dust.

43
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,160
Okay, I'm going to play that for you backwards.

44
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,160
The next cassette we have for the new cassette in.

45
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,160
On this next cassette, I want you to hear the secret message.

46
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,160
It's over and over and over.

47
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,160
It's fun.

48
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,160
It's fun.

49
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,160
It's fun.

50
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,160
It's fun.

51
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
It's fun.

52
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
It's fun.

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
It's fun.

54
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
It's fun.

55
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
It's fun.

56
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
Let's play that.

57
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:31,160
You see what the secret message was?

58
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
It's fun.

59
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
It's fun.

60
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
It's fun.

61
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
It's fun.

62
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,160
It's fun.

63
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
It's fun.

64
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,160
I'm going to play that backwards for you once more for those of you that are stuck.

65
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:20,960
Hey man, hey man, do you say lobster dust kicking off the footballer's Friday everybody?

66
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
How did you do win?

67
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,560
This entire program has got to be influenced by this voicemail comment.

68
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,760
Hello, this is Melissa from Southwest Florida.

69
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:37,560
I just had a thought, you know, I really got into the music deal with playing this now yesterday.

70
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,760
I guess I listened to it this morning so I've done yesterday's, I'm going to be able to source code.

71
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,960
I mean, what's really cool?

72
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,560
Have you thought about just putting together and maybe once a week, just putting a podcast together

73
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,760
that just is new and are doing some music for like 30 minutes or so?

74
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,560
I mean, I don't listen to this very much.

75
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
I usually listen to a lot of technical podcasts.

76
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,560
You definitely want to come across a love, you know, a gentle man.

77
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,560
The more you're in a guy with some man, I really came way back when PC mag is small.

78
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
I keep this track.

79
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:18,560
I run here right here with you, not home home, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

80
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
I'll talk to you later.

81
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,760
What a great idea.

82
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,560
You know, I think I've done that before.

83
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,960
It's called full bar Friday.

84
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,360
That's right.

85
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,160
You're in the middle of it.

86
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,960
We're going to bring you a maximum music full bar Friday daily source code.

87
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Episode number 737.

88
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,160
That means music from the soundtrack to my life, heavily influenced by the 80s.

89
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Today, a hit test from Yon Palette, one or two calls, a couple of promos,

90
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
but we're really going to keep the music steaming through.

91
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,760
Here's the first song I played on a radio station ever.

92
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,560
I'll tell you about it after we listen to sound envisioned.

93
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,760
The sound envisioned.

94
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
The sound envisioned.

95
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,160
No, no, let's take a look.

96
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,160
It's the color of my room.

97
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,760
Where I will live.

98
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
You're good.

99
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,160
You're fine, you're on a land.

100
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,160
You're just a night.

101
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
You're good.

102
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,160
I'm a little sick right now, waiting for you for the sound envisioned.

103
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Nothing until my stomach beat.

104
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Don't you wonder sometimes.

105
00:07:51,160 --> 00:08:00,160
But not only was that the first 45 RPM single I ever owned.

106
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
But it's not that loud.

107
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,160
But it's not that loud.

108
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Not only was it the first 45 RPM single I ever owned.

109
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,160
It was indeed the first song I ever played on a radio station ever, of course the radio station was one that I built myself.

110
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,160
I built it.

111
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Oh man, I built it all by hand and then had my mom drive me around the block to see how far my signal would reach and I just played this song over and over.

112
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,160
And that was it. David Bowie sounded vision.

113
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Food bar Friday, hey everybody, my name's Adam Curry and I'm here to do nothing but entertain you today.

114
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
Jesus!

115
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Jesus!

116
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,160
What the heck are you?

117
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Hi Adam, it's Matt from Gamesweasel on this week's show.

118
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,160
We show two soldiers a better than one with army of two.

119
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
We also try out no more heroes on the Wii.

120
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,160
I've got a fantastic preview of Far Cry 2, a hands-on demo in fact,

121
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,160
and you can be in copies of Kendem 2 for the PS3,

122
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
along with some funky t-shirts.

123
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,160
That's all at Gamesweasel.com.

124
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Oh man, this is taking me back in time.

125
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Let me see about 30 years.

126
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Where were you when you first heard this song by the Dooby Brothers?

127
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,160
What a full belief on the Charlie on the football Friday.

128
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,160
We've never come in there when you wanted to say,

129
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Oh, it's a real life.

130
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,160
We've never really was to say,

131
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,160
I had a place in his life.

132
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:06,160
He never meant nothing was.

133
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
As he rises through,

134
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,160
I'll follow you.

135
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,160
And everybody else will surely know.

136
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,160
As long as you're right now,

137
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,160
I've got a full belief.

138
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:31,160
He's seen the wise man has the power.

139
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,160
To reason the way.

140
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:43,160
The way I said I've just realized.

141
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:55,160
The way I had the power is what I had to say

142
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,160
The way I had to hear what악.

143
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,160
It started and ended

144
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:31,160
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why, I

145
00:11:31,160 --> 00:12:01,160
don't know why, I don't know what, I don't know, why,

146
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:13,680
For the Christmas Christmas26

147
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,520
Once upon a time.

148
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,520
Michael McDonald, did we rather as what a full release?

149
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:29,520
Of course, I'll play it under the educational auspices of the organization for the preservation of the soundtrack of our lives.

150
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,520
We all contribute to that soundtrack, but we each have individual and probably quite different line or notes.

151
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,520
I don't even remember this song so much about the first time I heard it.

152
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:45,520
It always reminds me of the Daddy of the Ratio, one of my big idols in radio, his name is Big Bad Al,

153
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Alfred LaHarda, who passed away.

154
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Oh, man, must be about 10 years ago now.

155
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,520
Well, we learned so much from him, and he was always hanging out with the Dooby Brothers,

156
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,520
always going off to Santa Monica, wherever they were recording,

157
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,520
and he had some awesome, awesome outtakes and just some great live stuff.

158
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,520
And I always have to think of him when I play what a full-believes.

159
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,520
So, I had a whole bunch of stuff that I was thinking about talking about today.

160
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,520
Yesterday I saw Richard Blustein's eclectic news brief number 46,

161
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,520
so it's the Iraq War Special.

162
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
I was like, wow, man.

163
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
I should probably talk about that.

164
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
It was really moving.

165
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,520
And then I thought, you know, maybe I should ask people to explain what's going on in Tibet.

166
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,520
And then the rumor girls saw them as well yesterday.

167
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,520
They had a special about menopause.

168
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
Not to myself.

169
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
I know.

170
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,520
I'll just keep it straight up, saw straight Charlie with them.

171
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,520
Oh, a little bit of messed up stuff thrown in, just to mix it up a bit.

172
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:47,520
Peace of Palace, Gary.

173
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
Do you have 30 minutes towards free?

174
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
This is Mary.

175
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
May I take your order?

176
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Hi.

177
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
Mary.

178
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Yes, I'd like to the order.

179
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,520
Is this Mr. Kelly?

180
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Yes.

181
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
Thank you for calling again, sir.

182
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:02,520
I'm sure your national identification number is 6102049998-45-54610.

183
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
Is that correct?

184
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Yes.

185
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Thank you, Mr. Kelly.

186
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,520
I see you with a 736 Montrose Corb, which you're calling for yourself on.

187
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Are you at home?

188
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
I'm just leaving work, but I'm...

189
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,520
Oh, we can deliver to Bob's out of supply.

190
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,520
That's a 1, 7, 5 Lincoln Avenue, yes?

191
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
No.

192
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
I'm on my way home.

193
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
How do you know all this stuff?

194
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
We just got wired into this system, sir.

195
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Oh.

196
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,520
Well, I'd like to order a couple of your double meat special pizzas.

197
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Sure thing.

198
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,520
There'll be a new 20L charge for this, sir.

199
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,520
What do you mean?

200
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,520
So, the system shows me that your medical records indicate that you have high blood pressure

201
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
and extremely high cholesterol.

202
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Luckily, we have a new agreement with your national health care providers that allows us to

203
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,520
double meat pies while I'm sure agreed away of all future plans to buy a billet.

204
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
What?

205
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Do you agree, sir?

206
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
You can sign the form when we deliver, but there is a charge for processing.

207
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
The total of $67.

208
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,520
$37.

209
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,520
That includes the delivery search charge of $15 to cover the address to our driver of traveling through

210
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
an orange zone.

211
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
I live in an orange zone?

212
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
No, you do.

213
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,520
Looks like there was another robbery on Montrose yesterday.

214
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
Hmm.

215
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
You could say $48.

216
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,520
If you ordered our special front submarine combo picked out yourself.

217
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,520
Comes with tofu sticks that are very tasty, sir.

218
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Good value, too.

219
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,520
But I want double meat.

220
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,520
Well, I'm sure you can afford the $67.

221
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
You just bought those tickets for Hawaii.

222
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
They weren't cheap, eh?

223
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Oh.

224
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,520
But I see you checked out the budget beach on the library last week.

225
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Hmm.

226
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Up to you, sir.

227
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
All right.

228
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
All right.

229
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
I'll get the sprouts, sir.

230
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Good choice, sir.

231
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Got to watch that way, sir.

232
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,520
You're hitting the beach, ain't it?

233
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
42 inches.

234
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Wow.

235
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,520
And I'd say tofu and sprouts is like required.

236
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
That's so much.

237
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Just between you and me.

238
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,520
There's a $3 off coupon in this one.

239
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
Total men's fitness magazine.

240
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Your wife, Betty, subscribe to that, right?

241
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
Anyhow.

242
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
Put that in its 1999 even.

243
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,520
Whoa.

244
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Looks like you maxed out on all your credit cards.

245
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
Bring cash, okay?

246
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Got to get credit, sauce.

247
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
I don't go in.

248
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Your honor.

249
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,520
I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out.

250
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
Your honor.

251
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,520
Please don't bang that gavel.

252
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,520
You can try this cowbell out.

253
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Let's don't give a nod.

254
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,520
To the hardest work in law here.

255
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
It's jersey time.

256
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,520
Yeah.

257
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,520
It's jersey time.

258
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,520
Oh yeah.

259
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,520
Your honor.

260
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,520
What do you say?

261
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Yeah.

262
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
Oh yeah.

263
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,520

264
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
Oh yeah.

265
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
How's it going, Adam?

266
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
It's jersey time.

268
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Dude.

269
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
Dude.

270
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
We've been in this game long enough.

271
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
We know exactly what's going on.

272
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,520
And today we have to respect our history.

273
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:02,520
The band allowed posting the song called Beaches up on the PMman on April 4th 2006.

274
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,520
It's one of the all-time greatest tracks ever posted to the PMman.

275
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,520
In fact, it's one of the songs that inspired me to become a podcaster.

276
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,520
Well, that band is back on the positive music network with a brand, a spanking new album.

277
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,520
And I got to tell you, I love it a lot.

278
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
The band is allowed.

279
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,520
They're out of Boston, Massachusetts, Gen D. Lowe, San Henry Bergstein.

280
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
The share the lead vocals.

281
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
They're a fantastic pot-safe band.

282
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
And I know you're going to dig this track.

283
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520

284
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520

You're for more Friday.

288
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Crank it up.

289
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,520
It's burning in my belly.

290
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
And I want it at my head.

291
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,520
I'll read the rate before I can use it.

292
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,520
It's the best thing going up there.

293
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,520
You don't want to get worse in the coming days.

294
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,520
I might as well say what I would need to say.

295
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,520

392
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
You've started a new campaign with EMUZIC.com.

393
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,520
If you never say a lot of people know about EMUZIC because you can get free and clear, DRM free, MP3s.

394
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
You can purchase from EMUZIC.

We've got a lot of great offers.

396
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
I think we have the best one around.

397
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
35 free songs.

398
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Absolutely no obligation.

399
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,520
You're used to keep using my checkout code or just go directly to the URL, which I'll also put in the show notes.

400
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
DailySourceCode.com, I'm sorry.

401
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
EMUZIC.com slash daily source code.

402
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,520
Hey, Adam, a tower green scene from New York.

403
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,520
I'm noticing a big lag between the time that your podcast is listed at hurried.com.

404
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,520
And the time that iTunes decides that it's available for me to download it.

405
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,520
A couple of hours actually.

406
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Sorry, the iPhone is making the wire in duck there.

407
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
Sorry about that.

408
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
So what's the story there?

409
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,520
Why is Potsho taking such a long time to let iTunes feed note in its published?

410
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
Is it an iTunes problem or a Potsho problem?

411
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Please let me know.

412
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,520
Especially in a couple of hours lag here.

413
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Yeah, yeah.

414
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
How are you?

415
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
I'm fine.

416
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
I'm fine.

417
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,520
Yes, that is an iTunes problem.

418
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,520
Although it could be spurned and spawned by a Potsho problem.

419
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:41,520
When we released V2.5, apparently a number of actually all the show sites that have a domain name maps to it.

420
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,520
So for instance, I have dailySourceCode.com mapped to my show page at Potsho.

421
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,520
So there's also a URL for the RSS feed dailySourceCode.com slash RSS.xml.

422
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,520
I think it is or feed.xml, whatever.

423
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,520
That apparently got misconfigured in the push with the new site.

424
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,520
So that was down for about a day and a half.

425
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,520
And so iTunes, I guess they have to catch up.

426
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,520
I'm not quite sure what happens.

427
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,520
So my feed wasn't available for at least a full 24 hours.

428
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,520
And they're catching up, but we publish immediately.

429
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
So I guess they're just slow.

430
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,520
Mind you, it's a big deal to be out there looking at all these feeds and aggregating them.

431
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,520
How do I know?

432
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,520
Let me see.

433
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,520
Because we do it too.

434
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,520
Hey Adam, this is another hit test and we're going to start right away with intro number one.

435
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Bring it on.

436
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Please, y'all.

437
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,520
That of course is a Harold Fultimire and Axel F from Beverly Hills Cop.

438
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
That was pretty easy.

439
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
Number two.

440
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,520
It sounds like Donna Summer, I feel love maybe.

441
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,520
And intro number three.

442
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
Adam.

443
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,520
I don't push any further.

444
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Don't look any further.

445
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
Luther Vandros, for sure.

446
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,520
I think it's don't look any further.

447
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
Yeah, that's the thing.

448
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
And these are the answers.

449
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,520
Yeah.

450
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Answer number one is from 1985.

451
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,520
This is Axel F by Harold Fultimire.

452
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,520
We're also known as that crazy frog song.

453
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
Only this is the original kid.

454
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,520
This is what you should be using as a ringtone on your mobile.

455
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,520
Can you believe your daddy actually thought this was a great song back in a day?

456
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
Axel F, Harold Fultimire.

457
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
Answer number one.

458
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
And now what was number two?

459
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,520
And this is answer number two from 1986.

460
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
What's this?

461
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,520
Oh, it's not a total lie.

462
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,520
That sounds like Luther.

463
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
That sounds like Luther.

464
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
That's how it was.

465
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,520
Give me the reason Luther Vandros has answered number two.

466
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
What is number three?

467
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,520
And this is number three.

468
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,520
From 1987, this is don't look any further.

469
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Right, but it was a bite.

470
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,520
I'm going to take credit for Luther some time.

471
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
Let'suggish again.

472
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,520
Is there no way?

473
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,520
Max, you guys are blind, are you looking for us?

474
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,520
An incredible difference, listen to what I did.

475
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
What I did?

476
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
What was it, Sean?

477
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,520
I think I said that's what...

478
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,520
I have to ask for thepersa arkadaş in the works we need to do.

479
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,520
And that concludes hit dance.

480
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,520
We're number 114.

481
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,520
Well, so Adam, how did you do this time?

482
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,520
Well, kind of shitty.

483
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,520
I'd say 1.75 stars today.

484
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,520
You want to know the answers for this hit test?

485
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,520
You can find them at hittest.bossio.com.

486
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:39,520
And the links to iTunes you can buy distract online are there to be found as well.

487
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
Alrighty, Adam, thank you for playing.

488
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
Everyone else, thank you for listening.

489
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,520
Next week, I'll be back for 115.

490
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,520
It's been until then.

491
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
Take care.

492
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
I'll be back.

493
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
Hittest.bgmail.com.

494
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
info.

495
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
Yon Polet.com.

496
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
J&BOLT.com.

497
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
J&BOLT.com.

498
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,520
It is the maximum music from our Friday.

499
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,520
This is pretty easily been part of Young's Hittest.

500
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,520
Now people who are...

501
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,520
Well, you still listen to me on Radio Despawn Amsterdam.

502
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:15,520
We'll certainly recognize this song.

503
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
I'm not even going to give you a hint.

504
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:23,520
I'll just tell you the BB and Q band Brooklyn Bronx and Queens band on the beat.

505
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,520
I think this is the 12 inch maxi single version.

506
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,520
I may cut it short.

507
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,520
Stand by.

508
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,520
I'll be back.

509
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,520
I'll be back.

510
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
I'll be back.

511
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520
I'll be back.

512
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,520
I'll be back.

513
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
I'll be back.

514
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
I'll be back.

515
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
I'll be back.

516
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,520
I'll be back.

517
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520

Today's source code concerns that doesn't have line going ahead.

636
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,520
I had a bit steep in San Francisco.

637
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:14,520
You were talking with a fuel about identifying future criminals by DNA.

638
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,520
I planned what's against San Francisco accurately predicts the future.

639
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Have you seen the minority report?

640
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,520
It's the steelberg movie?

641
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
Years ago?

642
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,520
Better yet, have you read?

643
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
Is this your story?

644
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Is it a space on?

645
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
I felt a dick.

646
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
It's precisely about this issue.

647
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
I can make it up.

648
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520

Are you ready for that?

651
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
Is it a big opportunity?

652
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,520
I'll make it enough.

653
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,520
It's where we call to meet.

654
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,520
How much of your belief is he made?

655
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,520
Oh, say that you hope for me.

656
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
Take it out.

657
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,520
Somewhere between this measure.

658
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,520
I know that I don't know.

659
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
From what I heard them say.

660
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,520
No music that they play.

661
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,520
It's nothing like it ever hurt for.

662
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,520
Once you get the dance, it's not your belief.

663
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
Because I'll really don't keep you tight.

664
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,520
What do you say now?

665
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,520
I'll make it enough.

666
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
It's a big opportunity.

667
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
I'll make it enough.

668
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
Instead of saying, let it be.

669
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
How much of your belief is he made?

670
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
I'll make it enough.

671
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
It's where we call to meet.

672
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,520
Everybody's dancing.

673
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,520
Everybody's on the beat.

674
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
Are you ready for that?

675
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,520
Is it a big opportunity?

676
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,520
Everybody's dancing.

677
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Everybody's on the beat.

678
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
Are you ready for that?

679
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,520
Is it a big opportunity?

680
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,520
Everybody's dancing.

681
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Everybody's on the beat.

682
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,520
How much of your belief is he made?

683
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
Everybody's on the beat.

684
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
Everybody's on the beat.

685
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520

00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,520
And what kind of things might happen?

689
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,520
You're breaking up here, isn't it?

690
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,520
I know.

691
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,520
Like, I don't even know the really song that I'm going to come up.

692
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,520
Okay.

693
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:37,520

00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,520

707
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520

708
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,520
eye-cone suits,

709
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,520
three tones,

710
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
full phone.

711
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,520
Yeser tickets,

712
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520

713
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520

What's the guarantee?

715
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520

716
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520

720
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,520
just a nod shall we,

721
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,520
with some esoteric shit

722
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
from the soundtrack to my life.

723
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,520
Michael Franks,

724
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,520
when Slicals.

725
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,520
When Slicals.

726
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
The Prophet speaks

727
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
when Slicals.

728
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,520
The secret leagues,

729
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,520
the sky and falls.

730
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,520
The day has stopped.

731
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
The war is won.

732
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,520
The battle is lost.

733
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,520
When Slicals.

734
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,520
It's their team takes.

735
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,520
When Slicals.

736
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,520
The summer breaks.

737
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,520
The sky and falls.

738
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,520
The rain begins.

739
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,520
At the last.

740
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Some of the unspins.

741
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,520
Two inside.

742
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,520
From the icy aftersharp.

743
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,520
I've heard each turn.

744
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,520
Let's fly home.

745
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,520
Right.

746
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
You watched that phone with a set phone.

747
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,520
You watched that phone with a set phone.

748
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,520
You watched that phone with a set phone.

749
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,520
You watched that phone with a set phone.

750
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,520
You watched that phone with a set phone.

751
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,520
You watched that phone with a set phone.

752
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,520
You watched that phone with a set phone.

753
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
You watched that phone with a set phone.

754
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,520
You watched that phone with a set phone.

755
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,520
You watched that phone with a set phone.

756
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:58,520
For me, you hear this worked with Dad that team.

757
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:28,520
When you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're

758
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:58,520
when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, you're the only one you've seen here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you're here, when you

759
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,520
The past laid lands, the sky falls

760
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,520
The single beats, I laugh, no doubt

761
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,520
And shine my shades, and contemplate the crystal blue

762
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,520
From will you fuck, I'm plunged into, where it's like all

763
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,520
Oh, ya.

764
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:40,520
Only this one is death

765
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,520
I am laughier, I am making my escape

766
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,520
And I thought it was that full of love that was that full of love

767
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,520
And here we are, that's my good time to keep

768
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:59,520
It's that full of love that's that full of love that's that full of love

769
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,520
Look how it's out, it's that full of love that's me

770
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,520
And I thought it was that full of love that was that full of love

771
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,520
And I thought it was that full of love that was that full of love

772
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:25,520
When you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear the beat

773
00:37:43,520 --> 00:38:13,520
And you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear

774
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:21,140
that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, when you hear that, the sound of the sound again.

775
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,620
I'm trying to think, I believe the album was popsicle-toes.

776
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,220
Certainly, that was a track on the album.

777
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,480
Michael Franks went SLies Calls.

778
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,360
This is the song that we used back in a day of the Pio치 radio station to evaluate the sound of the station

779
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,920
Doesn't really pump into the compressor, you know, you know what my sound is today, right?

780
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:49,040
It's it's definitely a throwback to early 80s mayonnaise FM sound. I love it. I'm a part of the whole mix

781
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,000
If you don't like it, well, top you're stuck with it

782
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:01,240
Oh, boy, so good to hear those songs on the soundtrack to my life. What day is it today? It's Friday

783
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,960
Well, just about time to wrap it up as we've moved past the 30 minutes

784
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,360
I kind of promised to do today, but a lot of fun just jamming out to these songs

785
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,880

788
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,960
Final thought of the week. You know, we've been talking a lot about conspiracies the government DNA cameras

789
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:46,440
Being watched big brother three strikes your out. Can I just remind us all that it is extremely

790
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:52,920
Important and you can change this at any moment no matter what's bothering you no matter if you're worried about the future

791
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,320
If you're worried about the economy the government in your head you can

792
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,400
Create happiness in one second. That's all it takes one second. Listen very close to the sound of my voice

793
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,040
All you have to do is live your life with passion

794
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,520
All right one last song and while you're thinking about how to live with your life with passion

795
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,680
And why do listen closely to this song

796
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:29,720
Because the words will tell you what love is really about brought to you by Chaka Khan. It's through the fire body

797
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,400
And that's the day and you see

798
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,920
You're not a trust in your heart to anyone

799
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,520
You tell me you're gonna play it smart

800
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,360
We're through before we start

801
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,800
Whatever that we've all been just for fun

802
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:03,400
When it's this good there's no

803
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,720
I want you so

804
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:19,480
High

805
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,760
For

806
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,800
But I'm not alone

807
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Watch out that I know

808
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,800
I take it away

809
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,800
And climb down to the wall

810
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,800
Even through the wild

811
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:58,800
I know you're afraid of what you feel

812
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,800
It's still any time to feel

813
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,800
And I'm alone and let me drive

814
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,800
You took me and something new

815
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,800
And I can't even do

816
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:23,800
I'm not living just isn't that pretty goodbye

817
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:31,800
Where does this mean that knows I know

818
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,800
I need you so I'm ready to go

819
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,800
To limit to the wall

820
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,800
Watch out that I know

821
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,800
I can limit to the wall

822
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:57,800
To limit to the wall

823
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,800
Watch out that I know

824
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,800
I take it away

825
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,800
And climb down to the wall

826
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,800
Even through the wild

827
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,800
Even through the wild

828
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,800
Watch out that I know

829
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,800
I can limit to the wall

830
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,800
To limit to the wall

831
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,800
Watch out that I know

832
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,800
I can limit to the wall

833
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,800
I know you're afraid of what you feel

834
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,800
It's still any time to feel

835
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,800
And I can limit to the wall

836
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,800
To limit to the wall

837
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,800
To limit to the wall

838
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
To limit to the wall

839
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,800
To limit to the wall

840
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,800
To limit to the wall

841
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,800
I am

842
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,800
Chuck a car

843
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,800
Through the fire

844
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,800
There's more than I'm every woman

845
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,800
Chuck Chuck a car

846
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
I am ready

847
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,800
Wow

848
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
I've had a great time

849
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,800
I hope you guys have enjoyed it

850
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
Because it was all about music that

851
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,800
Related to me

852
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,800
So I hope you had some fun

853
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,800
Great way to wrap up

854
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
The week has been a long week

855
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,800
Got a weekend ahead

856
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,800
It's a bank holiday here in the UK

857
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,800
So that means we can even chill out

858
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,800
A little bit on Monday

859
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,800
Or at least everyone else can

860
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,800
I'm sure the San Francisco office will have something for me to do on Monday

861
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,800
So have a great weekend

862
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,800
If you're listening to this during the weekend

863
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,800
Or maybe you're just starting the week out

864
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,800
And want to kick on a Monday if you're down under

865
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,800
