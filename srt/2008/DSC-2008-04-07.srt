Delta Sierra Charley, 744.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,840
In Britain, Vicki Barker reports on what the British are calling a national curry crisis.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:20,040
Britain's very love affair with Curry is under threat.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,520
He says peace thinking of relocating to New York.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,000
For NPR News, I'm Vicki Barker in London.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
With this, this is the daily source code, the daily source code.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
For $16 million worth of airplane strapped by us, in the next generation radio content in my years.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We don't need lost deep dreams in.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I like to think I'm flying into this journey.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm guessing he's very clean.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Do you know just how bad I want to get to you?

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Just so I can talk to you, I think all they're in school.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh my mind, every day I think about you all night.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You got me going crazy, baby, do you know what that's like?

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Baby, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh my mind, every day I think about you all night.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Baby, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh my mind, every day I think about you all night.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh my mind, every day I think about you all night.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh my mind, every day I think about you all night.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Did you even notice me?

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I wore this dress for you.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I found out where you were tonight, so I could be here too.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I love it when you look at me.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I think I called your eye.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Wanna see what's on my mind?

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Baby, I'm not sorry.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Baby, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Wanna see what's in your mind?

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Baby, I'm not sorry.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Baby, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it every day.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm going to be like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,600
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,560
from the affluent suburb of Surrey,

35
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,600
known as Gilford, we're on the west side of G-Town.

36
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,240
In the manner up in the top,

37
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,640
you may hear a little bit different acoustics today,

38
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,440
as I spend some time over the weekend,

39
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
clean the entire joint up up here.

40
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,800
I actually should take a picture of this

41
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,840
because I've really set it up nicely.

42
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,400
I got really tired.

43
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,920
I'm using everything my MacBook Pro now

44
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,760
is used almost exclusively for everything I do,

45
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,160
but also for all of my DSE and no agenda audio production.

46
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,240
I got kind of tired of picking it up,

47
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
preparing stuff behind one desk

48
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,360
and then unplugging everything,

49
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,680
then moving the Mac over to the other workstation.

50
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,400
So what I've done now is I've set up the secondary workstation

51
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,880
as a complete editing, it's all clean, dedicated thing,

52
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,120
and I've set up my big cinema monitor,

53
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,600
cinema display on the desk,

54
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,760
and I've got my, I've got my controls,

55
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,040
and I've got my microphone,

56
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,880
everything else set up.

57
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,200
So I don't actually have to move anymore.

58
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,640
I can just kind of prep the show,

59
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,120
and then before you know what I can roll into,

60
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,840
I'll have to do is move the microphone over,

61
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
and I think it's working,

62
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,360
but because the mic is directed in a different angle,

63
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,040
you'll probably hear some different sounds

64
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,680
that you can pick up since we have everything,

65
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,040
but a soundproof booth.

66
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,240
Once again, streaming live on 365.com

67
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,480
with varying results for everybody,

68
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,640
that's really pissing me off.

69
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,160
For some reason, it's just not working.

70
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,560
People go to the play page, the station page,

71
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,800
it doesn't refresh, or even if you refresh,

72
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,080
it doesn't say the station is on air.

73
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,720
I've handed out dot PLS files,

74
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,440
and those expire after a certain amount of time,

75
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,040
it should be a hell of a lot easier.

76
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,120
What I have done though is I've changed the bitrate

77
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,320
from I was basically sending out

78
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,480
to 128 kilobit streaming bitrate.

79
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,960
I've lowered that to 96,

80
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,320
so that should make a lot of difference

81
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,600
to everybody out there.

82
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,920
Hey Adam, this is Kevin and Dallas Texas.

83
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,160
Hey, a long time listener,

84
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,040
man, I had a question.

85
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,240
I noticed today that episode of 128 live.

86
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,320
And I hadn't listened to yet, but I'm about to.

87
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,840
And I was just wondering if there's any plans

88
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,480
for pod showed, implement any kind of live streaming,

89
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,000
like you're doing with a live 365.

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,720
Just curious.

91
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,520
I love the show, no one will love you.

92
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,360
Hope you win, love your hair, all that good stuff.

93
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,520
Yeah, yeah, excellent.

94
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,360
I'll wait a bit.

95
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,160
No, I'll tell you, when's back at you, my brother?

96
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,520
Yeah, so just let me explain that,

97
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,080
because I also heard some people over the weekend

98
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,120
talking about the validity of doing something live.

99
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,120
It has nothing to do with a replacement of the show.

100
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,560
In fact, I'm just recording the show

101
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,640
as if I normally would, but it adds two dimensions.

102
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,000
Actually, one, it does not add.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,200
It does not add a humongous additional audience

104
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,880
because it's kind of, you know,

105
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,960
look, I'm not setting this thing up at a schedule.

106
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,160
I'm waiting until I think, you know, San Francisco

107
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,480
and New York are more or less up.

108
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,800
Europe is available, but it may be a bad time in the afternoon.

109
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,320
I mean, there's no good time for any agreement

110
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,840
because the show is of such a global nature.

111
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,400
But what it does give me, it gives me the feedback loop.

112
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,960
That, you know, there isn't audience out there.

113
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,800
Of course, I've got my phone calls

114
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,360
and the pre-prepared bits that you guys send in.

115
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,280
But to actually have some feedback coming in

116
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,520
and I'm using Twitter and I don't want to chat room

117
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,120
at least not right now.

118
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,600
I really like the whole idea of, you know,

119
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,840
like a two or three minute delay before, you know,

120
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,760
people send something to me or do the outside,

121
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,200
Adam Curry on Twitter for me to, you know, pick up

122
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,080
on whatever comment they have.

123
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
And for some reason that timing just works,

124
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,960
so I'm gonna leave it that way.

125
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,680
But as nothing to do with, you know,

126
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,400
live radio or replacement of the podcast,

127
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
that's just an enhancement.

128
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
And as long as we get it working perfectly,

129
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,480
by the way, you know, I spend like 99 bucks a month for this.

130
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,240
And they just make it incredibly difficult

131
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,760
for people to get into it, which pisses me off.

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,720
Ah, very big day today.

133
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,520
My lovely bride of,

134
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,000
to all what is now 21, 22 years.

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,080
The Lady Patricia celebrates her birthday today.

136
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Big deal.

137
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,120
The Dutch are always big on birthdays.

138
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,960
And it starts off, and I've said this many times before,

139
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,480
but it starts off the minute you wake up.

140
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,120
In fact, back in the day, I don't know if they still do that.

141
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,000
It would be quite traditional for families

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,800
to decorate the kitchen and decorate the birthday,

143
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,160
boy or girl's chair and hang up balloons.

144
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,480
And kind of make a celebration all day.

145
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,240
And in the evening, you know, family from far and wide

146
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,880
will stop by and we'll all have coffee

147
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,880
and sit in a circle and talk about doctors appointments.

148
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,400
And, well, not just doctors appointments.

149
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,960
We'll talk about the economy at large.

150
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,280
You know, kind of like this show, actually.

151
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,240
So lots of SMS text messages, lots of phone calls,

152
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,040
flowers showing up at the door.

153
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,760
And of course, I gave my present, which I give every single year.

154
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,120
She is allowed to take a full expenses trip

155
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,760
with her sister anywhere in the world.

156
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,520
I think they've chosen Venice this time.

157
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,760
And it's just the two of them,

158
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,680
and they go away for like three or four days.

159
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,400
They've done different locations.

160
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,800
They've gone to the sun a couple times,

161
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,200
but they'd really like to do kind of a chick thing.

162
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,360
So, quite happy that they're gonna go, go to Venice

163
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,240
and enjoy themselves.

164
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,640
Over the weekend, it's been a interesting week

165
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,520
from my wallet.

166
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,120
I just couldn't get around it under it

167
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,640
or past it anymore.

168
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,360
Christina needs to have a car.

169
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,040
Her test is coming up in two weeks.

170
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,040
And I promised I said, Dad, we'll get some for you know.

171
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,200
I even offered her the jag.

172
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,360
I said, look, I don't drive this thing.

173
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,200
Why don't she use it?

174
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,320
And for the one time a month, I need a car,

175
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,160
I'll borrow it or I'll do whatever.

176
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,920
Of course, that was no good.

177
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,120
And she'd been watching these commercial.

178
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,120
If you'd seen it here in the UK, it's for the Renault Clio.

179
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,520
It's pretty funny commercial, actually,

180
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,520
where there's like one of those tours of the stars,

181
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,160
buses is going through what I guess

182
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,400
it's supposed to look like Beverly Hills.

183
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,120
And so the tour guide says,

184
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,560
now look at all these wonderful homes,

185
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,720
the rich and famous live here

186
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,800
and look at all these beautiful cars they have.

187
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,960
And it's like, it's like 830 in the morning

188
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,800
or whatever.

189
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,520
You see everyone rolling out humurs and porches

190
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,440
and Ferrari's.

191
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,720
And then when the bus is the gone,

192
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,440
then one of the neighborhood inhabitants

193
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,880
calls the rest on his phone, he says,

194
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,160
okay, they're gone, we're all clear.

195
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,680
And everyone puts their expensive car back

196
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,360
in the garage and they all roll out their Renault Clio's,

197
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,400
which is kind of funny.

198
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,160
And it had some great offer,

199
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,520
like you get a Tom Tom Go Navigator.

200
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,320
They even, and I was actually quite excited about this.

201
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,560
I thought this is perfect.

202
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,720
The help my daughter understand how credit works

203
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
and how fucked up it is when you have to pay

204
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,600
the 99 pounds every single month

205
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,720
to keep your car just in your possession.

206
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,480
Like, obviously that hooker up with down payment

207
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,040
and all of that stuff.

208
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,800
But yeah, she should work for some of it,

209
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,560
at least some of the keeping it on the roadbits.

210
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,760
And well, that offers no longer valid.

211
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,480
That was only up until March 31st.

212
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,400
In fact, they stopped making the car all together.

213
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,800
So we looked at a couple others and I like these Renault's.

214
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,920
You know, they're kind of cute.

215
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,280
And then they saw a Renault Twingo,

216
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,720
which I've heard about,

217
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,200
I think it's just been introduced into Britain.

218
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,800
But it's been on the road in Europe, I know for sure.

219
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,440
And it was actually the cheapest car there

220
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,000
that the girls fell in love with it.

221
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,440
It's a very, very girly car.

222
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,880
And of course, the biggest feature of the Twingo

223
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,840
is that there's a connector for not just your iPod.

224
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,880
It also has a general audio connector

225
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,000
for any generic MP3 player.

226
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,120
And it has, and this was pretty cool.

227
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,560
It has a USB port.

228
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,800
So you can plug in a memory stick.

229
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,720
You know, just slap some songs on to your memory stick

230
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,360
and you can control the memory stick

231
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,240
or at least you can surf through the directories,

232
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,320
I guess, right there.

233
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,320
On the onboard sound system.

234
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,600
So anyway, so that should be shown up in a week or two.

235
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,600
And I'm Mr. Hero, can I say?

236
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,240
Let me see, what's going on?

237
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,960
A couple of bits of feedback from you guys.

238
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,520
Oh, we got a couple of sub-onts

239
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,440
and sub-onts in training, coming up.

240
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,840
And this was interesting.

241
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,560
This was, I kind of like this,

242
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,120
because whenever people try to figure out

243
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,160
why they listen to this show or why they listen

244
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,880
to any particular podcast in general,

245
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,320
it's always interesting to hear them struggling

246
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,120
to come up with a reason.

247
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,360
And I don't actually know if I know why it works either,

248
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,560
but I do know that no agenda is quickly building up

249
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,680
a massive audience.

250
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,560
This is the show that I do once a week with John Cedar-Vorac.

251
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,160
And in fact, the audience is coming pretty close

252
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,640
to rivaling the daily source code.

253
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,280
It just went incredibly fast.

254
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Now, I know that a lot of that is coming through,

255
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,280
you know, DeVorac's circle of fans and listeners

256
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,760
and detractors, I'm sure, lots of them checking it as well.

257
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,640
But it's always fun to listen to people trying to figure out

258
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,480
why they listen to a show like no agenda

259
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,680
or the daily source code.

260
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,080
Yeah, it's gross from washing couldn't.

261
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,400
And this was named to your Monday, DSC.

262
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,600
And that's a reason that you'll know you'll go

263
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,640
in episode that, definitely a beautiful thing

264
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,640
that YouTube has viewing John Cedar-Vorac on a no agenda.

265
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,680
Start listening to about two weeks ago

266
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,600
on the kind of gun off my ass.

267
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,400
And I noticed that people go back and listen

268
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,680
to all the original episodes.

269
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,240
We're only up in number 25 so far.

270
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,840
But people really turn in hand.

271
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,640
People, I mean, like, you people, you know, you folks.

272
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,560
But one thing I kind of wondered was,

273
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,360
why don't you even listen to either of you,

274
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,800
especially you, I mean, I've been listening to you

275
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,960
for six months now.

276
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,560
And I'm not really a big talk soul listener,

277
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,000
listen up on the radio.

278
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,400
And just along this time, you know,

279
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,440
I even bought my iPods,

280
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,200
only for the habit, like to have all my musical in place.

281
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,440
I had to have to listen to a bunch of blowharts

282
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,320
on the radio, planned, you know,

283
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,040
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

284
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,640
listen to commercials.

285
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
And I don't know.

286
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,800
Maybe that's what you are, a blow-hard.

287
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,320
Well, I can't, I'll listen to it all the way through

288
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
and be like, dude, it's just great.

289
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,600
I don't know, it's like a big mystery, maybe.

290
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,960
You know, that's not what you're here.

291
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,240
No, no, that is a real good point.

292
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,960
I believe that the interactivity of podcasting

293
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,080
is much bigger than anyone gives it credit for,

294
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,040
because of course, what everybody does.

295
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,200
When you listen to a show,

296
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,680
and it doesn't matter how long it is or how short,

297
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,280
you ultimately have the control

298
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,440
whether you're going to listen to it,

299
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,000
whether you're going to skip over certain bits.

300
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,640
I know lots of people skip through the music on this show.

301
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,520
I think that's a big part of it.

302
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,560
And by the way, that's not just for independently produce shows

303
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,680
like this one that goes for NPR shows as well.

304
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,760
You know, that's a big deal.

305
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,360
We don't really think about how incredibly cool it is

306
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,120
that you can skip ahead in your favorite radio show.

307
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,320
I don't know, because I saw you on Cranky Geeks

308
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,320
and kids say that your hair was doing all that good.

309
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
That's being said, you and the horror

310
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,320
looks like twins, but I'm like a 10-year delay.

311
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
You know, make that 20.

312
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Twenty-four years old, single, like male,

313
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
go into school here at UWT.

314
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
They're here, hope you win.

315
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,320
Love you, meme it, and bye-bye.

316
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
Yeah, you know, ma'am.

317
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Thank you very much.

318
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,320
Yeah, that's a good observation.

319
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Before I can hire like evil twins separated by not 10,

320
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
but by 20 years, he celebrated his birthday on Saturday,

321
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
by the way, didn't want anyone to know.

322
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
And I also know his real age,

323
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
which I don't think he wants anyone to know either,

324
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
but a happy belated birthday.

325
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,320
I was talking to a couple of people in aviation today.

326
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,320
It's been a week since that Cessna citation

327
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,320
one jet came down just near Farmbro after only

328
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,320
after just taking off from big and hill.

329
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
And of course, you know, this is always of interest,

330
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
not just to me, but to many people,

331
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
and you'll never hear about it in the newspaper again.

332
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Maybe maybe maybe if the report comes out and it says,

333
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
and it states what I've heard,

334
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
and this is really horrible,

335
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,320
because you know, basically there's only two things that can happen

336
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
that can go wrong.

337
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
It's either maintenance,

338
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,320
which I would say is still 90% of all issues in aviation,

339
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,320
or it's pilot error, which can happen.

340
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,320
What I understand is that the jet took off almost empty,

341
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,320
with almost no fuel on board.

342
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,320
And that would explain why both engines quit.

343
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,320
That would explain the quote vibration

344
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,320
that the captain reported when he called in his May day,

345
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,320
because the jets will essentially rev up real fast

346
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,320
and trying to stay lit.

347
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,320
And particularly if there's a fadeck involved

348
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,320
fully authorized digital engine control,

349
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,320
so that could produce some kind of shuddering

350
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,320
or stuttering or something that seemed a bit like

351
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,320
what was reported as the pilot keyed the mic on his way down.

352
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,320
And you think about, how can that happen?

353
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
It's really quite easy.

354
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
And I think the circuits, if this is true,

355
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
and I don't want to put blame,

356
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
or say that this is the absolute truth,

357
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,320
is just what's circulating around in aviation circles.

358
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
This does seem to happen,

359
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
particularly when celebrities are involved.

360
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,320
And it's really, really sad, because you get an air cruise,

361
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
so they had a pilot and co-pilot.

362
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
They have never flown with each other,

363
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
or maybe once or twice,

364
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
they may not be an air-crew team,

365
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,320
particularly when you're in the game of renting planes,

366
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,320
or leasing, or calling up like a net jets,

367
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
or something of the like,

368
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,320
and so they may or may not have been all that familiar

369
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
with this particular aircraft,

370
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
probably they were.

371
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
But when you get like two celebrities,

372
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,320
they were two very famous former racing car drivers on board,

373
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
and you're going down to see the races.

374
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
And before you know it,

375
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,320
it's very easy to forget something like a fuel selector,

376
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,320
which seems like that would have been solvable,

377
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,320
if that was the problem.

378
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,320
But it's also possible that you actually can take off

379
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,320
without any fuel.

380
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,320
It's not the first time this has happened.

381
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
It's really, really horrible if that's where went down.

382
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,320
But man, so by the time the pilot had had

383
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,320
figured out that he had no more air speed left,

384
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
and just kind of floated down like a brick,

385
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,320
which is just what we call that as severely bad day

386
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,320
and aviation.

387
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,320
That's for sure.

388
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Okay.

389
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
Let's see.

390
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
What do we got?

391
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Oh yeah.

392
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
Christopher.

393
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Chris laden calling in from the UK.

394
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,320
Adam is Chris laden here.

395
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
Suspect the terrorist.

396
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
And podcasting, you sense.

397
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
You know,

398
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,320
I hate Section 44.

399
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,320
The terrorist met 2000 with a passion.

400
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
In total,

401
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
I was detained by the police,

402
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,320
an impressive four times,

403
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
and as many days during my stay in London.

404
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
You know,

405
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
once he's bad enough,

406
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,320
he's being stopped and searched four times,

407
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
come on.

408
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Adam, you've met me.

409
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
Since when have I been a threat to society?

410
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
Okay.

411
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
So I was a rotten kid.

412
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
All right.

413
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Stabbing people with scissors.

414
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
But I'm not a terrorist.

415
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
Secondly,

416
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
I just wanted to let you know

417
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,320
that the drama of my university projects is finished.

418
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
You know,

419
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
this is the drama based on the documentary,

420
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,320
which you yourself greased with your appearance.

421
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,320
Should you want to check it out?

422
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,320
You can do so by going to project

423
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
elements.podshow.com

424
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,320
or projects.

425
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,320
Hi,

426
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,320
for an element.com.

427
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
Thanks once again, Adam.

428
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Love you.

429
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
I mean,

430
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
it's and God save you from Section 44.

431
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
Yeah.

432
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,320
And I noticed something interesting over the weekend.

433
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,320
You probably saw that there were riots in London,

434
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
or near riots,

435
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,320
as people tried to extinguish the Olympic flame,

436
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
which came through London,

437
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,320
London,

438
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,320
and to run to Beijing.

439
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
This is very typical.

440
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
All these all these different cities,

441
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,320
and they light up torches from left to right,

442
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,320
and carry the flame all the way to open up the Olympic games,

443
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,320
just before the games actually start.

444
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
And it was amazing.

445
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,320
But now we had some real pissed off angry protesters.

446
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,320
And of course,

447
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,320
this is all in line with the human rights issues,

448
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,320
and how people are recognizing that China is suppressing Tibet.

449
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,320
Which turns out a lot of people live there about six or seven million.

450
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,320
It's amazing to me to what lengths people will go to,

451
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,320
to protest something like,

452
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
which is, and it's, by the way, it's a good protest.

453
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
If you want to protest,

454
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,320
what China's doing,

455
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
while they're hosting the Beijing Olympics,

456
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
so you want to disrupt the Olympics,

457
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,320
get some attention and bear us them.

458
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
So that makes sense.

459
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
But why don't we do that kind of stuff for,

460
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
the crap that's going on here at home?

461
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
You know, like,

462
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,320
would also read over the weekend,

463
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,320
the weekend's families are in crisis.

464
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
The family life is in crisis.

465
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
Binge drinking continues.

466
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,320
People are not even completing school.

467
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,320
If they're coming out,

468
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,320
they're total idiots.

469
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,320
Our freedoms are completely being taken away.

470
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Where's the protest over that?

471
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,320
I find that extremely interesting.

472
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
We're willing to go the mile for other people,

473
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,320
but we don't seem to want to do it for ourselves.

474
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Just one of those interesting observations

475
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,320
that you bump into from time to time.

476
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Hey, we've got a new levant and training here on the Charlie.

477
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,320
It's a guy who's close to my heart because everybody needs a friend

478
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
who's a Jamaican living in New York.

479
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Mr. Curry,

480
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,320
Jamaican in New York here.

481
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,320
But just want to leave a comment,

482
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,320
to move something that you mentioned,

483
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,320
near seeing on the footballer Friday.

484
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
No.

485
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Here's what you were talking about.

486
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,320
There's a lot of conspiracy theory stuff going on

487
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,320
about the federal reserve.

488
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,320
Stuff that actually doesn't really matter anymore.

489
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,320
How it was created or why it was created.

490
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,320
The fact that it is is really the problem at hand.

491
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
And this whole jekyll island thing,

492
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
that is a major conspiracy theory,

493
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
but I think it's almost distraction.

494
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
You know, this word,

495
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,320
destruction.

496
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,320
This is very interesting to me.

497
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,320
I believe that we have been distracted from great amount of time.

498
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,320
Many things actually.

499
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,320
You know, I think the war is a distraction for the oil prices.

500
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,320
Hold on a second.

501
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
I'm with you on the distraction,

502
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
my friend, my Jamaican friend in New York.

503
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
But I think the war is about something else.

504
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
Distractions are more like

505
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
entertainment tonight.

506
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
That's a distraction.

507
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Any form of mindless entertainment is a distraction.

508
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
But when it gets put on the front page of the newspaper,

509
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
continuously, like

510
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,320
Madeleine McCann or any wine house or Brittany Spears.

511
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,320
That's distracting you from the real news, obviously.

512
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,320
The Federal Reserve, you know, is asking for more powers.

513
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,320
And we are so distracted by the fact that our mortgages

514
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
are going into foreclosure.

515
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,320
But we can't even pay attention to the things that are happening.

516
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
You know?

517
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
Yeah, hold on.

518
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
Hold on a second.

519
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
I will say, you know,

520
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
that I think there were plenty of distractions

521
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
when we were all signing up to those mortgages, okay?

522
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,320
And the distraction was probably greed

523
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,320
and a bigger house and more stuff and more

524
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
bling.

525
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,320
And turn part of the distraction of what you see all around you

526
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
in the celebrity culture.

527
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,320
So in that regard, yeah, big distraction money.

528
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,320
I'm distracted by the money.

529
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,320
But they are putting cameras up to spy on us.

530
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,320
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no.

531
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
There's going on here.

532
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
No, man.

533
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,320
This is all a part of a master plan.

534
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,320
You know, there's going to be a mistake in any of this.

535
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,320
These people, people are planning planning all of this before

536
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,320
and we are just reacting exactly the way they expect us.

537
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
Hold on a second.

538
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,320
I'll take the tin foil hat off.

539
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
Hold on a second.

540
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
No one's forcing you to do anything, okay?

541
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,320
The fact that we're aware of maybe the possibility of

542
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,320
being some big master plan, which I think

543
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,320
would not be so much about the distractions in the media

544
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,320
would be more about implanting a chip in your arm.

545
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,320
If you don't, if you're not subservient to the man,

546
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,320
then they turn off your money and your identity.

547
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,320
Now, that would be a grand master plan,

548
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
who knows if it's taking place or not.

549
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,320
You see, they plan that as well.

550
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,320
Because they have decided not to educate us enough to understand

551
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
what is going on.

552
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
Yep.

553
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
No, we have to change this trend.

554
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
I don't know.

555
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,320
You know what I suppose is that we need to rise up against this.

556
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,320
Let them understand that they aren't in control.

557
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,320
We are in control.

558
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Yes.

559
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
Work.

560
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
For us.

561
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
Or us.

562
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Yes.

563
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,320
They work for us.

564
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
We want to shift the balance.

565
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
Yeah.

566
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,320
To the populace.

567
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Let's go out of this suit.

568
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
Do you make any New York?

569
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
Yo.

570
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
Yo.

571
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Thanks for listening to today's podcast.

572
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,320
This podcast has been easily made with the trial version

573
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:30,320
of Uber Huster, the only one podcasting solution for the McIntosh.

574
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,320
www.UverCaster.com

575
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,320
I guess that works.

576
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,320
That's a way to advertise your products.

577
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
By the way, that's for the McIntosh.

578
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
If you're looking for a great solution for Windows,

579
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,320
haven't mentioned it in a long-time castblaster.com

580
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,320
and a fantastic program that I was using for many years

581
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,320
until I switched back to the McPlatform.

582
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
It's just something I want to take a look at.

583
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
So, do you make it in New York, Mom?

584
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,320
Because you are a savant and training.

585
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,320
You need to do a little bit of work on your microphone there.

586
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
It sounds like you were talking into your laptop,

587
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
not always given the best results.

588
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,320
Regardless, here is a mashup just for you.

589
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,320
You are cool.

590
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,320
I've got loads to go play.

591
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,320
Here we live.

592
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
Do the things you need to come.

593
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,320
I'm gonna fight the ball.

594
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,320
I still don't think I could hold me back.

595
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:37,320
I've got to go with the ball.

596
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:43,320
Even the time right behind my back.

597
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:50,320
I'm holding to myself and I because I can't forget.

598
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,320
I don't fall into my mind.

599
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,320
But I don't see your eyes.

600
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,320
You always keep us right there.

601
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,320
I don't have such moments in my eyes.

602
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:17,320
I just don't need to do that.

603
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:25,320
I still don't fall into my mind.

604
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,320
I just don't want to go with you today.

605
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,320
I don't want to hold the ball in.

606
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,320
I'm gonna play the things you need to come to.

607
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,320
I'm gonna fight the ball.

608
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:54,320
I'm gonna play the things you need to come to.

609
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,320
I'm gonna play the things you need to come to.

610
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,320
I have kind of back heavy all around.

611
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,320
I'm gonna fight the ball.

612
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:17,320
I'm gonna play the things you need to come to.

613
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,320
I'm gonna play the things you need to come to.

614
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,320
I'm gonna play the things you need to come to.

615
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,320
I don't want to hold the ball.

616
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,320
I'm gonna play the things you need to come to.

617
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,320
I'm gonna play the things you need to come to.

618
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:54,320
I'm gonna play the things you need to come to.

619
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:01,320
I'm gonna play the things you need to come to.

620
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:07,320
I'm gonna fight the ball.

621
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:15,320
I'm gonna play the things you need to come to.

622
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,320
I'm gonna play the things you need to come to.

623
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Dracula 77 nation army mashed up as I said by DJ not I right here on the daily source code episode number 744.

624
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,320
Trip time for me this week tomorrow head and off to San Francisco and I'm going back either.

625
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:45,320
I'll you to take the red eye Wednesday night or Thursday night to New York because I have a couple meetings in the city on Friday and then back to the UK more meetings next week.

626
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,320
It's a busy busy.

627
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,320
I found this awesome new site called drop dot I.

628
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,320
Those of you who follow the weblog at curie dot com.

629
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
Not only seen it but I've also used it.

630
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:06,320
It's a very interesting kind of like a reverse version like a file system for a hush.

631
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,320
I call it more like a wiki for a file system or file for files and assets.

632
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,320
Maybe that's better.

633
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,320
And essentially you can upload.

634
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:27,320
Any type of file or you can leave notes or it even has a it's own voice mail that will then you know record the the incoming messages and put them on to the.

635
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:33,320
On to the page in MP3 format and what's really cool about it is you don't.

636
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,320
Need to register to use it.

637
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,320
So there is actually no knowledge whatsoever about who you are.

638
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,320
Well, I'm sure there's IP addresses and stuff.

639
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,320
They're not, they're not claiming a big security thing, but.

640
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:51,320
You basically, you know, you said a user password and you can set an admin password and you can create a what they call a drop for.

641
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,320
For anything at any time.

642
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,320
So let's say all of a sudden I was working on a project with a couple of people I'd create a drop.

643
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,320
It would be it have a URL which would be drop dot IO slash.

644
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,320
You know project items project.

645
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,320
And I can and anyone can start uploading files to it.

646
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,320
It's it's a hell of a lot easier than.

647
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,320
And a lot of these files sharing services.

648
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,320
There's also no ads.

649
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,320
It automatically creates an RSS feed within closures of everything you put up there.

650
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,320
There's something new added.

651
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,320
You can have email alerts and off.

652
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,320
I'm really liking it.

653
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,320
So I'll put it into the show notes again for today.

654
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:32,320
I think there's a hundred megabyte limit, which I'll more than likely upgrade, but I'll probably start deleting some stuff that is either already being used.

655
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,320
Or is just too big and useless.

656
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,320
There's some of that stuff going up as well.

657
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
But give it a shot.

658
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,320
I think these guys are on something really, really cool.

659
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,320
I'm not quite sure how.

660
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,320
Well, you know, I think somehow it's going to fit into what we're doing.

661
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
I'm not quite sure yet.

662
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,320
Maybe when they if they decide to expose an API, it could become even more interesting.

663
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,320
But this whole idea of creating drops.

664
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,320
I'm liking.

665
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,320
Check it out definitely.

666
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,320
It's drop dot IO.

667
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,320
Okay.

668
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,320
Let's continue.

669
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:12,320
You know, actually, I wanted to mention that George Soros, the international finance year.

670
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,320
One of the richest men in the world.

671
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,320
He's he has been in the financial markets for a long, long time.

672
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
He's been all over the news.

673
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,320
I saw at least three different places, including the financial times.

674
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
Parkie sent me a link that I looked at this morning.

675
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,320
But also Maria Barda Romo interviewed him over the weekend.

676
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,320
And he's just been on television everywhere saying, look, a recession is coming in the US.

677
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,320
Not exactly sure how big it is.

678
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,320
And he's going to a space where I've already had my head out, which is the whole idea of derivatives.

679
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,320
And I've been saying that this is much, much bigger.

680
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
And it's all based on trust.

681
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,320
And there is no central clearing house as of yet for derivatives.

682
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:57,320
The amount of these derivatives or CDS, I think it's credit default swaps is what they're called.

683
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,320
That's trillions and trillions of dollars.

684
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,320
I mean, there could be hundreds of trillions of dollars.

685
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,320
There's so many.

686
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,320
And these are basically just trades, okay.

687
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:18,320
Where the easiest and simplest way to look at is that there's maybe a trade where you need to buy a million dollars worth of stuff in the US.

688
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:24,320
Yet you live in the UK and you have 500,000 pounds worth of pounds.

689
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
And you can swap that.

690
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,320
So there's no loss in the foreign exchange.

691
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,320
And there's all kinds of micro-micro-sized interest payments.

692
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,320
It's a very complicated business.

693
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,320
When you get out of the CDS, these default swaps, which are actually quite easy.

694
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,320
They're kind of like one pages that are facts back and forth.

695
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
But it's for trillions of dollars.

696
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,320
And he's saying that the Fed was right to bail out Bear Stearns because it's not so much the mortgage crisis.

697
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,320
They could not default on these trillions of dollars of derivatives.

698
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,320
And what he's calling for now is something that even with my limited knowledge,

699
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,320
I know is something we need, which is a clearing house for all of these derivatives.

700
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
You should look up what derivatives are.

701
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,320
I'm sure there's a Wikipedia page on it, which will probably explain it in some degree.

702
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,320
It's really simple in its basis.

703
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,320
I mean, it really is just like trading hands across the borders.

704
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:25,320
But I'm trying to keep my eye on this and see where all this is going.

705
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,320
Get rid of your credit cards, that's for sure.

706
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,320
Try to stay off the credit, try to save some money.

707
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:37,320
And of course, we've got plenty of folks out there in the chucklehead audience who are calling with interesting tidbits and information.

708
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,320
And indeed, some explanation about how things work.

709
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,320
For instance, the question that Andrew Grummit asked me last week about federal reserve banking.

710
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Here's an answer to that one.

711
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,320
I wanted to give you a column for actual reserve banking.

712
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,320
It was interesting listening to you and Andrew talk on Wednesday, Charlie.

713
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,320
As you pre-owned for describing both sides of the same coin.

714
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,320
The way of fractional reserves or requirement works is that if you've got a hundred bucks,

715
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,320
you've got to keep ten bucks on books.

716
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,320
In the 90, you can lend out.

717
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,320
So, thank you, Andrew Grummit.

718
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:16,320
What ends up happening though, with this, as conventionally a thousand dollars total gets lend out.

719
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,320
You're right.

720
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,320
So, if you don't win, the way that works though is think about it.

721
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
You have to keep ten dollars on the books.

722
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
You can lend out 90.

723
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,320
When does that 90 dollars go?

724
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,320
It goes back to the bank pretty much.

725
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
You lend it up to someone that opposed it.

726
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,320
Now the bank can lend out another 81 dollars.

727
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,320
And so on and so on and so on.

728
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Eventually, you get a multiplier.

729
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:41,320
In fact, on the dollars, and with a ten percent reserve requirement, you get a ten-time multiplier.

730
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,320
Um, five percent reserve requirement, or do you get twenty-time multiplier.

731
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,320
So, that's pretty much how that works.

732
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,320
Um, an information in the gold standard.

733
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,320
You're not going to get to that in a minute.

734
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,320
Uh, um, people write paid speed assertations on stuff like that.

735
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,320
So, you know, we're going to open up over the weekend.

736
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Other than that, uh, let me read it.

737
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,320
Hope you win.

738
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Yeah.

739
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,320
I'll talk to you later.

740
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
Right on.

741
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
Okay.

742
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,320
That makes a lot of sense, of course.

743
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,320
I forgot about the interest part.

744
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,320
Okay.

745
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,320
So, Grummit and I were both right.

746
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,320
That's pretty good.

747
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:16,320
By the way, this portion of the, uh, the Charlie, the financial portion is brought to you by AccuQuote.

748
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,320
And you can get, uh, great life insurance at a seventy percent discount.

749
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,320
Up to seventy percent, if you use my checkout code, there's two ways to get to him.

750
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,320
AccuQuote.com slash dsc.

751
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,320
Or you can give them a call at 1-800-410-7214.

752
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,320
Let me know if you call them, okay?

753
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,320
I'm trying to figure out what kind of people don't have life insurance.

754
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,320
But, uh, maybe none of you have life insurance.

755
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,320
You should have some, really.

756
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,320
It's not all that expensive.

757
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,320
And take it if you're married or you have a significant other.

758
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,320
It's well worth it.

759
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,320
And again, up to seventy percent discount through AccuQuote.com.

760
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,320
Now, let's run to the gold.

761
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,320
Hey, Adam.

762
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
This is Trace from San Diego.

763
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:00,320
And I know this you've been talking a lot about the current credit crunch and what's happening in the economy.

764
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,320
And I, I'm a monetary scientist.

765
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,320
Now, actually, a critical website to how to explain some of these basics.

766
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
I love it.

767
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
Monetary scientist.

768
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,320
Come on in.

769
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,320
Officials, Vermont.

770
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,320
You're close.

771
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,320
Does that as my friend?

772
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,320
We eat a better name, though.

773
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
The official monetary scientist of the Charlie.

774
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
That sounds kind of good.

775
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,320
Science to people.

776
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,320
It's called run to gold.com.

777
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,320
Are you into urlb.com.

778
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:33,320
And there I, on the front page, I talked about the four main risks that are associated

779
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:40,320
with cash balances and a payment risk, counter-party risk, exchange rate risk.

780
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,320
And I wouldn't mind to have a couple of tips.

781
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,320
Yeah, we'll definitely take a look at the site run to gold.com.

782
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,320
I wouldn't mind if you, if you gave the Charlie heads some tips on what to do with their money.

783
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,320
Or should we be running to the gold and forget the paper?

784
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,320
Performance risk.

785
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:05,320
And what we are seeing right now is risk is being reprised.

786
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:10,320
Not just with the US dollar, but with all fiat currencies.

787
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,320
And so these fist and disinfectant so much collapse is evaporating.

788
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:24,320
And that's what we're seeing happen in entire markets like auction rate securities, mortgage tax securities, asset-back commercial paper, etc.

789
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
It's all evaporating.

790
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:34,320
And the counter-parties, to these contracts, which is bear-sterns, they really are too big to fail.

791
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:41,320
Bear-sterns, for example, was subject to about $13.6 trillion of risk.

792
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
There you go.

793
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
The derivative contract has been entered.

794
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:55,320
So there's no way that the Federal Reserve would want bear-sterns to fail because then you have $13.6 trillion of other assets,

795
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,320
but no longer insured or whatnot that counter-parties failed anyways.

796
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,320
So I wonder how that works.

797
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:06,320
I wonder how much money you need, what percentage of that, you know,

798
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:13,320
that big trillions of dollars number do you need in reserves in order to be seen as a healthy counterparty?

799
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Again, this is what Sauros is calling for.

800
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,320
He's saying, we should have a centralized system.

801
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:30,320
We need it yesterday, where the credit worthiness of these types of trades, swaps, literally, they're called swaps, like a swap meat, only with lots of money.

802
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,320
Where the counterparties can be guaranteed, they're not going to go out of business.

803
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Make sense.

804
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:41,320
Now that you're explaining the vastness of this, which, of course, I was kind of already on to, wow.

805
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,320
All right, website runtagold.com.

806
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,320
Outline some of the basics on monetary policy, and I have some videos there,

807
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:58,320
but some of the leading monetary scientists in the world, like Dr. Antalpecatee and Robert Landis,

808
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,320
who's JD from Harvard and some of the others anyways.

809
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,320
I think you might find some of it helpful, and it is a complex subject.

810
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,320
And so I'm trying to break it down so it's easily understandable for people.

811
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:18,320
Anyways, love your hair, keep up the good work, all the good stuff, and sign it all.

812
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,320
Bye.

813
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,320
All right, man, thank you.

814
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
All right, there you go.

815
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,320
The official monetary scientists of the Charlie.

816
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,320
Oh, hold on, that's my, I see what that is.

817
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
That means my 40 minutes are over.

818
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,320
We'll keep it going for a little bit longer, because we've got more about the federal reserve.

819
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,320
But I think that this is it, this is the guy.

820
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,320
Much more reliable than nylon, by the way.

821
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Here's the guy, the monetary scientist,

822
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,320
bringing you tips and tricks go to runtogold.com.

823
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,320
Hi, Adam, here's the board one.

824
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,320
There's taxation without representation.

825
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,320
That is the problem with the Fed.

826
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,320
By printing money, and I borrowing it at interest,

827
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:04,320
and then the Fed puts out more money, which he values the money that I already borrowed.

828
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
It isn't a sense.

829
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
He pays back to tax.

830
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,320
The problem is, I think it's a vote for who's on the Fed.

831
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,320
It's a private bank.

832
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,320
So, I've got no representation.

833
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,320
It's taxation without representation.

834
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,320
And that's the problem with the Fed in 60 seconds or less.

835
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,320
Love you, man.

836
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,320
Yeah.

837
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,320
Love it.

838
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,320
Folder.

839
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,320
Red pill.

840
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,320
I hear you.

841
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
I hope you wear it.

842
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,320
Yeah, I'll bet it.

843
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,320
Thank you.

844
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,320
Taxation without representation.

845
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
Well, I agree with that.

846
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,320
Because printing a more money, devalues our money,

847
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,320
causes inflation.

848
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,320
It's a hidden tax.

849
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,320
It is taxation without representation.

850
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,320
Although, of course, not officially called that.

851
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,320
But that's one for the cocktail parties, huh?

852
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
That's an easy way.

853
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,320
And under 60 seconds, what the hell is going on?

854
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,320
Well, you know how the Fed prints up money, whatever they want to, right?

855
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,320
So, that calls is inflation.

856
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,320
It devalues the dollars in your pocket.

857
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,320
That's the same as a taxation.

858
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,320
It's taxation without representation.

859
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,320
But I have another martini, please.

860
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
Hi, Adam.

861
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,320
This is Janice from New York.

862
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,320
I really thought about the conversation you've been having on the D.S.C.

863
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,320
About Muslims and the Netherlands.

864
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,320
Oh, yeah.

865
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,320
This is kind of heated up a little bit.

866
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,320
And I kind of expected that to happen.

867
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,320
We saw this big anticipation of, oh, the Heardveilders film is coming out

868
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
and fit another movie is what it's called.

869
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,320
I think there's a new re-edited version up on live league

870
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,320
and some other spots around the net.

871
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,320
I took the movie differently than the way it was explained

872
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,320
for instance by the prime minister of the Netherlands

873
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,320
who immediately, before the movie, he before he even seen the movie

874
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,320
when apologizing to everybody for it.

875
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,320
In fact, it's funny.

876
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
I saw it in reverse order.

877
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,320
It was up on two parts on YouTube.

878
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,320
And I saw a part two first, which I thought was far more interesting

879
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,320
than part one.

880
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,320
Part one is really, you know,

881
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,320
all these phrases from the Quran apparently translated properly.

882
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
I obviously don't know.

883
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,320
And then showing the real-life versions of what those pages mean,

884
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,320
I wasn't too interested in that.

885
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,320
What I was interested in was the issues of immigration

886
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,320
that were showing up in all the different news clippings,

887
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,320
which pretty much filled up part two.

888
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,320
So I would say that in indeed has a lot to do with the problems

889
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:32,320
of a lot more to do with immigration, as I've said before.

890
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,320
But now, we're seeing, I think it was at Pakistan.

891
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,320
There was a couple countries where, you know,

892
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:43,320
10, 20,000 people now calling for a feared builders head

893
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:49,320
on a stake, you know, boycotting Dutch products, you know, all kinds of,

894
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,320
all kinds of things that you don't typically get with other religions

895
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,320
when they're made fun of or when they're held up against the light

896
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,320
or when they're discussed in any form.

897
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,320
Except, of course, with Scientology,

898
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:06,320
those guys are probably the closest you can get to being really, really horrible.

899
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,320
They don't pose death threats, but I don't know what's worse.

900
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,320
Getting sued to oblivion or just getting shot and head.

901
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,320
I don't know which one I'd prefer.

902
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,320
You were saying that you think it's not a religious issue,

903
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,320
it's an immigration issue.

904
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,320
And I was even wondering whether it wasn't as much an immigration issue

905
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,320
as really an economic issue, so maybe the two spreads of conversation

906
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,320
you've been having on the DSC come together

907
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,320
when we're talking about money.

908
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,320
I don't know much about the Moroccan and the Netherlands,

909
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,320
but I would guess if they're probably poor.

910
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,320
Oh, I think this is exactly where it cuts.

911
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,320
And the same pretty much goes for the UK.

912
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,320
This really knows such thing as being poor in the Netherlands.

913
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,320
There's just no such thing.

914
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,320
Because it's a socialist state, it's a complete nanny state.

915
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,320
They take care of you from cradle to grave.

916
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,320
It's expected.

917
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:03,320
So lots of people who I know who have been on the dull or are,

918
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,320
or they can still take a vacation.

919
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,320
They can have a car in the driveway.

920
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,320
They get subsidized housing.

921
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,320
You know, it's not great.

922
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,320
It's not fantastic.

923
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,320
Look, you get seriously ill.

924
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
You want that to happen in the Netherlands, dude.

925
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,320
You know, all the shit my dad's going through.

926
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,320
All of the stuff my mom went through

927
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,320
or lung cancer, lung removal.

928
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:31,320
Everything all paid for by centralized medical care.

929
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,320
Governmentalized medical care, I should say.

930
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,320
So there really is no such thing as being poor.

931
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,320
And if anything, and a lot of that,

932
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,320
I think is the same for here in the UK.

933
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,320
What people say is, they come in.

934
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,320
They don't contribute.

935
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,320
And they just benefit from all of the great things

936
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,320
that we provide in this country.

937
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,320
That's exactly where it's cutting.

938
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,320
You see people who probably have no chance of really integrating

939
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,320
very well because there's no forced teaching of the language.

940
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,320
It's very easy to get around that to get out of it.

941
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:11,320
Big story in the Sunday Times over here about that over the weekend.

942
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:17,320
How all these, not the residency, but the citizenship tests are being

943
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,320
supported.

944
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,320
And I think that's exactly what's so irritating.

945
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,320
Why should someone else get great treatment if they don't appear

946
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,320
to actually want to contribute?

947
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,320
Which is a pretty human emotion, I think.

948
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:37,320
And when immigrant groups become a part of the economic fabric of a country,

949
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:42,320
then they become less interested in changing the fabric of that society.

950
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,320
Yeah, that's true.

951
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,320
If they weren't poor, it's kind of makes the problem maybe even

952
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,320
soluble because it's their economic status could be improved.

953
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:57,320
Then they might 48% of them might not be interested in changing the government anymore.

954
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,320
Anyway, this like 48% from what I understand,

955
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,320
don't want the current system of government.

956
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:09,320
They want a different type of law, such as Sharia law or a hybrid.

957
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,320
I thought Adam loves a show.

958
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,320
Love you.

959
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,320
I mean, it's so long.

960
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,320
Thank you, Janus.

961
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,320
That's appreciated.

962
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,320
It was another good show on the BBC on Saturday.

963
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,320
The big questions is what it's called.

964
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,320
If you live in the UK, you can see it on the BBC eye player.

965
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,320
Otherwise, hopefully someone uploaded that somewhere else.

966
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,320
We can take a look at it all hunt around.

967
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,320
See if it's on YouTube or Google video.

968
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,320
And it was a very good conversation about this.

969
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,320
Really open amongst a number of groups.

970
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,320
I think really the question was, do we have the right to offend?

971
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,320
Does the freedom of speech carry through?

972
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,320
And it's interesting because it's not that way in every country.

973
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,320
In Canada, there are some restrictions.

974
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,320
I think on free speech, you know, they're,

975
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,320
particularly when it comes to the multicultural society,

976
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,320
which seems to be working much better in Canada.

977
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,320
I've heard that they have this sitcom called Little House,

978
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,320
Little Mosque on the Prairie, and it's supposed to be really funny.

979
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:14,320
But it seems to me like they've dealt with the immigration differently in Canada.

980
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,320
And again, it comes down to immigration, how it's handled,

981
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,320
what the expectations are.

982
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,320
And really, you know, your government,

983
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,320
and you get the government you deserve.

984
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,320
Time and time again, you'll see,

985
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,320
every single nation gets the government it deserves.

986
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,320
No answers for you today, my friends.

987
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,320
Just more questions.

988
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,320
And here's one that was uploaded to the drop.io slash

989
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,320
daily source code.

990
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,320
Figured at my as well play and pod save for not.

991
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,320
It's a apology.

992
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,320
Not the churning.

993
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:15,320
How long is that for you?

994
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,320
Besides all you?

995
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,320
Don't you know?

996
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,320
Maybe it could be a while.

997
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,320
Even though I heard you,

998
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:41,320
I'm not good at all, I'm good at all.

999
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,320
I'm good at all.

1000
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,320
I'm not good at all.

1001
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,320
I'm not good at all.

1002
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,320
And maybe it would be a while.

1003
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,320
Even though I was going you.

1004
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:39,320
I can't find what I'm pulling down

1005
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:48,320
Tonight is my favorite

1006
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,320
The whiffs of the world

1007
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,320
We're all silent

1008
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,320
And then get me

1009
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,320
I call you

1010
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,320
And then I will call you

1011
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,320
And then get that's life

1012
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,320
Maybe it could be alright

1013
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,320
Even though I hold you

1014
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,320
If I were to touch us

1015
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:32,320
And make it right

1016
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:40,320
And make it right

1017
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,320
The band's name is Slings

1018
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,320
Title of the song is Apology

1019
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,320
Actually that was just emailed to me

1020
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,320
It wasn't sent through the drum

1021
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,320
I thought it was the drop

1022
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,320
Maybe it was

1023
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,320
Just a typical little email

1024
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,320
Please review and consider our new single

1025
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,320
Apology for you and your show

1026
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,320
You can also listen to some of our other songs

1027
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,320
Alright

1028
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,320
Get that shit up on the podcast

1029
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,320
Music Network, my friends

1030
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,320
That's where you want it to be

1031
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,320
That's where it's going to happen

1032
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,320
That's what billboard will be writing about

1033
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,320
In this coming week or next week

1034
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,320
God, I hope it's a good article

1035
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,320
Alright, everybody

1036
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,320
Let's see

1037
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,320
Will over the 40 minute mark

1038
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,320
Tomorrow

1039
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,320
No show, big big travel day

1040
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,320
But maybe I'll get away with one tomorrow night

1041
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,320
Which would be good for Wednesday

1042
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,320
So somewhere

1043
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,320
It'll be light on shows

1044
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,320
Just because of all the traveling

1045
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,320
But I'm taking everything with me

1046
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,320
So it's the minute I have a

1047
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,320
A couple of seconds to sit down

1048
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,320
And bring you a chuck

1049
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,320
Of course will

00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,320

You only get one

1058
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,320
Not a dress rehearsal
