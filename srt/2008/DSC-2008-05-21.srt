1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,660
You're Adam, this is Tony and Joey, you know I've been hearing you talk about rubbing

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,540
out cancer and I gotta tell you, I mean the boys will be specialized in rubbing people

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,000
out, but what is it Joey?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, what?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
He's talking about being north, eh?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Ah, yeah, Adam, you're going to take care of that yourself, you know what?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,240
You want to rub somebody out, you'll let me know, you want to rub out yourself, you

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:36,240
gotta take care of that yourself, you better explain it all on the DSC, 760, Capiche.

9
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:12,240
Wait, say, wait, I didn't wait, I'm in the same way, I'm in the same way, say, wait, I didn't wait, I'm in the same way.

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:21,240
You know the city can't sleep, you've all the secrets that keep telling the lights down, I don't know, all the fights, I don't know as a fix.

11
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,240
You'll be better than this, you'll be okay, you'll be okay, wake up, just wake up now.

12
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,200
No, you can't make me ...

13
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,240
Sorry, sorry, you're all going to be okay.

14
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,040
You'll be never able to pay to this, I'll be the way

15
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,440
You can't keep the side of what I've done

16
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,240
This thing will make your life real hard

17
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
I won't let you see me, I'll be the only one

18
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,240
You'll be never able to pay to this, I'll be the only one

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,240
Same way, same way, anyway, now that you're the same way

20
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,240
I've got you all figured out, it's just a fear

21
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
I'll take me over you

22
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,240
I'm a father of yours, I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a video

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,240
No, sleeper, radio, don't try to let me know

24
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,240
You're every feel, but I'm home

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,240
And you can't wait, wait, wait, wait

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,240
Tell me where I'm gonna be, I'll be the only one

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,240
You'll be never able to pay to this, I'll be the way

28
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,240
You can't keep the side of what I've done

29
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,240
This thing will make your life real hard

30
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
I won't let you see me, I'll be the only one

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Same way, same way, same way, anyway, now that you're the same way

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,240
I've got you all figured out, it's just a fear

33
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,240
And now that you're so far, I won't let you know

34
00:02:51,240 --> 00:03:08,240
You're every feel, but I'm home

35
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,240
And you can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

36
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Tell me where I'm gonna be, I'll be the only one

37
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Yeah, I'd say it takes all the boxes.

38
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Crash Mothers, where did all the scene girls go?

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,240
Kicking off Danny source code 7-6.

40
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Oh!

41
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
Coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey,

42
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,240
notice Gilford won the west side of G-town in the curry manner.

43
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

44
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Welcome to the program.

45
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
It's good to be back.

46
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,240
I had to show all lined up yesterday and was ready to rock and roll for you.

47
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
I almost ready.

48
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
I had most of the stuff pre-selected,

49
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
and I was ready to...

50
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,240
Ready to give you a good deal of the show there.

51
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,240
And then the teenagers started to act up a little bit.

52
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
As you know, we've got one.

53
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,240
A 17-year-old.

54
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
Oh, man.

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
You know, it's exam time.

56
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
That's what's going on.

57
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:25,240
And actually, I have to say that I think that Facebook is largely responsible for this kind of spiraling thing that we witnessed yesterday.

58
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Not really good.

59
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,240
You know, these kids, they sit there and, you know,

60
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,240
how things can start to heat up in a forum where flame war starts.

61
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
That's essentially what happens all the time on Facebook between kids.

62
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
You know, it's like half the time.

63
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,240
It's, oh, I love you.

64
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
You're my best friend.

65
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,240
You know, the whole concept of branding.

66
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,240
And then the other half of the time, which may be even more than half the time,

67
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
this flame war's.

68
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
It's a modern version of it.

69
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,240
If you've got a kid who's on Facebook, look over the shoulder from time to time.

70
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,240
And you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.

71
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Now, luckily, my daughter totally allows me to see her profile.

72
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
And everything that's going on there.

73
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
So I can kind of follow it.

74
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,240
And I don't interject, obviously, although my father Lee instincts really made me want to from time to time.

75
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
It's just a, oh boy.

76
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
They take some down this rabbit hole, the spiral.

77
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,240
I wound up actually taking away the laptop and I said, look,

78
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
leave this.

79
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
I printed out the book.

80
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,240
So she needed to continue studying from Gutenberg, Gutenberg,

81
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Godorg, which was, let's see, the tempest and a Jane Austen book.

82
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,240
And she just got back from her exams and she said she did okay.

83
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,240
So I think she, she probably actually did better than she's letting on.

84
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
But man, was that a major trouble yesterday.

85
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,240
Just hysterics.

86
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
What can I tell you?

87
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,240
By the way, I read somewhere that Facebook's web traffic is down.

88
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Something like 10% in their page views.

89
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,240
And I can totally understand why, because there's something new they've introduced into Facebook,

90
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,240
which is this concept of a chat window that kind of pops up in Ajax or whatever.

91
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,240
And that's now where the conversation is taking place,

92
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,240
most of the time except for something that they want to say that the kids want to say for

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,240
prosperity or want to publish the name.

94
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,240
You know, put it on someone's wall or do some kind of post like that.

95
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,240
But I don't see how, I think the model breaks with this, with this chat function.

96
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,240
You know, and of course it is taking over some MSM activity I can see.

97
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
I can just see it.

98
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
I can see what Christina is doing.

99
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
She's sitting there.

100
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
She's chatting.

101
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,240
She's no longer hitting different pages and looking at wall pages and refreshing.

102
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
It's interesting to see.

103
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Because of course Facebook's model is built entirely on page views.

104
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,240
It's been, see this in the second, we're midway through through the week of the second week

105
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,240
that I've been doing this stuff in the morning for this Dutch classic rock station called Arrow.

106
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,240
And I got to tell you, it's been, except for the getting up early,

107
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,240
which on the other hand is also I have to say kind of nice because now I'm doing pushups in the morning.

108
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,240
I go for a 40 minute walk and listen to, you know, a selected show.

109
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Basically, my channel lineup, which you can find at atom.mevio.com.

110
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,240
And I'm feeling, yeah, I'm feeling good and energetic and here we are.

111
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Seven minutes past one in the afternoon and I'm already recording the show.

112
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,240
I mean, this is like two to sometimes even three hours earlier than normal.

113
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,240
So chuckle heads, you're in for a little ride today.

114
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,240
Is interesting though, doing live, live stuff on the radio versus the show.

115
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,240
And I think it actually inspires me for what I'm doing here because it's just, you know, you have so much more.

116
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,240
Freedom really isn't the word, but because I know that you guys will, here it is.

117
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
Okay, this is the basic premise.

118
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,240
So first of all, I know that you couldn't listen to the show whenever you want to.

119
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
You don't have to tune in at any specific time.

120
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,240
That obviously is something that I worked hard on figuring out in the beginning of all this.

121
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:53,240
But I also noticed that I'm much more prone or less reluctant, I should say, to play something really long.

122
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Like we got a lot of comments about that poem I played on Monday.

123
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,240
You know, because I know that if you're not into it, if you're not digging it, all you have to do is just fast forward.

124
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,240
So it's, you know, it's a completely interactive, two-way medium and I'm really digging it.

125
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,240
Particularly, well, I'm just feeling good and particularly because my prostate cancer prevention quota went up by one count.

126
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
I'd say no more than 30 minutes ago.

127
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Hi, Adam. It's been in Bond as you're how you're doing.

128
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Good, man.

129
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,240
I wanted you to know, I just went through the grocery store, check out Lyme.

130
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,240
As I was getting ready to pay, the checker asked me if I wanted to donate it,

131
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
to help prevent prostate cancer.

132
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,240
That's what we're not working on on my own.

133
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,240
Just thought that was kind of fun.

134
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Yeah.

135
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Both on her face, like, told her that was like, fine.

136
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Anyway, still waiting for my own jiggle.

137
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
Love you.

138
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,240
So homo.

139
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Hope you win.

140
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
I think you already have all that.

141
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
See you.

142
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Hi, man.

143
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Thank you.

144
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Continuing on the PCPQ, the prostate, the prostate cancer prevention quota.

145
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,240
John W. Kids says, Adam, does a larger emission volume require a lower frequency?

146
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Can a large emission volume or a higher frequency then required be traded in just like trading in CO2 emissions?

147
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Carbon credits.

148
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Yes.

149
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
Cancer credits.

150
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
Absolutely.

151
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,240
I don't know, actually.

152
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,240
If there's any medical savants out there in the chuckle head audience, let me know about that.

153
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,240
I actually had a laugh about cancer for a second there.

154
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Today would have been my mom's birthday, the 21st of May, is when I'm recording this.

155
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,240
And I think she probably would have seen the irony of this prostate cancer prevention

156
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
of laughter.

157
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,240
She's probably, you know, she's sitting up there and she's laughing down on all of us.

158
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
And she's saying, go boy, go!

159
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
Rob one out for cancer.

160
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
You could do it.

161
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Oh, hello.

162
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
From Germany.

163
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Oh, and Nick from Germany.

164
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Couldn't I?

165
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I've contacted you many times before.

166
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
I'm the host of the Schlaffers in München podcast.

167
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Not yet.

168
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
I'll remember.

169
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
There are two things I would like you to talk about.

170
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
One.

171
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Sometime ago, you mentioned that pocho was planning to come to Germany and we were all looking

172
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
forward to it.

173
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
And now, there's no news on that topic.

174
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
So what about it?

175
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Will you be opening a German headquarters in Podstam or did you decide to go somewhere else?

176
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,240
Well, let me, let me, let me do something else.

177
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,240
I'd like to get in there ASAP, honestly, Nick.

178
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,240
I think I had mentioned this before on the show.

179
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,240
We really had to focus our energies in a couple other places first, which we reorganized

180
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,240
and those whole whole number of business reasons for that.

181
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,240
And so we just really, I think we jumped the gun a little bit ourselves.

182
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
We really weren't quite ready.

183
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Myself certainly included because I would be largely responsible for getting everything up and running

184
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
and overseeing everything.

185
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
And of course, we still have the London office.

186
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,240
Now, the flying back and forth could be no chore, not even a chore.

187
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,240
In fact, it would be quite pleasurable for me because I'd be flying the Delta Shiera.

188
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,240
But we're just not ready for it.

189
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,240
But it is next on our list, the minute we can.

190
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,240
And that minute could come sooner than you think.

191
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Watch this space, my friends.

192
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
And very curious about that.

193
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,240
And the second thing is, recently, you seem to experiment with live podcasting.

194
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,240
You seem to use talk show and live 365.

195
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
Live 365.

196
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
That's a new trend.

197
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,240
If you maybe consider producing a live podcast in the future.

198
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,240
And if you think that we all will be not podcasts, but private radio people.

199
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Well, I think we already are a neat guy.

200
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
I think we aren't private radio people.

201
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
It's just the radio works a little bit differently.

202
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Now, the whole thing about doing it live, which is kind of on hiatus for me.

203
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Because there's some technical problems people weren't able to get the stations.

204
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Even though there were plenty of slots available for different people to tune in.

205
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:51,240
And I really do like 365 mainly because it enables me to legally play some mashups and other stuff.

206
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,240
And the artist will get paid for that.

207
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,240
So there's still work on it. I've been back and forth with a text there.

208
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:06,240
But for me, really besides that one point, which is playing music that normally I would be pretty much illegal to play.

209
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,240
I like the instant feedback of people listening.

210
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,240
Usually there's like 50 people at one point there was more than that.

211
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,240
But as I said, we're having all kinds of technical difficulties.

212
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,240
I like it when people are then twittering me and giving feedback the minute I'm actually doing the show.

213
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:30,240
So it's not so much the benefit of giving a handful of people, certainly a small percentage compared to the entire chuckle head audience.

214
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,240
It's not so much giving them the benefit of hearing it live.

215
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,240
It's really, for me, getting the feedback loop.

216
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
That's what I enjoy about it.

217
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Opening our own radio stations, maybe.

218
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,240
I was assigned the tasks to do some research on the topic for a German radio station.

219
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:53,240
Well, yeah, I know you have many press inquiries and that's why I'm trying to contact you this way.

220
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,240
Maybe that is the only way to get a hold of me.

221
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
You know that.

222
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,240
But that in your show, and then I can just use your statements from your show for my radio station.

223
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
Okay.

224
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
And you'll get paid for it too, right?

225
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,240
That's it for now.

226
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Many greetings from Munich.

227
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
And then I'm signing off with...

228
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
I feel I hope you win great hair.

229
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Love you, of course.

230
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
What else?

231
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
What else?

232
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
Thank you.

233
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
Take a picture.

234
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Thank you, thank you.

235
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
Bye bye, Adam.

236
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
Oh, yeah.

237
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
You know you won't get naked.

238
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
Sorry.

239
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,240
Oh, she knows me so well.

240
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Anik, guy, you'll be the first one I'll be looking for when we move into Germany.

241
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
All right, guys.

242
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
This is a big one.

243
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
I've been sitting on this for a couple days.

244
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
The news has already been spread out.

245
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,240
You've heard of it by now because it's something that's getting blocked all over the place.

246
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Only unlike what a lot of people have been sending me, which has been mainly links from the BBC website that this would be happening in the UK.

247
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:59,240
It seems to be a European initiative, and I'll let Oscar our buddy from the Netherlands tell you all about it.

248
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
He prepared to be shocked to my friends.

249
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,240
Very, very shocked.

250
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
Hi, Adam.

251
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
This is Oscar from the Netherlands.

252
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:18,240
I just saw a very nice RTL news broadcast about privacy of, well, every European citizen mostly.

253
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:34,240
So the European Union has decided that they will archive all, all phone calls, connections, and all email traffic for, well, somewhere between six months and at least two years.

254
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
So listen to that folks.

255
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:46,240
This is a European Union initiative, which apparently the UK has already picked up on, has already working on, to archive all email traffic.

256
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,240
I think web traffic may be included in there, but see what the hell if you're doing it anyway, minus we'll do it right.

257
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,240
And also phone calls.

258
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,240
I don't know if they're actually recording the phone calls themselves.

259
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
I think it's phone records.

260
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
But this is echelon.

261
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
Okay, this is echelon.

262
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Let me say it again.

263
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,240
This is echelon in case you're tracking me right now.

264
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,240
This is really, really, really bad.

265
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:17,240
And I know that there's people getting up in arms and protesting this all over the European Union.

266
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,240
We really have to stand behind this.

267
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,240
And I'm going to bite my teeth.

268
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,240
I'm going to sink my teeth into this one like a terrier, not of the Yorkshire variety, but of a terrier.

269
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,240
And keep on it because this cannot pass law.

270
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
This may not happen.

271
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,240
For everybody, this is going to be a European thing.

272
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,240
So this is kind of big.

273
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:47,240
So of course this is raised some issues and everybody, well, some people are shouting at least the left parties are.

274
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,240
But those are the only ones that really object to this well publicly.

275
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
Everybody else is just saying, oh, no.

276
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
No, no, no, no.

277
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
Chalheds.

278
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Chalheds.

279
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
We have a responsibility.

280
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,240
We cannot just sit around and say, oh, no, yeah, we've really got to actually do something.

281
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
I don't care.

282
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
I don't have anything to hide.

283
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
Yeah.

284
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,240
See about that when the real thing happens.

285
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,240
So this is just, so this is a million, a few million euros.

286
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Well, probably more than that.

287
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
That's good.

288
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,240
For just a few cases of where they just miss out some, some bits and pieces of information.

289
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
And how about you?

290
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,240
It's hundreds and millions.

291
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,240
This is a big ass project.

292
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,240
This is something the Oracle is just, you know, salivating about because I'm sure they'll be using their technology.

293
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
No, no, no, this is big.

294
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,240
This is, forget the money, though.

295
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,240
What right?

296
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,240
It's not road to what rights do we have?

297
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
It's what rights do we have left over?

298
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,240
And you can have a long term archives for this.

299
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,240
So there goes privacy for you.

300
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,240
I think this is just fitting in from just better to even worse.

301
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
Anyway.

302
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,240
Yeah, that's it.

303
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
Great hair.

304
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,240
Hope you win folder repeal.

305
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Well, between four and six times a week.

306
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Oh, my goodness.

307
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Good on that.

308
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Good man.

309
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
Yeah.

310
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
I think that's it.

311
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
All right, I'll start.

312
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Bye.

313
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,240
All right.

314
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Good job, man.

315
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Oscar from the Netherlands checking in with that.

316
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,240
Hey, guys, whenever you can, I love the links and I love the emails you send me.

317
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,240
Wouldn't it?

318
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Whenever you can just call into the voice mail line.

319
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,240
Whenever you can record an audio comment, it's really, really appreciated.

320
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,240
And I think what's the change to sign off once again?

321
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,240
I think we should change it to they work for us.

322
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Sign off like that, William.

323
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
They work for us.

324
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
That's the message we need to be sending.

325
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,240
In fact, there's a website now.

326
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,240
Lawrence McBride sent this to me.

327
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
They work for us.

328
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
They work for you dot com.

329
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Although it is they work for us is the sign off here in the charity.

330
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,240
They work for you dot com.

331
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,240
That's for folks living in the UK.

332
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,240
And you can even you can track your member of parliament.

333
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,240
You can track it down by your postal code.

334
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,240
And you can get RSS alerts.

335
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
It's really good.

336
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,240
I'm sure there's a US equivalent.

337
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
If you know one, let me know.

338
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Send me a link and I'll be sure to publicize it.

339
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,240
But let's, let's agree on that.

340
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
Okay.

341
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
They work for us.

342
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
Sign off.

343
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
That is the new slogan.

344
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Comic strip.

345
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Comic strip.

346
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
Comic strip.

347
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Comic strip.

348
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
Comic strip.

349
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Comic strip.

350
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Comic strip.

351
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Comic strip.

352
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
Comic strip.

353
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
Comic strip.

354
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Comic strip.

355
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Once again in our EU, you correspond to Comic strip.

356
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,240
Comic strip blogger checks in.

357
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Yo.

358
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Yo.

359
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,240
I don't know.

360
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,240
In music, carry.

361
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
They use this.

362
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Yo, European Union correspondent.

363
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
Comic strip blogger.

364
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
So Italy is now considering

365
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,240
suspension of freedom of movement right of EU.

366
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
What is the very bet?

367
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,240
Because it's one of four basic freedoms.

368
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Yo.

369
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
How are they doing that?

370
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
Comic strip blogger?

371
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,240
I don't understand.

372
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
What they're doing to restrict freedom of movement in Italy.

373
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,240
You know, if your life with passion and freedom or whatever.

374
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,240
The reason are gypsies from East EU.

375
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,240
But I think that no reason is good enough to abolish

376
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
basic freedom.

377
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
More info CSB.

378
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,240
More info.

379
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Maybe your sister Willow, who lives now in Italy.

380
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,240
I could send some of your feedback about it too.

381
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
Being a gypsy, you know, right?

382
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
yourself.

383
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
No.

384
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,240
No.

385
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,240
I knew it.

386
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,240
She is afraid about speaking out.

387
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
And fuck you.

388
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
Adam Kerry.

389
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Because still there's no RSS feeds to comments.

390
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
Put the cuts in your company.

391
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,240
You.

392
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,240
Yeah.

393
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
CSB.

394
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
You know, I do that just to wind you up, man.

395
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,240
I said, whatever you do, don't put RSS feeds on the comments on the shows.

396
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
Whatever you do, do not develop that.

397
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,240
Please, don't.

398
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,240
I've given Express commands and instructions.

399
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
Yes, CSB.

400
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
When you call on that report, I am intrigued by this.

401
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
What Italy is doing.

402
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
I guess I could hunt around for.

403
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,240
But if you got a link specifically, send it to me because I'm very interested in that.

404
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,240
Some different, which, wow, I had no idea this was going to hit such a nerve.

405
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,240
This poem that I played for you on Monday.

406
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,240
Really, really struck a nerve with a lot of people.

407
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
They really liked it.

408
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
I got a lot of email response people.

409
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Well, actually, let me play a couple of them for you.

410
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Here exactly what I mean.

411
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,240
I hope you enjoyed it as well because I got another one for you.

412
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
Hi, Adam.

413
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,240
Eric from Portland.

414
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,240
I just wanted to chime in on Aaron Livingston's Accounting type home.

415
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,240
That is exactly the type of thing that I am coming to your info for.

416
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,240
It's the long format audio that I'm getting nowhere else.

417
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,240
It's the point of views that the magazines and newspapers I read do not provide for me.

418
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
The books I read do not do it.

419
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Television is a waste.

420
00:20:49,240 --> 00:21:02,240
The dichotomy of the United States with the red and the blue states fighting while we're bleeding in the purple center and getting no attention has got to stop.

421
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,240
Now, for my shout out, I got it to say that I'm a red, killed, folding, prostate 10.

422
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
You do!

423
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
Lovely.

424
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
Right on, man.

425
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
The bleeding purple heart in the middle.

426
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
I like the sound of that.

427
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Yeah.

428
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,240
By the way, just looking at what's going on in the Democratic race, which of course is still not over.

429
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,240
I think I'm going to have to agree with John C. Dvorak.

430
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,240
I think Hillary Clinton is going to nail the nomination.

431
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
I know it sounds counterintuitive.

432
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,240
I know it's not the way the numbers are stacking up right now, but I think that's exactly what the party is going to choose.

433
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,240
Of course, we'll know in a few weeks from now.

434
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
More on this poem.

435
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,240
And this is a really good one.

436
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
This is almost a rant in the positive sense.

437
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
I love it.

438
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
Hey Adam, hey.

439
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
This is the sales weeds.

440
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
Again, back from two weeks.

441
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,240
Sales weeds.

442
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,240
I gotta tell you, I really enjoyed your 759.

443
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,240
I love the poem that was from Aaron Livingston.

444
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
I love her passion.

445
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:05,240
I love the fact that you played it in it's part of the artist out there that is not just music.

446
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,240
Even if a goofy guy like me that can call up and say, hey, keep it up.

447
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Just keep it up.

448
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
Stay off the grid.

449
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,240
Stay off the stupid stuff that television have just mindless crap that we just see every day.

450
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,240
And if we can just keep the conversation going, just it allows us to be a little bit better.

451
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,240
And I think there's a growing, I don't want to repeat myself from a couple weeks ago.

452
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:38,240
But I do sense of growing young people that are going to get it better than we did.

453
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,240
And they're starting to, and they have got these eyes that are wide open.

454
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,240
And all they need to do, now that this is internet, if you want to call it, whatever you want to call it,

455
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,240
this media revolution that we're in, it's a worldwide.

456
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:59,240
It is something that slowly, but surely it's building skin and it's going to make things happen.

457
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,240
I see it.

458
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,240
And I just want to tell you, and why I'm saying this to you, thank you for your listeners.

459
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
They call in.

460
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Thank you for the news that you play.

461
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,240
Thank you for all the stuff that you do that's even.

462
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,240
I know it's got to be hard work.

463
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
And you put your life in it and I can tell.

464
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,240
And those people that make that take it lightly, try it.

465
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Just try it.

466
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
Try to do what Adam does.

467
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,240
That's what I have.

468
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,240
Yeah, try to rub one out one every day. You know, it ain't easy.

469
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,240
I bet you wouldn't be able to do it nearly as good, nearly as consistent.

470
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,240
And I'm not saying this could be on your show.

471
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,240
I'm just saying it because it is something that makes can't be.

472
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,240
To listen at the end of the day instead of watching the damn television.

473
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,240
Hell yeah.

474
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,240
Something different, expand the mind a little bit, expand the universe a little bit,

475
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,240
and appreciate the finer things in life.

476
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,240
Because once we can start getting to those things and agreeing and just getting off the

477
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,240
cramp, they put your stone and maybe maybe we're just

478
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,240
s yoken up a little bit and we keep our.

479
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
We're just going to be better.

480
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,240
We can just be better. That's all and that's all I wanted to say.

481
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Oh man, thank you so much.

482
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,240
Remember, they work for us. That's the new slogan.

483
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Okay, so here it is.

484
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,240
This is a new one sent in by Russell B.

485
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,240
And quality is not fantastic.

486
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
And it's not in front of a live audience,

487
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
but I really like the lyrics to this.

488
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
It's because it's that we call it a poem.

489
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Do you talk about lyrics?

490
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
It's called sober America.

491
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,240
And I'm proud to present it to you right here on your daily source code.

492
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,240
To what ends shall become of us.

493
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,240
We children of this land.

494
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
A fighter, hate and misery.

495
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,240
We call upon command.

496
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,240
To smite those who have coden us.

497
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
To free them from their plight.

498
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,240
We'd rather bathe in luxury.

499
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,240
To stand up for what's right.

500
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,240
Who can be blamed for all our shame.

501
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,240
We swat them down like flies.

502
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,240
Forgetting all the roles we played that led us to these lies.

503
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,240
We cannot shame the world for chains that we did not use first.

504
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,240
The times too short, too worry worked.

505
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,240
The morning brings our hers.

506
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,240
In what regard do we now charge our brothers into war?

507
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,240
To blindly kill and pose our will forever wanting more.

508
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,240
We shall and cry for genocide.

509
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,240
But call it freedom's will.

510
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Well, rich men, plain are future stands.

511
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,240
The poor men fronts the bill.

512
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,240
What can we do but celebrate our heroes have come home.

513
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,240
I'll drip the shades of peasantry.

514
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,240
The colors of our toll.

515
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,240
But need the flags and hickory.

516
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
The testimony fades.

517
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,240
Release from all their suffering.

518
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,240
Their victims that we made.

519
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,240
Can all we do is turn our heads when hypocrites are named.

520
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,240
The power of these words we give exposed when we are ashamed.

521
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,240
But rather than be washed by them that we might carry on.

522
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Let's cloak ourselves in shuffessness and flee back from the dawn.

523
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,240
Do towers falling in our dreams still justify our hate.

524
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,240
We'll chain up those we took suppose to redirect our fate.

525
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,240
Do not blame me.

526
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,240
It's plain to see our motto and our prayer.

527
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,240
We give away our freedom's paid no longer do we care.

528
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Well, we who live beyond the fray reach out to help the rest.

529
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,240
Those bound in change of poverty is to hunt us like a ghost.

530
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,240
Reflections of the lives we live remind us of the truth.

531
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:57,240
That we are bound by arrogance, a product of our youth.

532
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:05,240
I am going to take a saucecult.

533
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,240
I am going to get carried away.

534
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,240
I am going to get carried away.

535
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,240
This has got to be my most favorite song of the week,

536
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,240
maybe even the month.

537
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Skinny Jones, spitters sweet tears on the Charlie.

538
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Sit down and show it has been a while.

539
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,240
What did you do?

540
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
What did you hate?

541
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
I get lucky.

542
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,240
Living your love, have you finally found?

543
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
If you were trying to find?

544
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,240
Ever not a drink.

545
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,240
The night still young.

546
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,240
There's more one in the world only just me.

547
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,240
As your mom and dad, do you still go strong?

548
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,240
When your dreams are in the between and the wrong?

549
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,240
Bittersweet tears.

550
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
I cry.

551
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,240
When I think about this time,

552
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
a busy life,

553
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,240
and love,

554
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,240
to simple.

555
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:17,240
Drop the man I don't want to hear.

556
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,240
Of course I'm sad about what you want.

557
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,240
I just can imagine you being somebody's wife.

558
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
Feels like only yesterday.

559
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,240
I saw you alive.

560
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
Bittersweet tears.

561
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,240
I cry.

562
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,240
When I think about this time,

563
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,240
a busy life,

564
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
and love,

565
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,240
to simple.

566
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,240
I see you still do your hair.

567
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,240
Bittersweet tears.

568
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,240
I can feel them.

569
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
I just can feel them.

570
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,240
Back then,

571
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,240
show it up and live,

572
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,240
but the good things from now,

573
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,240
Raptain memories with some things

574
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,240
Yet I wonder if you feel so

575
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,240
Do you laugh about the best of all

576
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,240
So be the sweetest

577
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,240
You cry

578
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,240
When you think about this time

579
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
Or be the life

580
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,240
And love a simple

581
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,240
I'm be the sweetest

582
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,240
You cry

583
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,240
When I think about this time

584
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
Or be the life

585
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,240
And love a simple

586
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,240
This we teach you

587
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
You cry

588
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,240
When I think about this time

589
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Or be the life

590
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
And love a simple

591
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,240
Oh, man, do I love this song?

592
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,240
Has a bit of the

593
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
Alessie Brothers

594
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,240
Oh, Lori vibes somehow

595
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
And it's song I can't find anywhere

596
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,240
By the way, nowhere to be found on the interwebs

597
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,240
That's a skinny Jones

598
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,240
You can find him at skinnyjones.com

599
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Guy from the Netherlands

600
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
That one bittersweet tears

601
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
You can purchase the songs right there from the site

602
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,240

00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,240
Use credit card or PayPal

604
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,240
I think 99 cents

605
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
No DRM

606
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Love them, love them

607
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Let's see

608
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
What else is going to say?

609
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Yeah, I was actually going to mention

610
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
This is clearly not a song

611
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,240
I could play on a classic rock station

612
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
Let's just take one as an example

613
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
And I really get enjoyment from playing it

614
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
For you guys

615
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
I just noticed that

616
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,240
I'm sitting here tapping my toes

617
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
Going hell yeah

618
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
I'm loving it

619
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
I'm loving sharing the experience

620
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,240
Crap, I'm such a damn hippie

621
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,240
Hey, this message is for Megan and all

622
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,240
From Celebrity Service

623
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,240
Looking to reach Adam Curry

624
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,240
Celebrity Service

625
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
I wonder what she wants

626
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
Let's find out

627
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,240
957-0698

628
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,240
It's regarding a medial quest

629
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,240
Thank you, Bobbi

630
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,240
A medial request?

631
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Or a medial?

632
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
What did she say?

633
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,240
Why just listen to something?

634
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,240
I need it's regarding a medial quest

635
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
Thank you, Bobbi

636
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
Sounds like medial request

637
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
I don't want any medial

638
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
Oh man

639
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,240
I should have had a Skype to hook that

640
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,240
I'll follow that one up with you for sure

641
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,240
We'll see what else I have in the list here

642
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,240
Of stuff to talk about

643
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
Oh yeah

644
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,240
I found this awesome, awesome NPR show

645
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,240
On the drop

646
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,240
That's drop.io slash daily source code

647
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,240
It's called the giant pool of money

648
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,240
And it starts off with a bit of audio

649
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
From an award show

650
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
With a bunch of bankers sitting around

651
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
Give in each other awards

652
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,240
And they actually give out an award

653
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,240
For the creation of the CDO

654
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,240
You know this is the instrument

655
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
That was backed by all these fucked up

656
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,240
Lame ass mortgages

657
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
The guy actually received an award for it

658
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
You must hear this show

659
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
It's fantastic

660
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,240
It's right at the top there

661
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,240
And this brings me to the next problem

662
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,240
Because the drop is basically filled up

663
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,240
That's almost the drop that did it

664
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,240
Because I have one gig

665
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,240
Folks over there were kind enough to give me a gig

666
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
And I've emailed them

667
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,240
And I said hey I want to purchase another 10 gigs

668
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
Because I don't want to delete anything

669
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
I want to save all this stuff

670
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,240
It's so nicely categorized and organized

671
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,240
It's just like a blog

672
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
It's good stuff

673
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
And I don't want to get rid of it

674
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,240
But I think we only have maybe 50 megs left of space

675
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
And I haven't been able to get a whole of them

676
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,240
Or at least they've emailed me

677
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,240
And so I've used that email address

678
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,240
And said please please please please

679
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
Just tell me where I can buy it

680
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
I don't care what it costs

681
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
I want to keep everything intact

682
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,240
It's great the chuckle heads of love it

683
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,240
So maybe they'll hear this plea

684
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,240
And one thing I do want you to see

685
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,240
Required homework

686
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
Particularly if you live in the UK

687
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,240
But it'll work in the US as well

688
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,240
Because you'll see what's happening over here

689
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,240
And what can happen in our own country

690
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,240
It's really a shocking report

691
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
From current TV that aired on television

692
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
I embedded the video

693
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,240
About basic filming in public in the UK

694
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,240
And you'll see some police officers harassing this guy

695
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
And put a throwing on real attitude

696
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
Telling him to shut up

697
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Telling him he has no right to film in public

698
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Which of course he absolutely does

699
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,240
That he's acting suspicious

700
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
I mean it's really bone chilling when you see it

701
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,240
It's just duh

702
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,240
That's required watching

703
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
I won't take you too long

704
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,240
Then actually I think that the giant pool of money

705
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
Is also required listening

706
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
You can download it from the drop as well

707
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
And then thank you very much Glenn

708
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,240
From the city show which is

709
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,240
Or the city podcast I think

710
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,240
Glenn is in South Africa

711
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,240
And I said what is going on with the xenophobia

712
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,240
Which is the word to jure by the way

713
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,240
Killing people

714
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,240
And setting them on fire where they're live is what I call it

715
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,240
But okay, we'll give it the names xenophobia

716
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,240
But it's messed up in South Africa

717
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,240
And Glenn has all the details for us

718
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,240
Glenn, come on in

719
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,240
Hi Adam, it's Glenn you from Cape Town South Africa

720
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,240
And I thought I'd chime in regarding the

721
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,240
Terrible xenophobic violence that's been happening here

722
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,240
During the last nine days

723
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,240
Now basically it all started

724
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,240
In a township called Alexandra in Johannesburg

725
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,240
And actually has spread

726
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,240
As spread to many other townships around Johannesburg

727
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,240
In partying

728
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,240
I think that as a nine other eight provinces of South Africa

729
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,240
A very lucky so far not to have seen these

730
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,240
xenophobic attacks in the sense of the violence

731
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,240
That has been generated over the last nine days

732
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:02,240
Yeah, it's all because foreigners who are in

733
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,240
So who are coming when I say foreigners

734
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,240
I'm referring to people from other African countries

735
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,240
Yeah, I'm really glad you cleared that up

736
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,240
Because in Africa, indeed if you go to South Africa

737
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
And you're from the Congo for example

738
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,240
Or Uganda, you are a foreigner

739
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,240
It's a different country, you know

740
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,240
And clearly your view does a foreigner

741
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,240
And we specifically mentioned Zimbabwe

742
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,240
Of course we all know about the gross human rights violations

743
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,240
And absolutely anarchy that's occurring in Zimbabwe

744
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
Is driving a lot of

745
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,240
A lot of the population down to South Africa to seek asylum

746
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,240
And also not to forget other African countries

747
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,240
Up north of the Congo, the DRC

748
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,240
The names just gone

749
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,240
And of course they see South Africa as the land of milk and honey

750
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,240
Now South Africa is one of the one of the is a country that does allow

751
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,240
It's the silent asylum seekers or refugees to integrate

752
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,240
And of course a lot of them with virtually no money

753
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,240
And with the close and their backs have settled into

754
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,240
A lot of the townships around South Africa

755
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,240
And from what I understand a lot of them are even better educated

756
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:24,240
Than the South African themselves and speak fluid English

757
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,240
And that's causing a lot of anxiousness I would say

758
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
Clearly

759
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,240
And of course in this case in Johannesburg

760
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,240
And of course they've built up businesses

761
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,240
They have been able to get employment

762
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,240
And so forth

763
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,240
And basically the locals aren't happy

764
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,240
With the fact that they are taking their jobs

765
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,240
Their houses and their women

766
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,240
And this is sparked on a courageous violence

767
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,240
From the locals to these foreigners

768
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,240
I'm talking really 22 people have died

769
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,240
I mean there is a front cover page

770
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,240
In the times of a person burning today

771
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,240
I'll send you that link as well

772
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,240
It's really really sad to see this

773
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,240
And these are the images that we were very familiar with

774
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,240
During apartheid and that these images

775
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,240
Have to read their heads again

776
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,240
14 years later

777
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,240
And of course not to forget that we are going to be hosting

778
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,240
The 2010 soccer World Cup in

779
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
To very very short years

780
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,240
Time

781
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,240
So I hope that government actually pulls its finger out

782
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,240
It starts doing something about it

783
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,240
It's Glenn Veren from Cape Town South Africa

784
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,240
Great here, hope you won't blah blah

785
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
See you again

786
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,240
Yeah, I remember they work for us

787
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
Thank you very much Glenn

788
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,240
For reporting in on that

789
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,240
Sounds like a real mess

790
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,240
And man indeed only two more years until the big championships

791
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,240
Are being held in South Africa

792
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,240
Not good right now

793
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,240
I think it's 3 million

794
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,240
Foreigners have come in from other African countries

795
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,240
Oh, what a mess

796
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,240
Yeah, well we got a mess all over the place my friends

797
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,240
And certainly in the United States a lot is going on

798
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,240
And you know there is a call for a revolution

799
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,240
In my mind the revolution definitely is Dr. Ron Paul

800
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,240
Yeah, he may not be the Republican nominee

801
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,240
Remember he's only a heartbeat away from actually making a chance

802
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,240
But wow, do I want to thank Jeff Garlow for getting me a full blown version of

803
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,240
Amy Alex

804
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
Ron Paul Anthem

805
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
Wake up my friends

806
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,240

Wake up

We're in charge now

885
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
We're in charge now

886
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
We're in charge now

887

We're in charge now

889
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
We're in charge now

890
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
We're in charge now

891
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
We're in charge now

892
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
We're in charge now

We're in charge now

896
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:40,640
We haven't followed the constitution and now for what we are to be done.

897
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,240
The system that we have today are ripping off the middle class.

898
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,040
In your matches, I'll go to the nation we have if we didn't have the federal reserve system

899
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,040
printing on as money.

900
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,240
We're not gonna give up the fight.

901
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,240
We're not gonna give up the fight.

902
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
We're not gonna give up the fight.

903
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,240
We're not gonna give up the fight.

904
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,240
We're not gonna give up the fight.

905
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,240
We're not gonna give up the fight.

906
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,240

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,240

We're not gonna give up the fight.

911
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,240
It's all about the message, not about the man.

912
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,240
And Amy Ellen has really done a great job on this one.

913
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
The Ron Paul anthem.

914
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:01,240
Thank you very much again for getting me the high-res version of that man.

915
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,240
It's good.

916
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,240
I don't know if it's available on e-music.

917
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,240
I actually should have checked that would have been the first place to check.

918
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,240
I don't think of it.

919
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
I'll go and see if I can purchase it there.

920
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,240
Of course, you can also get a great deal from e-music.com slash daily source code.

921
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:22,240
You'll get 35 free MP3s with absolutely no obligation.

922
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,240
And of course, there's GoDaddy.

923
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,240
I've got my codes.

924
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,240
DSE1, DSE2, DSE3.

925
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,240
I'll give you a little bit different deal.

926
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,240
The one that most people seem to like as seem to use the most is DSE3.

927
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,240
You're gonna domain name for $6.95.

928
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,240
You can't get a cheaper anywhere else.

929
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,240
My friends, definitely gonna do a full bar Friday show tomorrow.

930
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,240
I'm in deep in the city doing all kinds of meetings.

931
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,240
So it'll be a three time show.

932
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,240
Actually, what I should do is I should try and keep the prostate cancer prevention code

933
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,240
on the same track as the number of shows I do each week.

934
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:58,240
And that will be motivated to get to my five to have a 60 to 70% reduction in prostate cancer.

935
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,240
Huh? In that good.

936
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,240
They work for us, my friends. Remember that.

937
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,240
We'll have a great food bar Friday.

938
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,240
It's just around the corner

939
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,240
and we'll get into the weekend.

940
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,240
Until then.

941
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,240
Leave your life with passion.

942
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,240
And enjoy your freedom.

943
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,240
Another fine, medium presentation.

944
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,240
Stick it in your ear.
