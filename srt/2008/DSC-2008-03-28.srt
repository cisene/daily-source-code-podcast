1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Politicking more, but being satisfied less.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Look no further.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
There's an answer.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There's a person who represents the masses.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Adam Curry for President.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So all you nerds,

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Jocs, heads out there.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
No matter if you're black, white, green or purple.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No matter if you dig girls, guys, or foreign animals.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There is a choice.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Adam Curry for President.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
One recent candidate at a $300 haircut.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's do a look like a cute doll,

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but not Adam Curry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He's been $294 less.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And just look at that hair.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Adam Curry for President.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Many politicians have been confused about their sexuality,

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but not Adam.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He can be called a big hair tag,

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and still say,

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Love you, no homo.

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Adam Curry for President.

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Conspiracy varies.

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Adam knows them all.

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Airport security issues.

29
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Then they're done that.

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Adam Curry for President.

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It is time we elect the people's president.

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Adam Curry for President.

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Great hair.

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He loves you.

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No homo.

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We hope he wins.

37
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Adam Curry for President.

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Delta's share in Charlie.

39
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
7-4.

40
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Zero.

41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
$16 million worth of airplay

42
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
strapped by us.

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Then the next generation rating content in my ears.

44
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We know how deep he can be.

45
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I like to think of slang each and each year.

46
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Just take this man curry.

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No daddy.

48
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Who stole my baby?

49
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Who died in me?

50
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Never wanted a grown-up shady.

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Who died in me?

52
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Who stole my girl from me?

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Who died in me?

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Who took my honey?

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Who died in me?

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Who?

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,800
Who got my place as you,

58
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,000
who killed your girl named Dinosett?

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Who died in me?

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Who died in me?

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Who died in me?

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Who died in me?

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Who died in me?

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Who died in me?

65
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Who died in me?

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Who died in me?

67
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Who died in me?

68
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
who died in me?

69
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Who died in me?

70
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Who died in me?

71
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Who died in me?

72
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Who died in me?

73
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Who died in me?

74
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Who died in me?

75
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Who died in me?

76
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Who died in me?

77
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Who died?

78
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Who died in me?

79
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Help me find those new ones, won't you?

80
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Where will you hold the night of the twelfth?

81
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I will smile myself, she went dancing in the light

82
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Somebody stole her pie, ever requealing in your soul

83
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Won't you help me find my sweet face?

84

And of course we're celebrating 25 years after the release of Thriller and you can hear my contribution to the festivities over Michael Jackson dot com slash podcast lots of

208
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,500
A really cool people outside of me who are dissipated that project. He just Molly mashed up seeing a music factory

209
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,200
Who with Michael Jackson's Billy Jean Justice for Billy Jean on the football our Friday episode number 740 and I'm gonna do a great show for you guys

210
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
You know why cuz I got something to make up for I

211
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,600
Rick rolled a lot of people earlier in the week was that after Wednesday's show and

212
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,300
Although the real thing was okay. I did fuck up one part of it. So I got to apologize because people are pissed on them

213
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
The fuck man

214
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:41,300
What's with the rolling rick thing it's a annoying my fire fox crashed and

215
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,300
You know luckily

216
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,800
It was more annoying than anything else, but

217
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Still man, what's with that don't don't give out the sight again remove that from the seed

218
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:05,600
This is annoying. Yeah, all right, so it wasn't so much the rick roll. I made the mistake of trying to put something into the show that would explain what the rick roll is

219
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,900
Excuse me, and so I googled rick rolling the rick rolled apostrophe D and

220
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,380
The top link I copied it and guess what that link was yeah

221
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,900
Not too good. Hey

222
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:27,660
JD here not much of one for leaving voice messages, but I had do man this special announcement on DSC yesterday

223
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,020
This browser

224
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:38,100
I jacked my machine it just me like 54 clicks could turn it off and then the link to it was to like adult friendfinders

225
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,460
Did you do this on purpose? What's with that?

226
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:47,580
Tell me please all right. I apologize. I did that that was not good the rick rolling thing

227
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,580
I think it worked out well, but I should have thought

228
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,540
Once or twice a month ending you guys that link interesting comments though

229
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:01,100
A number of people in the comments saying they're unsubscribing from the show fuck you Adam Curry and

230
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,260
One comment shown through was something it was relatively intelligent from Scott

231
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:11,940
I think some people had a sense of humor failure. He says it was completely trivial to kill off fire fox when I got bored with it

232
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,300
If that is what upset someone that much they have not been paying attention to what you've been saying recently

233
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:23,060
Yes, indeed if you're so angry about having to kill one browser session

234
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:28,020
How pissed off must you be about all the other things we discuss on this program?

235
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,580
You've got to be fucking livid anyway

236
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,220
From the rick roll to the Spanish stroll

237
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:42,060
Maximum music the food bar Friday from up salt the organization for the preservation to the soundtrack of our lives

238
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,340

239
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,980

240
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
This is 1977

241
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,740
Cut my fuel

242
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,340
Mr. Jim

243
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,140

244
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,780
finger on your eyebrows

245
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,980
And on your head

246
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,580
Think about just such a lady killer

247
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,900
Think it's so slick

248
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,860
Well, right

249
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,180
Brother Johnny he caught a plane and he got on it

250
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,260
Now he's a razor in the wind

251
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,180
And it's got a pistol in his pocket

252
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,860
This ain't the man it's crazy on the coast

253
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,460
Oh, there ain't no doubt about it

254
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,740
All right

255
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,460

256
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,700
And she said take the candles

257
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,820
And you're running down

258
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,820
Maybe the people

259
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,180
Lighted and sent it out

260
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,260
Oh

261
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,420
See that

262
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,420

263
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,420

264
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,780
But you make it at all

265
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,140
Yeah, I'm a rose to make a living

266
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,100
So you're right

267
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,380
Now I'm going to make a rose

268
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,380
I'm going to make a rose

269
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,740
I'm going to make a cake

270
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,380
And

271
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,380
Stake is a lot of rose

272
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,380

276
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,100
1977 compilation CD and rip some songs off it

277
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,100
It's the easiest way to prepare your footballer Friday

278
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,940
The Spanish stroll let's do a quick little freedom check how our things doing in the UK

279
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,260
In terms of the terms of the planes

280
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,660
I want to say they're random space and they're getting into station

281
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,540
I mean the

282
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,540
Isn't the super

283
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,020

00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,020
He's fast man and the last two

285
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,380

286
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,340
It's been so these fantastic and I'm now just in this later

287
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,580
Or the

288
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,100
Time to go for the British police

289
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,420
There you go

290
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,340
All right, looks like the freedom quotient is very low today in the United Kingdom

291
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,420
Although I have to say I did see a very good thing yesterday

292
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:22,060
The the London cops man and by the way these are not the Bobby's you see on television or in pictures

293
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:27,420
These are like massive dudes with some major hardware hanging around their bodies

294
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,020
They cleaned up an entire street of crime yesterday

295
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,860
I don't have the details so I don't want to you know pretend like I know what I'm talking about

296
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,700
But I saw I was all over the news last night. I'm like hell yeah hell yeah

297
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,540
Go kick some ass if people are not playing by the rules stop it. They can't fester

298
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:51,340
So I was very happy about that but unfortunately we still have all kinds of citizens being harassed everywhere in the United Kingdom

299
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,980
That will not stop

So it may be of interest to you that you're a new young

351
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,260
In case you didn't hear it, he said I'm an avator

352
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:15,100
I was a little tough to catch there because I'm an avator. I might be interested in knowing that the European

353
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,620
Union what?

354
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,620
On an USA have signed aviation pact

355
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:26,940
It's kind of akin to first sum which will lift a lot of restrictions on flying between

356
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,700
this tool and we can expect more flights more airlines flying

357
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,980
So simply cheaper tickets for flights between USA and European Union

358
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,380
It can be only good in it

359
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,940
You

360
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,500
That's true. That's right terminal five opened up

361
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,980
There would change the open skies agreement is now also in place

362
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,980
Lots of trouble with terminal five. This is the new eight billion dollar terminal they built

363
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,980
Which is being used exclusively. I believe by British airways

364
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,740
Oh man, so yesterday when it opened

365
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:07,260
The baggage handling blew up and that this happens with all these new airports the same happened in

366
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:14,380
Denver airport. I remember when that went down that I was just horrible and so people could actually fly with checked

367
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,500
baggage and today the problems continue although you can check your baggage in about 34 flights were canceled

368
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:25,020
That doesn't only have to do with the baggage problems I'm estimating because I was supposed to

369
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,580
I kind of call from Wing Commander William he said hey dude

370
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,420
The your annual inspection expires

371
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,540
the end of this month and the way that works is every year

372
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:40,380
Your aircraft has to be inspected it's a front-to-back they open up everything and you know and in fact

373
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,380
The Wing Commander does all my maintenance

374
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,380
He will open up the engine

375
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,300
Replace a whole bunch of things that are standard and he always looks at more than the standard stuff of course

376
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,620
And because it's the second

377
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,420
Every two years and this will be the the second year

378
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,100
All the instruments a altimeter air speed indicator

379
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,660
What else?

380
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:05,340
Peto systems everything has to be checked so it's a really big thing but if you don't get your annual done

381
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,340
your aircraft

382
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,340
Is essentially

383
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,140
Grounded because you can't fly without an annual inspection

384
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,420
For the insurance, but of course you can take off you can do whatever the hell you want but you're not insured

385
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,740
So this thing has to get there now please

386
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:25,020
Recognize that the weather has been so crap. We've got a ceiling of 800 feet

387
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:32,220
We've got heavy rain showers and even some hail no thunderstorms because the air is relatively stable

388
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,220
however the wind is

389
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,860
About 20 knots

390
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,820
Gusting up to 40 from the south so that's runway direction one a zero

391
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,740
Both in at fair Oaks and in Antwerp where to have to fly to

392
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,380
The runways are pretty much

393
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,340
Westernly runways a south south west but really closer to west like two four zero

394
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,940
And two nine or zero in Antwerp, which means the crosswind component would be

395
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,460
Well pretty much I could make the movie that we all saw

396
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,900
Of the plane of Germany

397
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,180
So decided not to fly today. Maybe we'll do that tomorrow

398
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,820
But I did predict and I knew that there would be a window coming up around one PM

399
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:21,820
And I was considering it because now it's just beautiful the sun came out and in about half an hour from now the rain and the hail will start coming down

400
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:29,100
And I knew that I would have I have a window to take off because the wind is blowing from the south and not from the west

401
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:35,660
I would still have to go through that odd that awesome front storm front basically over the north sea but this time so

402
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,820
Good idea not to do it and I'm even happier because that meant I can spend a lot of attention on the

403
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,820
Fubar Friday for you all today

404
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,700
Those of you who can't get on the live stream. I'm not quite sure what the problem is

405
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,660
It's happened to a couple of people

406
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,300
I'm you know this live through 65

407
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,460
gives you a total of

408
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:01,420
60 live listeners simultaneously and it seems like I'm exceeding that amount

409
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,060
It's like it's at 60 now

410
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:12,380
And it's at 58 and that goes back at 60 so I guess people are getting kicked off or people drop on drop off

411
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,620
Someone else comes in and that he can't get back on again

412
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:20,860
I'll investigate to see what we can do with upping that that amount. I know you can do it with live through 65

413
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:26,540
But I couldn't order that online you have to like facts stuff and it becomes a real pain in the ass

414
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,340
And honestly, I don't even know if it's really worth it or not

415
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,180
But dudes, do I have some great news from one of the chuckleheads?

416
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,420
That I've been dreaming of no no no, today we found out

417
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,060
My life is pregnant

418
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,180
Dude, I'm telling you I made a radical change in my life and it's pretty enough

419
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,180
And it is being

420
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,220
I'm walking on sunshine and everybody out there

421
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:10,460
afraid to make exchange you know for your heart if your heart tells you go just

422
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,860
Fucking do it

423
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Bye bye

424
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,940
Yeah, I told you I'm prepped this show

425
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,500
Congrats to sales giant you bet as wide

426
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,940
My soul down

427
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,940
Because I just can't wait till you hide me or call it a loud

428
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,220
Don't walk in on sunshine

429
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,540
Whoa, walk in on sunshine

430
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,940
Whoa, walk in on sunshine

431
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,180
Whoa, walk in on, sunshine

432
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,300
Oh, I'll ride it and South� θ

433
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,380
Do I feel better and go?

434
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,580
Hope that you'll make your love me !"

435
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,700
Now know that it's true

436
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,900
But if someone starts to roam my whole life just go ahead and hold you

437
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:41,980
No, don't want you back for the weekend, not back for a day

438
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,100
No, no music

439
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,760
Can maybe I just won't you back if ever, don't feel stated

440
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,520
Yeah, I want you no second time

441
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,880
I've won't be no second time

442
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,540
Wow, Okay no second time

443
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,020
Way to go, it's time to feel good

444
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:37,020
Hey, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

445
00:27:37,020 --> 00:28:07,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

446
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,020
على Benmalcy

447
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,580
hey and and you begin also

448
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,080
hey by the way I just had a nice Sy races

449
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,540
to know What that is

450
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,580
at the

451
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,660
The Lady 3, she was in the theater half-today.

452
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:45,380
Inter-touching husband, you know she talks about living in jail for an older,

453
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:50,260
an older little piece of bearish, but I read that you might be moving for London.

454
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,100
You might be moving for London.

455
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,860
And if the Lady tells you that you're moving to London at him,

456
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,500
my friends, you are moving to London.

457
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,180
That's just a way, it is.

458
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,580
I don't know who I'd come.

459
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,580
I don't know who I'd come.

460
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,580
That's the currenty source, I don't know.

461
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:22,580
I don't know.

462
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,580
Take a car, sir, or solve the way.

463
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,580
Money, money, money, money.

464
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,580
I'll ever hear these days.

465
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,580
Every song that the DJ plays.

466
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,580
Talking about similar situations.

467
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,580
Two weeks to rock and rock is a point.

468
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,580
I've got to get some.

469
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,580
I've got to have more than I had before.

470
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,580
I've got to have more than the man next door.

471
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,580
Every day I've got to make some awesome awesome.

472
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,580
Another £2,000 cast by your stove in my life.

473
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,580
That's what I need.

474
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,580
Time out.

475
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:18,580
Now I've been taking limos and different forms of upper-scale transportation since I was

476
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,580
on a 19.

477
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,580
Didn't do anything if I didn't for money.

478
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,580
I love her that way.

479
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,580
So I think she's going to be buying our daughter a new car.

480
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,580
I would sit and coach if she was giving the demonstration.

481
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,580
I would sacrifice all of that, all of that.

482
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Hey everybody, my name's Adam Curry.

483
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,580
And I'm so full of shit.

484
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,580
We stayed in the Nae Flower Hotel for the first, I think, six weeks.

485
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,580
We just got to get some.

486
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,580
I've got to have more than I had before.

487
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,580
I've got to have more than the man next door.

488
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,580
Every day I've got to make some awesome awesome.

489
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,580
Give me a break.

490
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,580
Yeah.

491
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Let me just pinch time out.

492
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,580
We've got a fruit.

493
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,580
I've got a fruit.

494
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,580
I've got a fruit.

495
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,580
I've got a fruit.

496
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,580
I've got a fruit.

497
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,580
Give me a fruit.

498
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,580
Yeah.

499
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,580
Let me take some time out.

500
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,580
Wow.

501
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,580
Okay.

502
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,580
I guess I'm just a money-grubbing whore.

503
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,580
It just goes to show.

504
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,580
Appreciate all the work on that remix.

505
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,580
And not only do I have older listeners who hate me talking about money.

506
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580
I got younger listeners too.

507
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,580
I'm Billy I'm here from U.S.

508
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,580
Just listening to the D.S.C. from yesterday.

509
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,580
And I heard you talking about your demographics again.

510
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,580
And I'm a pretty young guy.

511
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,580
I just thought I'd give you a voice here.

512
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,580
I'm in IT.

513
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,580
And I kind of got turned on to you from all the D.S.C.

514
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,580
I think you're getting a lot of his trans as well.

515
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,580
I started in with no agenda and moved to the SD now.

516
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,580
I've actually got four of the guys around our office here.

517
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,580
On it too.

518
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,580
Love you.

519
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,580
Love everything about it.

520
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,580
No homo there.

521
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,580
And keep up the financial stuff.

522
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,580
That's good information.

523
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,580
That's does everybody needs to know.

524
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,580
Great hair.

525
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,580
Hope you went.

526
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,580
All right man.

527
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,580
Well, a couple things on the financial tip.

528
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,580
And I'm sure I'll be talking about this with John C. Dvorak.

529
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,580
Maybe today or over the weekend for Noah gender.

530
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,580
And I really appreciate you tuning in and getting the guys in the office to listen.

531
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,580
That of course is the only reason why I put up with the guy is I just want to steal his audience.

532
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,580
The financial services authority in the United Kingdom have admitted,

533
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,580
admitted actually previously in the week.

534
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:52,580
They didn't really pay that good attention to what was going on with Northern Rock.

535
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,580
Oh my goodness.

536
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,580
No kidding.

537
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,580
No shit.

538
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,580
Yeah.

539
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,580
I got tipped off to this movie called The Money Makers.

540
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,580
And you can find it at Google Video.

541
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,580
And it's really is going to be homework for over the weekend.

542
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,580
The money makers.

543
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,580
You can just Google it at video.google.com.

544
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,580
It's a three and a half hour movie.

545
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,580
But it explains how the banking system was set up.

546
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,580
It explains the history, the genesis of it.

547
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,580
Which includes the Bank of England.

548
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,580
Okay.

549
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,580
Sorry stop.

550
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,580
The Bank of England and the Federal Reserve.

551
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,580
And once you, because it's so incredibly simple to understand what's going on.

552
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,580
It is so easy.

553
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:46,580
And actually I think the past six months or so that I've been talking about what's going on with finances in the world.

554
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,580
And who really runs the world.

555
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,580
Okay.

556
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,580
The Roth child's people like this.

557
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,580
JP Morgan Chase.

558
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,580
But really those families.

559
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:01,580
They run the world because they lend money to your government.

560
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,580
They lend the money.

561
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,580
Your government does not print it.

562
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,580
These guys do.

563
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,580
These families do.

564
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,580
So please, I'll put a link in the show notes.

565
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,580
You have to check this out.

566
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,580
It is your homework.

567
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,580
It's of the utmost importance that you understand.

568
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,580
And then the light will go on.

569
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:19,580
You will find out you're being ripped the fuck off.

570
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,580
Peter.

571
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,580
I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out.

572
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,580
You're on her.

573
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,580
Please don't bang that gavel.

574
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,580
You can try this cowbell out.

575
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,580
Let's don't give a nod.

576
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,580
To the hardest work in law here.

577
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,580
It's Jersey.

578
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,580
It's Jersey.

579
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,580
It's Jersey.

580
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,580
Oh yeah.

581
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,580
You're on her.

582
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,580
What do you say?

583
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,580
Yo.

584
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,580
How's it going out?

585
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,580
It's Jersey time.

586
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,580
The official musical.

587
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,580
There's a lot of shot shot.

588
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,580
So today my buddy Ron from the Jersey Jamcast.

589
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,580
Samuel Alon said that men without pants is on the pot saved music.

590
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,580
Now we're kind of like, no without pants.

591
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,580
That's cool.

592
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,580
You know, they did that song.

593
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,580
You know, we can answer.

594
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,580
We want to, we can leave us up.

595
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,580
Anyway, it turns out little no no fact.

596
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,580
It's not men without pants that did that song.

597
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,580
That band was men without hats.

598
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,580
No, no, no.

599
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,580
Men without pants absolutely rocks.

600
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,580
They've a band, a brand new album coming out on May 27, 2008.

601
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,580
The album's called Naturally.

602
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,580
But it's featuring such artists as Cibomato, Sean Lenin,

603
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,580
members of the gay, yeah, yes.

604
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,580

I'll be honest with you when I was previewing this offering from Sir Jersey Todd for the

670
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:53,140
footballer Friday festivities I was yelling back at him saying no no no safety dance was

672
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:06,500
never without pants from the pod save music network thanks to our official music

673
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:11,700
ecologist of the Charlie Sir Jersey Todd hey you know if you have a blog or if you've

674
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,780
been online and you've been posting your thoughts I'm sure that you have people who

675
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,780
will email you from time to time and this is really enriched my life there's a whole bunch of

676
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:24,420
people that I talk to I don't really talk to him but all over the world who send me comments

677
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,340
and links and ideas and you start to recognize these people and the value of what they're

678
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:32,180
sending you one of the people who has been following me for a long time is a guy from

679
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:39,140
Holland called the limonatumum and he has always been I think since I started blogging in the

680
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:47,140
Netherlands early 2000s even though I was blogging way before that but I didn't start blogging

681
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,940
in Dutch until then and of course I stopped when when I left the country and he sent an

682
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,940
invoice comment I think this is one of the first ones ever he'll call himself he'll identify

683
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:00,260
himself as the lemonade man because that is the direct translation of the limonatumum I have no

684
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:05,780
idea who he is well actually after listening to this contribution he sent in I do have a better

685
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:13,380
idea and I like him hi this is the lemonade man I've been following you very closely since the

686
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:19,540
days he were busy with so-called meeting points inside a company called KGB I think that later on

687
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:25,540
became weblogging but I'm not sure it's it's so long ago yeah that was a company I had in the Netherlands

688
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:34,980
KGB was a cool name it stood for geyser's kracht brake bond I think was KGB E geyser's kracht brake

689
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:40,420
bond entertainment something like that it wasn't obviously the Russian spy organization anyway since

690
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:47,220
you started a weblogging I've been reading every single post until you started the DC from

691
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:55,300
which I hardly missed an episode and in the past two weeks I've been listening through over

692
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:00,740
all the episodes and the stupid comments that I've heard in those was the guy who shouted that

693
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:08,900
you have changed you have not you now support Ron Paul and like many you discover to be a

694
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:18,020
favor of a republic repubric as you can hear my native language is not English by the way

695
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:22,820
don't worry about it dude your vocabulary is outstanding your accent is fantastic

696
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:27,700
fuck it I got you a republican no worries keep it rock and because I'm from the Netherlands

697
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:34,340
where you also lived and a few years ago have joined the socialistic party another member of

698
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:40,260
that very same party is Derek Sauer formerly head editor of the new era food and today owner of

699
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:47,460
a big publisher in a big country russia and needless to mention also so freeing an overdose of

700
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:54,980
wealth being a socialist and millionaire seems to be a contradiction to many well let me just

701
00:41:54,980 --> 00:42:00,500
explain how I became a member of the Dutch socialist party for those you don't know the story

702
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:05,220
I had the the leader of the Dutch socialist party on a radio show when I was living in the

703
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:12,100
Netherlands I loved this guy he's a salt of the earth down and dirty get it get the shit done red

704
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:20,660
malbrose smoking unbutton you know shirt wearin guy who gets a done young marania and I had him on the

705
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:26,660
show and this was and actually this party is exploded in growth recently so yeah this is not like the

706
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:32,980
red book mail you know town type of people and there's a lot of shit I don't agree with but

707
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,900
you know you would invite me to strategy meetings and stuff like that and I had him on the show

708
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,060
and I said you know dude I'll tell you what you should be web logging you would be awesome I think

709
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:46,500
it'd be great at it he said I don't know you know the web logging wasn't certainly wasn't

710
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:52,180
hadn't proliferated that much in the Netherlands at the time and he was like I don't know I said dude

711
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,820
I'll make a deal with you if you weblog if you start web logging and start posting shit I'll

712
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:01,860
become a member of your damn party and he did and I went to the haga went to the government

713
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:08,180
you know parliament and you know I had a chat with him and his ICT people and he said he

714
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,180
do it if I would become a member of the party so hell yeah I'll do that I support you he has

715
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:17,540
been web logging I think now for three or four you know four years straight seven days a week

716
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:22,580
and his party is they could have been in the in the coalition to rule other Netherlands but

717
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,820
they decided not to because well they really didn't want to work with the people who are now

718
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:31,620
in the majority so he's in the opposition so that's how that started but of course I do have my

719
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:38,340
own philosophy about what socialism actually means I quote him socially you are not against

720
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:43,460
well but you are against poverty exact and I don't know you any different than that you can

721
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:49,460
actually wind up about tiny things if they are fair to whoever especially if they are

722
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:56,740
in the dark and same for privacy just like auto prograp you are totally aware and warning

723
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:02,580
that you cannot take for granted that the future government is and always will be reliable

724
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:09,780
reliable reliable and honest and therefore you cannot do data mining and privacy released of

725
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:18,100
DNA data banks and biomedical characteristics stuff that's going on right now

726
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:24,420
Rob Saro who I've mentioned with this countless revolutions in several countries

727
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:31,380
do you came may may get one if someone says up and Holland will also get one have a look at

728
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:39,460
folks up on the 2018 0 and I think but I'm not sure the Pirate Party is co-organizer

729
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:45,300
it's a party who happened to be big and Scandinavia but are not getting that much attention of the

730
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:53,300
media maybe because there are one issue party but still they I've been told that they are big

731
00:44:53,940 --> 00:45:00,020
and they're being harassed majorly by governmental organizations in different countries who

732
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:07,140
thus are not to be that I will send you a link of the manifestive party I don't know them that

733
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:13,460
well but as you happen to have many listeners in Scandinavia I'm curious if someone can tell

734
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:19,060
something about it I will do the closing protocol next time because my remblings is already

735
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:29,220
taken to law by the closing protocol a limonot a lot of stuff and I really appreciate you calling

736
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:34,260
in and I will take a look at the Pirate Party and what I enjoyed about this so basically there's

737
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:38,340
a couple of organizations in the Netherlands who are standing up and saying enough of this

738
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:44,500
enough of this spying on this enough of you know tracking us listening in a boy the Netherlands

739
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:50,500
you want to talk about phone taps it's out of control this is bad as it is in the US right now

740
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:56,580
unbelievably enough so yeah I'll definitely take a look at it and endorse anything I can

741
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:02,260
if if I obviously agree with it a lot of people complaining about life 365 you know I think

742
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,340
what they're trying to do these guys and supposing me off is they're trying to get you to

743
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:11,540
sign up to become a VIP which costs money and then you have guaranteed you know pipe to listen to

744
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:17,460
the shows and I'm not too happy about that but we'll just we'll just leave that for what it is

745
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:21,860
it being the food war I got to get back to the music I had this song cute up because I was hoping

746
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,900
that I would time it just right so that I could play the song as the hail and the rain started

747
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:31,780
flowing from the heavens above but it's not quite here but we can still enjoy the song we've

748
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:43,060
the living on the football Friday it's funny how the smile in your eyes slowly fading with the last days

749
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:55,060
in July the year is drowning like the calendar rose thin and set away again your back against the wind

750
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:05,940
and I'll call in though your gone and I will hold my head again

751
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:13,940
but you can run around the truth

752
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:27,940
the running rain

753
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:39,140
some beaches my world is cold and weak and trust me flowers and pages of the fire is your key

754
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:44,820
it's the old filns by the sign these beautiful heels

755
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,940
I can't help sending your feelings

756
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:39,140
I love you, me, you, me, you, me, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

757
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:53,640
boy, you do, you, you like this eye of the Lord, no, no, you, you, too you too, oh, oh, thanks for having fun again, good night, bup.

758
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:05,440
Oh, my love this song, oh, my love this song, oh, my love this song. I now have played in earlier in the way for just ahead to roll it out again for yet, it is pod save, but we're leaving, we're not leaving.

759
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:12,360
coming soon to a UK suburb near you. Okay, time to get a little heavy on your

760
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:17,520
ass today because yesterday, here's builders, the leader of the PVV party and

761
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,560
the Netherlands, released his anti-Koran anti Islam movie. It's 15 minutes and

762
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:29,440
it's titled Fittna. It's Fittna the movie and you can just Google it. It's

763
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:34,240
been uploaded and made it from places including live leak. I think is what

764
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,880
they ultimately chose is the place to upload it. And I got some comments on this

765
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,160
movie. The good news, of course, is that Europe didn't burn down. The Netherlands

766
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:49,040
did not burn down. But I don't think that this, in fact, I think it's showed the

767
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,640
issues of the multicultural society. Oh, by the way, I want to thank

768
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,240
you make a New York who sent me a tweet. I made a mistake. It's not the

769
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,880
money makers. It's the money masters. That's your homework for this weekend.

770
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,040
The money masters Google that wanted video Google. Thanks to you, making

771
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,160
New York. So, let's talk about multicultural society for a second because this

772
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:15,640
was really the main topic, the main point of what he had Villars is saying and

773
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,840
he's one of the few politicians that I know of in Europe saying that this is

774
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:24,440
just not working. And the multicultural society is horseshit when politicians

775
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,640
talk about it. This is the same thing Pat Kondell was saying, who was the guy in

776
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,640
Britain. And we'll talk about him a little bit more in a second as well. First

777
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,040
to comment about this multicultural society, although not in Europe.

778
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,640
Hey, they're Adam. This is Steve Saler from Ontario, Canada. I want to actually

779
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,920
comment in regards to the YouTube video you play the other day about on the SC738

780
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,640
about multiculturalism in Islam. But the first one for Oregon to that demographics. I'm

781
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,640
24. I'm a college student. I'm studying radio broadcasting here in Ontario, Canada.

782
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:59,040
I am in Albano. Yes, a full-fledged Albano. Oh, cool. Oh, man.

783
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:04,040
I mean, naked pictures. You are now the official Albano of the Charlie, my friend.

784
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:08,040
I don't care what you say. Only Albano and podcasting as well as I know. Yes.

785
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,040
I'm at Steve Saler.net. If you want to check me out, also a podcast novel called

786
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:16,040
Black Shadow, if you want to check that out as well. I have to disagree with you on the

787
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:21,540
comment you made on DC738 about multiculturalism society being full of shit. I actually did

788
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:26,040
have to look up the episode to get that exact words. I had to disagree with you on that

789
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:30,040
one. Obviously being Canadian, multiculturalism is actually a way of life here.

790
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:35,040
We're known as obviously the mosaic country. And we're a little bit more

791
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,040
lax as far as allowing anyone from any walk of life and religion to be a Canadian.

792
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:45,040
And we accept that. There's actually it's kind of funny. I live in a city where

793
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,040
even Islam, there's a large community of Muslims here. And they're very progressive.

794
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:54,040
I mean, I have several friends who are Muslim. I'm a Christian. Believe it or not.

795
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:59,040
So it's kind of funny. And we accept that. Now, I know then in today's society and

796
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:04,040
regards to media hype that Islam seems to be synonymous with terrorism these days.

797
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:09,040
But there's actually kind of a funny TV show that's actually on CTV that kind of deals

798
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,040
with that situation. There's actually it's called Little Mosque on the Prairie.

799
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,040
It's on CTV. It's sending a link in the email with this comment.

800
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,040
But it's about a show that about a group of community of Muslims living in the

801
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:27,040
prairies of Canada, being a part of small town life and kind of dealing with stereotypes

802
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:32,040
about the fact that Muslims are considered terrorists or something like that. And we kind of

803
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:36,040
deal with that obviously in a very funny community way. But it just kind of goes to show

804
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:41,040
that we're a more accepting, we're guys to many different walks of life. Now, I know you

805
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,040
agree that yes, the people should live the way they want to live in any country they

806
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:51,040
want to live. And I'm obviously totally for that. But I have to say multiculturalism

807
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,040
here in Canada. It's not full of shit. It's definitely right up there as far as

808
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:01,040
the high priorities of living in this country. So anyway, that's a little bit

809
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,040
I want to go over further. But obviously I know you want to keep at least

810
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,040
comments short. If you want me to be a Canadian savant, I can definitely

811
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:14,040
to my Duke to that A. Hey, you are the Albino savant, my friend. So to speak.

812
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:18,040
I can comment a little bit more about that in the future episodes if you like.

813
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:23,040
Anyway, that's it for me. I love you. I mean it. No homo. Great hair. Hope you

814
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:29,040
win. Blah, blah, blah, blah, red bill. Whatever. As always, I remain

815
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,040
obediently yours. Yeah, all right. Okay. So I'm starting to

816
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,040
form an opinion about this stuff. First of all, I watched this movie, this

817
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,040
fitness movie. And you should definitely check it out.

818
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:42,040
Lincoln's show notes. Of course, a daily source code.com. I don't

819
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:46,040
think the reason why there was no blood in the streets is because this

820
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:50,040
was, well, it wasn't a very well done movie. It was kind of like every other

821
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,040
conspiracy movie that's out there that's been edited put together from

822
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:58,040
multiple sources. But they didn't even have a scary guy doing a scary

823
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:02,040
voiceover. It was all subtitles because there was a lot of stuff that

824
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,040
had to be translated. But the premise of the movie is there are a

825
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,040
whole bunch of there's verbiage in the Quran that basically says

826
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,040
if you're a, if you don't believe in a lie, if you don't believe in

827
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:18,040
Islam, you should be killed. All kinds of nasty stuff like that.

828
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:24,040
And what this movie did is it took you through all those different

829
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,040
pieces and things like 10 different topics throughout the 15

830
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:34,040
minute duration of this flick. And so to take the words from the

831
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,040
Quran translated, I presume correctly, and then would show you how

832
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:42,040
this lives on today and how it is still taking place.

833
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,040
And a lot of a Dutch newspaper headlines. So I really

834
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,040
believe that this was in line. This was not meant as the

835
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,040
Dutch prime minister, young painter Balkan and has been

836
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,040
stating on the public stage, this movie was only meant to be

837
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:02,040
hurtful towards Islam. That's not true. What he was saying

838
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,040
and it's hard for anyone to judge, but people living in the Netherlands.

839
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,040
What he was saying was, no, no, no, all this stuff, all these

840
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,040
are just the law. Sharrya law, et cetera. It's taking place in our country.

841
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,040
And we need to stop it, because it's not our culture. So that's where this

842
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,040
whole multicultural piece comes into it. Now for my Al Gainau

843
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,040
friend in Canada, it's a little different, because you

844
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:28,040
want a continent, the North American continent, and people,

845
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,040
the only way they can really get. There's through an official

846
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:34,040
port, alright? And it's much harder. It's a much further

847
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,880
distance from the dog is not helping today.

848
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,320
A much further distance to travel to get there.

849
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,080
So there's a whole other set of decisions

850
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:47,240
that have to be made before you enter Canada.

851
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:51,160
Here in Europe, dude, especially in the Netherlands,

852
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:57,160
you can get in a fucking car in Iraq, in Pakistan.

853
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,680
And any of these countries, and you can drive.

854
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,160
It'll take you a day.

855
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,680
And you can drive into any other European country

856
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,920
further in West.

857
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,640
And there's hardly any borders on the road.

858
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:16,280
You can go from France, to Belgium, to the Netherlands,

859
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,680
easy.

860
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,040
So it's more about immigration.

861
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,680
This is, and of course right now, the people who

862
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,280
seem to be immigrating into West Western Europe

863
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,160
are predominantly Muslims.

864
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,040
That's most of the population coming in.

865
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,480
A million Muslims in the Netherlands now,

866
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,480
out of a overpopulated country of 16, which is the 16 million,

867
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,880
which is the size of Rhode Island.

868
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:41,520
So you can see where there's a culture clash.

869
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,520
The cultures are not getting along together.

870
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,800
There are Muslim ghettos in the Netherlands.

871
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,480
The country with the tulips and the flowers

872
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,960
and the free sex and the free weed.

873
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,240
I mean, there's real honest to God, ghettos.

874
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,880
And not the way you might imagine a ghetto,

875
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,080
but ghettos where there is no Dutch culture.

876
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,680
It's just not a good thing.

877
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,640
So anyway, you should look at that movie.

878
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,480
What I wanted to play for you was an interview

879
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,000
with Heard Villers in Denmark.

880
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,600
And there's another interview I want to play right after that,

881
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,760
which is an interview that we're actually a piece

882
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,120
from a CNN.

883
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,920
Just to give you the difference in intelligence,

884
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,920
in journalism, because this will blow your mind

885
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,920
when you hear how stupid it is in the US.

886
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,480
So of course, Denmark had what they call the cartoon crisis.

887
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,840
When they printed, some not so flattering cartoons of Allah

888
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,640
and or Muhammad, I'm sorry.

889
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,240
And there was an uprising and there was all kinds of crap going on

890
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,680
and writing in the streets.

891
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,480
So these guys know what they're talking about.

892
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,200
And the woman, I don't know her name.

893
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,680
And even I knew what I wouldn't be able to pronounce her

894
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,520
probably.

895
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,840
Who is interviewing Wilders, Wilders, is just she has great questions.

896
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,080
But also listen to what Wilders is saying.

897
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,440
Listen to what the man is about.

898
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,000
And then we'll hear how his messages interpreted

899
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
in the United States.

900
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
And it'll just make you want to poop in your pants.

901
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,040
So you can fast forward if you're not interested.

902
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,680
In fact, if you're not interested, unsubscribe from the show.

903
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,000
Because I think you will be interested.

904
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,280
Check it out.

905
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,120
Heard Villers being interviewed on Danish television.

906
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,240
Mr. Villers, who is your film mate for the Dutch audience

907
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,840
or an international audience?

908
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,320
Well, it's made especially for the Dutch audience.

909
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:37,120
But I know now a lot of people around the world

910
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,960
will want to see the short movie I made.

911
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,800
So.

912
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,920
But the point to making is the Dutch point.

913
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,120
Well, not only Dutch in a way.

914
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,840
I made it for the Dutch public, but I really

915
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,640
believe that it's five minutes to 12.

916
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,920
And it comes to the danger of the Islamization

917
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,600
of our continent of Europe.

918
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,040
Indeed, of the Western world.

919
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,720
So I hope that the Dutch would also

920
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:01,240
the Western world will look at it and acknowledge the fact

921
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,560
that you have a big problem when it comes to defending

922
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,880
a freedom when it comes to the growing Islamization

923
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,600
of our continent.

924
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,480
You have said that you want the Quran to be forbidden.

925
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,320
Why?

926
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,640
Yes, I think it's a freshest book.

927
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,280
I think Dr. Moran, which is Islam,

928
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:21,960
it's the word of God, only brings a lot of attention

929
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:22,800
in our countries.

930
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,360
It's a violent book.

931
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,760
It's a book that at the end of the day

932
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,520
will cost us our freedom.

933
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,760
It's a book of submission.

934
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,360
And you could also find places in the Bible,

935
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,160
for instance, where they can don't stoning,

936
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,200
where they say that homosexuality

937
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,120
you should have death penalty for that.

938
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,720
That's also very hard to talk.

939
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,960
Yes, it is indeed.

940
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,560
But of course, after the Old Testament

941
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,440
that you're talking about the thoronium

942
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,400
and other parts of the Old Testament,

943
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,080
we had a new Testament, new Testament is a more moderate book.

944
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,520
The Quran is not only the word of God directly,

945
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,520
giving through Muhammad, but Muslims believe

946
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,720
as the word of God.

947
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:01,440
But there is not a new moderate Quran today.

948
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,000
And I would wish that would be the case.

949
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,560
How is that what you want to obtain a reform of Islam?

950
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,440
Is that what you wish?

951
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,560
Well, I don't believe myself on a short term

952
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:13,640
that I would be a moderate Islam or a European Islam.

953
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,760
I think that the Islam, it will take many, many years

954
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:17,760
if there would be a change.

955
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,760
But indeed, a new moderate Quran in time

956
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,720
would be very good.

957
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,560
I make a distinction, however, between the religion,

958
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,240
the ideology, I think we should fight the Islamic ideology,

959
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,800
which will kill at the end of the day,

960
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,360
our freedom and our values and the Muslims.

961
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,520
I think that a lot of Muslims indeed

962
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,960
and our countries are not terrorists.

963
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,360
But there are so many that they bring their culture,

964
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,760
which should stop at least the immigration

965
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,120
from people from Muslim countries to the West.

966
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,320
So I don't understand this.

967
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,280
Is the number of Muslims the important thing

968
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,720
or is it the ideology of the few?

969
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,040
Hey, it's the ideology, but be it's also the numbers.

970
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,400
I don't want any Muslims in the Netherlands

971
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,720
to leave my country unfaluntarily.

972
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,320
But I want the immigration to be stopped

973
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,320
because if you have, like my country,

974
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,120
out of 16 million inhabitants, 1 million Muslims,

975
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,960
they bring that culture, that is so different

976
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,840
to our culture, that at the end of the day,

977
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,800
there will not only be a class of civilizations

978
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,720
that we have today, but we would lose as Dutchmen,

979
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,400
or as Danish or as other Western European countries,

980
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,800
our identity, the way we deal with women

981
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,800
with gay, with separation, of church and state.

982
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,760
So I want the immigration to be stopped

983
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,920
from Muslim countries because I believe

984
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,240
that we should be more proud of our own identity,

985
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,080
our own culture.

986
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,400
And once again, the Netherlands, like Denmark,

987
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,680
is not and should never become in Muslim state.

988
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,520
But the vast majority of the Muslims

989
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,960
don't even want that.

990
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,240
The vast majority of the Muslims do not like

991
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,880
beheading stonings, all this.

992
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,360
They live modern integrated lives

993
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,960
in your country and in my countries.

994
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:52,520
I wish you were right, but we had just a poor academic

995
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,760
poll in the Netherlands, and it proved that almost half,

996
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,200
48% of the Moroccan youth,

997
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,440
all Moroccan's under the age of 21,

998
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,040
said that they were against democracy

999
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,640
and in favor of installing Sharia.

1000
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,640
But in fact, a fact of educational is that

1001
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,840
lack of your country not educating these people

1002
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:09,800
in the right way?

1003
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,560
Well, we don't educate people to be in favor of Sharia.

1004
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:17,280
If people want the Sharia to be installed in the Netherlands,

1005
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,800
they should get out of our country.

1006
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,600
We should kick them out and let them go.

1007
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,400
Poor Sharia, that they're in the right way.

1008
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,080
Show them in your education system.

1009
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,560
And that's not the way we live here.

1010
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,360
You have to live the way.

1011
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,120
We are doing that.

1012
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:30,240
Once again, almost all of those people are born in the Netherlands.

1013
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,680
They are not the last third generation living in the Netherlands.

1014
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,240
They are not like in the 60s people coming from Morocco

1015
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:36,840
to the Netherlands.

1016
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,000
They are born here.

1017
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,640
They are educated here.

1018
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:43,960
God knows we have no Sharia in our educational system.

1019
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,040
They know it's not acceptable and still almost half

1020
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,080
of them once the democracy to be changed.

1021
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,280
We cannot accept it.

1022
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,440
This is something that is so much against all our failures.

1023
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,480
That I believe we should stop all the Islamization

1024
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,680
of all our countries at the end of the day.

1025
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,160
The whole world is now waiting for you to be published.

1026
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,920
And no one really knows what it's in it.

1027
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,960
But it looks like the world could go on fire

1028
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,600
and you're the one holding the match.

1029
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:11,160
Well, what are the reactions you expect?

1030
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,240
Listen, I'm more than half a million people

1031
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,680
voted for me personally and for my party.

1032
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,880
I'm a democratic elected politician.

1033
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,400
I believe that my movies were in the boundaries of the Dutch law

1034
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,040
and I don't really care about the contents of the Saudi

1035
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,080
or the Afghan law.

1036
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,240
So what do you most people think about the threat

1037
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,920
to Dutch soldiers abroad, reactions to your country's

1038
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,440
exports, reactions to Dutch people living in other countries?

1039
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,440
You must be thinking about that.

1040
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,600
Of course, but I will never, never accept responsibility

1041
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,560
for people who don't care about the rule of law

1042
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,520
and use instead of counter arguments

1043
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,400
for something they perhaps don't agree with like my movie,

1044
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,720
will use violence, will use hate, will use murder

1045
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,200
of threats to anybody, any Dutch men or even any Danish people

1046
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,320
like your experience abroad on countries.

1047
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:02,200
I'm a Democrat, making a movie within the Dutch law,

1048
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,920
the boundaries of a law, and people who don't accept the law

1049
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,200
and use violence, they are responsible.

1050
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,440
They are responsible for the data that can never be me

1051
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,600
who is being held responsible.

1052
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,320
It proves my point that indeed Islam

1053
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,560
is a very violent religion.

1054
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,720
If I would have made a movie about the Bible,

1055
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,080
I'm sure that not everything would have happened,

1056
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,880
that there wouldn't be threats from the Vatican

1057
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,560
that are coming now from Pakistan and the Mofti

1058
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,120
of Lebanon that threats to me and my country,

1059
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,960
fellow countrymen, this proves my point exactly

1060
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,040
about Islam and how much the movie is needed.

1061
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,040
And talk about the reactions we're expecting abroad.

1062
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,400
If we see violent demonstrations, things happening,

1063
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,120
that we also saw happening after the Danish cartoon crisis,

1064
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,080
is that what you wish to obtain?

1065
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:48,520
Of course not, I don't want to be any hassle

1066
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:51,040
in any part of the world, but it can happen.

1067
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,840
Like happens with the Danish cartoons cartoon.

1068
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,720
But you know, for fact, now what could happen?

1069
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,120
We didn't know that was the cartoon.

1070
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,360
You know that this will be happening.

1071
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:01,480
It's happening already now, whereas nobody in the world

1072
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,520
knows what the content of the movie will be.

1073
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,720
They already Dutch flags burning and people saying

1074
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:10,000
that perhaps the Dutch soldiers in Afghanistan

1075
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
would be hurt.

1076
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,800
But of course, I can never.

1077
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:17,120
And I will never go to bow for people who

1078
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,560
used threats and violence, who are just

1079
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,200
using my freedom of expression.

1080
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,400
And I'm very proud that when it came to the Danish cartoons,

1081
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,160
your Danish government stood behind the freedom

1082
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,520
of expression of anybody.

1083
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,080
Leftish writers, middle of the road, it doesn't matter.

1084
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,240
The freedom of expression is important.

1085
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,960
And even if it means setting the world of place?

1086
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,280
Well, if the world is going to be set up

1087
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:43,040
in place, it's been done by radical Muslims, not by me.

1088
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,320
Mr. Willows, thank you so much.

1089
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,680
That's my question.

1090
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:49,400
I really enjoyed that because this guy, this

1091
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,600
is not the message you're reading anywhere.

1092
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,120
This is really the message.

1093
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,200
And I find it fascinating because I believe

1094
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,440
this to be true in many Western European countries

1095
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,880
is that we're now looking at a third generation

1096
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,800
of, in this case, Dutch kids.

1097
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,000
Dutch kids.

1098
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,880
OK, because if you're born in the Netherlands,

1099
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,920
you're Dutch.

1100
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:17,400
A third generation, yet half of them want democracy to end

1101
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,640
and things like Sharia Law to be implemented.

1102
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,480
That is where the idea of the multicultural society

1103
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,360
breaks down.

1104
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,640
And he's not saying throw people out.

1105
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:32,160
He's saying stop the Islamization of Western Europe.

1106
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,840
Because it doesn't fit.

1107
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,680
It is not our culture.

1108
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,560
It's just not.

1109
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,720
Oh, man.

1110
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,400
OK, so this is a big, big stuff, right?

1111
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,720
Really, really heavy.

1112
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,800
And it's really an immigration issue if anything.

1113
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,240
OK, again, the Netherlands is the size of Rhode Island.

1114
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,160
It already has 16 million inhabitants of those

1115
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:55,760
1 million have immigrated.

1116
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:56,840
Now that's not entirely true.

1117
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,000
Less than 1 million, I'm sure.

1118
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,240
There's a lot of them.

1119
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,840
No, fuck, I don't know.

1120
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,440
A lot, OK.

1121
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,160
But now listen to how this very serious topic

1122
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:12,800
is discussed by Glenn Beck on CNN, the news channel,

1123
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,840
the proper journalistic channel.

1124
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:19,000
Please, this will blow your mind when you listen

1125
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,400
to the ignorance of this guy, which is not just him.

1126
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,720
It's represented throughout journalism in the United

1127
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,280
States.

1128
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,920
He's to build this crap.

1129
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,600
This one I meant to hit sorry.

1130
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,520
Well, the internet is like a wild west, right?

1131
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,280
Anything goes any extreme idea, man.

1132
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,040
You can find a home for it.

1133
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,040
Not so much.

1134
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,960
The evil specter of political correctness

1135
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,880
has made its way in the cyberspace.

1136
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,160
I should point out that the story isn't even about the movie,

1137
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,000
the stories about network solutions

1138
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,120
refusing to host the movie before anyone had ever even seen

1139
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:50,880
the movie.

1140
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:55,480
They took the guy's site, fitnothermovie.com, off-line.

1141
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,400
Because they said he violated terms of service.

1142
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,040
So that, of course, is an important thing to discuss.

1143
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,280
But it's not what is really going on, you doosh.

1144
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,200
I've been telling you about a Dutch film called Fitna.

1145
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,360
Oh, I hope it's as good as all the other Dutch films.

1146
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,640
OK, now that pisses me off.

1147
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:16,720
Soldier of orange ever heard of that one.

1148
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,920
Have you ever heard of the filmmaker, Theo Fohr?

1149
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,160
If you did, then you know about his movie,

1150
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:24,560
or a remake of his movie, the interview.

1151
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,040
I mean, that's just an ignorant asshole statement.

1152
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,280
This one, according to the filmmaker,

1153
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,920
is critical of extremist Islam.

1154
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:30,760
Filmmaker.

1155
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,920
So he doesn't even know the guy's a politician, OK?

1156
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,240
He thinks he's just a filmmaker.

1157
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:37,080
And now, as a result, is having trouble finding someone

1158
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,160
to air it or even distribute it.

1159
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,360
The director decided to put the film online.

1160
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:46,320
But now, that great US company, network solutions, the company,

1161
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:49,680
that was supposed to host the site, has suspended it.

1162
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,080
Investigating whether the site's content

1163
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:55,800
is in violation of its acceptable use policy.

1164
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,680
Great way to have it.

1165
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,800
That's fine.

1166
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,120
Brad Thor is here bestselling off the work of the Department

1167
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,160
of Homeland Security.

1168
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,320
His forthcoming vote the last pay treat.

1169
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,160
I believe he's going to get him killed.

1170
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,840
And that's why we're having him on tonight,

1171
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,520
because he's still alive.

1172
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,240
Now, you should see this Brad Thor guy.

1173
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,520
He looks like a Brad.

1174
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,040
He does, like a big Brad, Brad with a small penis.

1175
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,080
But he's a big Brad looking dude.

1176
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,880
How are you doing, Brad?

1177
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:19,760
I'll do it well, go ahead.

1178
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:20,280
Thank you.

1179
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,640
I would just like to say, in fact,

1180
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:25,360
Conway, before we start this, what is the filmmaker's name?

1181
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,840
Brad.

1182
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,800
Geared Vilders.

1183
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,920
No, fantastic.

1184
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,120
Never, ever ever listened to any other interview with his guy.

1185
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,320
Geared Vilders.

1186
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,840
Yeah, Ash Ryan.

1187
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,680
Yeah.

1188
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:41,080
Conway, I'd like to offer that guy.

1189
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,360
Geilt, what's his face?

1190
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,920
Oh, please, please, please.

1191
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,000
Geilt, what's his face?

1192
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,720
Oh, man.

1193
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,160
Glenn, fuck you.

1194
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,760
There, that film here.

1195
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:51,760
I don't even know what's in it.

1196
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,200
Do you even know what's in it, Brad?

1197
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,400
He-he-he-he-he-he.

1198
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,240
You know what?

1199
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,920
All he knows what gear to said is hit it.

1200
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:02,720
And now, there's over a hundred violent chapters in the Korean that enjoy muslims

1201
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,480
to wage horrific warfare on non-Muslims.

1202
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:11,600
And what Geird said he was going to do was absolutely not true about horrific warfare.

1203
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,520
And that's not what the movie is pointing out.

1204
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:19,520
It was taken through all those violent passages, but used modern-day documentary footage

1205
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:23,840
to show how that stuff is still being done today that this isn't just some 1400-year-old

1206
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,840
book.

1207
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,520
This is stuff that there are a lot of Muslims out there.

1208
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,600
They're not the majority of course, but there are Muslims out there that take this stuff.

1209
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,600
Seriously?

1210
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,600
How is this what they should be doing?

1211
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,600
How is anybody censoring this movie when no one knows what's been it?

1212
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,600
I can't handle it.

1213
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,600
It's too stupid.

1214
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:42,640
Glenn, back here at Dick, and you're certainly not worthy of the title of journalist.

1215
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,440
What the Internet did it?

1216
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,440
It's Friday.

1217
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:52,640
Monday Tuesday, Wednesday Thursday, full bar Friday, out of spinal front, on the weep.

1218
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,280
Oh, do I have a couple?

1219
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,280
Yeah, you betcha.

1220
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:01,760
Okay, I got to tell you that this is really opening my eyes to an immigration issue, okay?

1221
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,760
Cultures.

1222
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,760
There can be clashes.

1223
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,760
That's why we speak of a culture clash.

1224
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,520
And I think here at Wilders may be right that in certain countries, depending on the geographic

1225
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:15,600
location and on their immigration policy, and also on the social services of the country,

1226
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:21,200
such as, you know, giving you money for each child that you have, making sure that

1227
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,160
you have benefits, that you have free health care.

1228
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:27,520
All of this is what the crux of the problem is.

1229
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:32,640
It is not an Islam versus Christianity.

1230
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,080
It's not, you know, the world against Muslims, it's an immigration issue.

1231
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:43,120
Of course, you could also look at the policies of the government, where they should just

1232
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:48,720
forbid certain cultural activities as not acceptable in the country where these immigrants

1233
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,120
are coming to.

1234
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:54,600
The reason you don't see these kinds of problems this scale in the United States is

1235
01:11:54,600 --> 01:12:00,280
America and United States as an example is because that is an immigration country.

1236
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,520
It is the melting pot.

1237
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:06,360
It's made up of people from all walks of life all over the world and it's set up that

1238
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,240
way, or at least it was.

1239
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,240
That's rapidly changing, obviously.

1240
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,560
But it's all interconnected.

1241
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,960
Nothing is stand alone.

1242
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:19,000
So my final thought of the week, multicultural society, very, very difficult to implement.

1243
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,480
But it's not a religious issue.

1244
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:25,960
It is about integration of immigration.

1245
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,680
And I think that we're all smart enough to be able to figure this stuff out because without

1246
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:33,560
each other, we got no planet, we got no world.

1247
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:36,720
They need us, we need them, we all need each other.

1248
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:48,840
And let's play a song to think about that.

1249
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,920
To play us out for the maximum music for bar Friday edition of the Daily Source Code,

1250
01:12:52,920 --> 01:13:09,080
it's Leo's Saer when I need you.

1251
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:25,160
I need you, just close my eyes and I'm with you, and all that I saw will give you.

1252
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:38,760
It's only a heartbeat away, when I need love, hold out my hands and

1253
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:55,640
I touch love, I never knew that was so much love, keep in the warm night and day.

1254
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:05,440
It was a miles of empty space in between us, a telephone can't take place all your

1255
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:14,760
smart, but you know I won't be traveling forever.

1256
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:24,760
It's cold out, but hold out, and do like I do when I need you.

1257
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:36,840
But just close my eyes and I'm with you, and all that I saw will give you.

1258
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:52,200
It's only a heartbeat away, it's not easy when the road is a driver, honey that's

1259
01:14:52,200 --> 01:15:04,120
a heavy load that we wear, but you know I won't be traveling a lifetime.

1260
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:11,960
It's cold out, but hold out, and do like I do when I need you.

1261
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:51,800
When I need love, I hold out my hands and I touch love, I never knew that was so much love.

1262
01:15:53,080 --> 01:16:13,800
Keep in me warm night and day, when I need you, just close my eyes, and you would hit the side.

1263
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:30,680
I just hold out my hands and I'll share when I need you, wrapping up episode number 7-4-0

1264
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:36,360
The Daily Source Girl.

1265
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:43,000
This was tiring, but I think this is one of those shows that I actually want to listen to.

1266
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:47,720
I enjoyed it, and I want to thank everybody for contributing all week long.

1267
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:52,760
We almost had five out of five pretty close except for yesterday, just couldn't avoid it.

1268
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,520
So four out of five, ain't bad, eh?

1269
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:59,560
Hey, listen, no idea what next week is going to bring.

1270
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:05,800
I think everything's pretty cool except for maybe Tuesday, we'll see how that goes.

1271
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:10,280
Adam at podshow.com is where you can email stuff to me.

1272
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:14,040
I love hearing from you, particularly if you've got some pre-recorded stuff.

1273
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,440
There's a daily sourceco.com where you can find all of the show notes.

1274
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:22,280
Hopefully I've given you enough to live your life with passion throughout this weekend,

1275
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:26,680
until we speak again on Monday. I think you should be able to, because I'm pretty passionate

1276
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:32,040
just about the conversations that are going on. And in addition to that, yes, you still can

1277
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,280
enjoy your freedom. Have a great weekend.
