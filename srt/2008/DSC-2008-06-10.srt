1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is rake, reporting live for the TSE 7667, coming to your right from Kilford.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I don't know what's going to happen.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
People being evacuated from the scene.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I don't know what it is.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Some advice.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's big.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How is the meat?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Somebody must be living there.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't know what's happening.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm trying to get in.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Where I have.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm now entering the garden.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's a big, big house.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It looks like little catful, something is meat.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't know what's going on here.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Somebody's singing inside.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There's some kind of ritual going on here.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I've been trying to look through the window.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You look happy.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The flag.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
My god there's doing a guy behind the trunk.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll make it.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What have we to do in here?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Come on.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
A lady standing on the table.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I need something.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Trying to understand.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't know.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I got to go in.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I got to go in.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's crazy.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's $67.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped by us.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The next generation video caught anybody years.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We don't need no steam.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I like to think I'm flying into the kitchen.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm testing.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's a matter of curry.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm in one of the fall of the process.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Never need a more lines than the sand.

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No one I wanted.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I know what I don't want.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I need the angry elephant.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I need the junk.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We can guess.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Got to find a store to hold.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is some cash in on the one in place.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We're talking hate.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Talking in circles.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Trying to cut the teller because everyone is trying to chase.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We say we say we're just waiting for.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We say we say just we're just waiting for.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We say we say we say we say we're ready for something.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Some are in a dark dead corner of America.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The manufacturing estate is stream of sheep shots.

56
00:02:43,040 --> 00:03:01,000
Miss information, and I'll need other non-to-paylafays.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
me say we say we're just waiting so long.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We say we say just we're just waiting.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,520
We've been waiting, I know the promise is you made

60
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,560
We say we say the right for something

61
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,960
This can't be all that you've got

62
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,960
We're all that we've got

63
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,960
This can't be all that we've got

64
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,960
We're all that we've got

65
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,560
We're all that we've got so we're all so trolling

66
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
We got so on the car

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,440
We're all we got so on the phone

68
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,400
Stars roll and we got so on the car

69
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,600
We don't tell you

70
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,240
We say we say we're the winner

71
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,240
We say we say just we are

72
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,880
We're all we've been waiting

73
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,520
I know the promise is you made

74
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,160
We say, we say all right, but nothing new

75
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,140
Along our Jind's

76
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,480
We made you one day

77
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,760
And all my evaluated

78
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,020
You exposed to me

79
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,900
We say, we?)

80
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,180
Only we don't the same

81
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,020
L.E.A.

82
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,440
somewhat

83
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,360
We absolutely are

84
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,860
The Charlie, did he source code episode number 767

85
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,820
Hey everybody how you doing?

86
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,820
Coming to you from the

87
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,580
The affluent suburb of Surrey, known as Gilford.

88
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,580
It's Adam here.

89
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,300
Hall, my goodness.

90
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,100
This show that I'm about to rip out for you,

91
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,940
I'm gonna rip one out for you.

92
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,380
I actually prepared it yesterday.

93
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,740
Mondays have just become incredibly full with production.

94
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,140
Because stuff comes in over the weekend.

95
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,540
Of course, we did a football Friday,

96
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,060
but I really didn't check much of the voicemail Friday

97
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,940
or over the weekend.

98
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,100
It's stuff just keeps streaming in.

99
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,220
And then Mondays, like, okay, let's see what we got.

100
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,260
I gotta listen to all this stuff.

101
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,260
I don't want to miss anything in cases of great nugget in there.

102
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,980
And while there are some fantastic stuff

103
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,500
you guys have sent in, it's gonna be,

104
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,340
I don't know.

105
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,140
I'm feeling like I'm fitting into a new place in my life.

106
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,780
Does that make any sense?

107
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,620
Some people may describe it as a pathfinder role.

108
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,140
I'm not quite sure I'm trying to figure it out,

109
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,260
but all of these, what I certainly year go

110
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,900
would have considered to be political topics.

111
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,740
I'm really interested.

112
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,940
And you know, I've been home at the Curry Manor for a while.

113
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,380
And you know, so I've got some time to take a look

114
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,540
at stuff and read websites.

115
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,980
And particularly the European Union website,

116
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,660
which is available in eight million languages.

117
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,100
It looks like, but wow, man.

118
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,740
There's a lot of interesting stuff going on.

119
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,860
And it turns out it's not really political.

120
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,180
It's just life and stuff that kind of interests me.

121
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,340
I don't know if that makes sense.

122
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,220
Well, they probably doesn't everybody.

123
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,740
I had him here from Portland about this politics thing.

124
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,180
What the hell are you talking about?

125
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,340
You didn't make any sense.

126
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,740
Are you planning to run for a seat in the EU?

127
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,140
Or is it, if you want to do a political show on radio?

128
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,740
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

129
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,540
I listen to a drive.

130
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,620
Come on.

131
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,140
He's basically talking.

132
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,340
He's, are you going to work for us?

133
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,140
Oh, dude, I already do work for you.

134
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,220
Are you kidding me?

135
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,540
I totally work for you on this show, certainly.

136
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,540
Yeah, I don't know.

137
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,540
I mean, no.

138
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,540
I don't want to run for anything.

139
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,540
Absolutely not.

140
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,740
That's a shitty job, man.

141
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,740
Being a politics.

142
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,660
Remember, politics is show business for ugly people, so I can be in the real show business.

143
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,900
But it does seem like, you know, this is kind of circle of news, you know.

144
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,420
And I'm starting to discover, certainly in Europe, it's a lot easier to pin down.

145
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,220
But essentially, there's, you know, journalists just sit around and wait for either talking

146
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,580
points, which are distributed directly from a government, I guess, certainly in the states

147
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,060
from the White House, you've heard of those.

148
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,460
Either that or, you know, they'll look for news releases or press releases.

149
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,180
Like, there's a very slight nuance between a press release and a news release.

150
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:18,740
And I see lots of companies and think tanks and other organizations, some of them, non-governmental

151
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
organizations.

152
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,580
And they sometimes confuse the difference between a press release and a news release.

153
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,460
But it doesn't matter because that's what journalists will pick up.

154
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,700
And that's where the headline comes from.

155
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,500
And then I'm starting to learn how all these trial balloons work where people float stuff

156
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
up.

157
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
And I've, I've always started to make a study of it.

158
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
And it's very interesting.

159
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,500
What is unfortunately very disappointing, something that I'm noticing now with this, this

160
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,100
thing I'm doing in Holland in the morning, where I basically taking everything I'm learning

161
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,900
here on the Charlie, all of these different aspects, learning how to look at things, learning

162
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,380
how to use the audience, that would be you guys, the chuckleheads, you know, to get information,

163
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,260
trust the information, you know, build up savants status with people and have an ongoing

164
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,260
dialogue.

165
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,220
And I can almost, no matter what topic I bring up, I can almost be assured that one of

166
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,700
one of you guys is going to call in and either set me straight or give me some additional

167
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,740
information or basically contribute to what we're talking about.

168
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:17,340
What really upsets me though, what I've learned with, with trying this experiment on the

169
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,620
free-to-air broadcast radio in Holland, which of course is a microcosm.

170
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,820
And none of it does anyone any good outside of Holland because they speak Dutch, you know,

171
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:31,540
so it's not like a world global changing thing.

172
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:37,300
But what I'm noticing is that it's so easy to get answers from people in, you know,

173
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,300
offices that actually matter.

174
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,860
In fact, today, check this out.

175
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,020
Here's what happened this morning.

176
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:49,660
We got a phone call and it was a member of Parliament and he said, you know, I've been

177
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,900
asked to meet with the Hadim Karzai, who is the president of Afghanistan, who's visiting

178
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,900
the Netherlands for two days.

179
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,740
And I have to say, I'm looking at this guy, I'm like, XCIA, X-Tali-Bahn, if you can

180
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,620
believe it, at least according to reports I read.

181
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,980
He was with a Tali-Bahn before he, I guess, went over to the other side.

182
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,860
You know, United Nations, he walks around with a cape and with a hat with, you know, it's

183
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,820
not like that says uniform or anything, that's just, you know, his style, which by the

184
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:24,580
way is made of where to, I had it here, aborted lamb fetuses, now take it with a grain

185
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,780
of salt because this is a Fox News report, but it literally says, oops, hold on, just

186
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,540
reloading the page, where are you?

187
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,180
Though the hats are unmistakably dashing, the method of their production is a bit stomach

188
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,180
turning.

189
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,380
Shepherds in northern Afghanistan slaughter the mother, then remove the fetus, whose

190
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,620
downy fur is incredibly smooth because it's never been exposed to the air or sun.

191
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,180
Sometimes shepherds wait for the U to give birth before killing the lamb.

192
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,820
Each lamb is so small, its entire pelts is needed to produce one hat and many pelts are

193
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:02,780
needed to make the waist length carcuru coats, which is that cape that the guy's wearing.

194
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,980
Tell you know, that's like, that doesn't sit right with me.

195
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,860
I don't know, it just feels kind of weird about that, you know, and also the CIA thing

196
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,860
and the Tali-Bahn thing.

197
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,500
So anyway, so this, this member of parliament hears this and this of course is the point

198
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,540
that, you know, he's hearing it at a certain time when he's basically waiting to hear someone

199
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:27,620
talk about him and there's a whole, whole relationship thing there with that radio brings

200
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:34,020
to the table that is very hard to do in, you know, in our type of delivery and he says,

201
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:39,300
you know what, I'm going to offer your audience, its arrow classic rocks, so I called that

202
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,100
audience, you know, to me are the arrowheads and there's a crossover, by the way, there

203
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,300
are chuckle in the arrowheads, both in one and he says, I'm going to give your arrowheads an

204
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,220
opportunity to ask a question and I'll ask Karzai because I can ask one or two questions,

205
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,100
I want, I'd like your audience, what question do you guys want to know?

206
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,500
And I'm like, oh man, this is so fucking cool, why can't I get that shit going here on the

207
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,380
source code and I, you know, I realize that it's because they're all still in that old system

208
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,460
and, you know, it's how it works, you know, this is radio station is like ranked 9th or 10th,

209
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:18,020
you know, it's like no one cares and so even with whatever listeners there are, you know,

210
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,900
they do care and you can actually have a normal conversation with them, all the stuff that I've

211
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:28,420
learned here, I can apply there and I'm thinking, I gotta get some kind of national radio thing

212
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:39,300
going on in the US to affect the same type of change and, you know, obviously we're really

213
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,860
doing a lot together here, we're having great conversation and each in our own ways,

214
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,140
creating some small piece of individual change but it's got to move to a much broader platform

215
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:54,740
and I'm just not sure how to do it yet or, you know, what is the best way, because you don't

216
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,740
want to revert back to the old and then get stuck there, not be able to bring people forward,

217
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:05,540
to obviously, you know, like I'm doing in the, in the mornings on arrow, it's, you know, it's

218
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,100
there's a podcast version, they slice out all the music, of course, except for I think the

219
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,220
Daily Mashup and, and actually there's a lot of activity there, so, you know, that's good,

220
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,580
but there's still there's something about the live interaction and I think we probably

221
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,540
have to wait until we're a little bit further down the road with technologies like YMAX and maybe

222
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,940
we'll ultimately have cities that are just, you know, an entire cloud of connectivity and then

223
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:34,500
we can really do some real-time conversation and sometimes, you know, particularly with, with topics

224
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,940
that are very, well, very timely and topical, sometimes it just makes a difference. I'm kind of

225
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,300
stuck in that, so what am I doing with all this political stuff? I'm just trying to figure it out,

226
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,540
man, trying to figure out what the hell is going on in the world and trying to figure out how

227
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:54,500
I can affect it, if, if at all. And of course, I'm armed with Vice-Savans here today on 766.

228
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:06,980
Comic strip, Comic strip, Comic strip, Comic strip, Comic strip, Comic strip,

229
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,780
of course, I'm talking about the Lisbon Treaty, which is going up for vote in a public referendum,

230
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:16,100
the Irish should get to vote in two days from now on the 12th and I, of course, can expect

231
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,380
comic strip blogger to check in with a note about Ireland? Yeah, Adam, at least I think it's very,

232
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:29,220
so here is ESP, okay? Yeah, you correspond to Euro 2008, so can a trend-pantship script just

233
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,900
started in Austria and so on. By the way, can I just say what an awesome game that was last night,

234
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:41,140
Holland against Italy? I mean, it was like, you know, the old guys, like, cry for nascans. It was like,

235
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,420
they were back again. It was just fantastic football. Three zero against Italy, the world champion

236
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,700
is totally creamed them and I have to admit I stayed up in quite the whole game. It was absolutely

237
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:59,220
awesome. Yes, CSP. It's a run and they take place only in one single years, so it is a big

238
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:09,380
event for Europe. Europe, the same continent that started to where it was, where 91 million people

239
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:16,660
were killed. 91 million people. Okay, who needs the CIA World Bank? But when you've got CSP,

240
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:25,220
huh? Do you get it? Yeah. So nowadays, Europeans fight each other only in Kitch-Song Contests

241
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:32,420
and Sports, PC Europe nowadays is mainly due to existence of European Union. Yeah, that's a good point,

242
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:38,500
I guess, but that's what all these contests are about the European Championships, obviously. And of

243
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:44,180
course, that drastic, dreaded Eurovision Song Contests. It's better than killing 91 million

244
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:50,340
people, although some of those songs came pretty close. That's now after Eastern Notchments

245
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:59,460
needs new regulations for functions smoothly. So I kindly ask Ireland to fault yes, please one

246
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:10,420
3th. That is not the same as EU Constitution. And yes, dear Ireland, you can keep your low taxes

247
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:16,660
with this one 3 to 2. Yeah. I appreciate comics to blogger calling in with a

248
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:23,060
provoad for the referendum. The Irish will be voting on in two days time.

249
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:33,620
So let me just say, you know, yeah, of course we need laws, but you know, I did kind of

250
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,380
track this document and no, it's not an official Constitution, but it does refer to the original

251
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,500
document named the Constitution. As you know, I went in and found all kinds of different pieces

252
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,060
of legislation that were very broad, but can be adjusted nationally, particularly though,

253
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:54,820
unfortunately, when it comes to your basic human rights, which is kind of weird. I would say just

254
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,700
because of the unreadability of it, that alone should be reasoned just to say no, because you just

255
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,140
you just impossible to read. You don't actually know what it's about. I believe that what this

256
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,820
really is all about. And there's a couple of major topics like immigration policy, your European

257
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,820
wide immigration policy, that makes sense, but there's also the European army. I do believe that

258
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:21,860
if this goes into effect that a European army will be created. And of course, that's a big desire

259
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:30,180
for a lot of politicians, because a lot of the sectors they represented work with and should be

260
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:35,780
working for, but sometimes they take it a little bit too literally. You know, war is good. War is

261
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:41,060
big money. You get to make stuff. That's what the joy strike fighter is all about. You get to make

262
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,460
part of the war machines. You get to profit from it. So I'm a little concerned about that,

263
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,260
but in general, just on basis of how this has been ramrotted through every other single

264
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:56,820
parliament in the of the member states in the European Union. That's just the unreadability of it.

265
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,820
I'd say forget about it. You know, come back and show us something we actually understand and

266
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:05,300
that we can talk about. Maybe we'll decide if we have to vote on it or not. But it's not a good

267
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,740
example of you working for us. But your point is well made, uh, comics are blogger. Of course,

268
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,460
we need to figure out how to work together. Uh, but it should, I, in my opinion, it should be

269
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:21,060
something that we all can understand and not just the, uh, the political elite in Brussels.

270
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,620
You know, Adam, hey, Kurt here from Michigan now. I'm going to expand on an earlier conversation

271
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:31,060
for you. You know, uh, travel frequently through a skitball airport and answer the M on my way to

272
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:36,740
Prague. And, uh, you know, there's only a reason to schedule yourself for a long layover.

273
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,540
Let me guess what those two reasons would be for a long layover in Amsterdam.

274
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:46,820
Good ball. Uh, one being a trip downtown to, uh, and a couple matches, two of you have

275
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,620
prostate cancer prevention. Hold it. Hell yeah. On the second is two of those at the coffee shop

276
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:57,300
that's made to your trip home a lot more comfortable and enjoyable. In this curious, let's see, uh,

277
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:04,820
wasn't in pretty, as they classified me as a junior addict in the, uh, read the front door of a coffee shop.

278
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,340
And I'm trying to speed out a lot of the back doors. I mean, I have to worry about getting shot

279
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:14,340
in the back. And, uh, second, uh, curiosity would be, uh, you know, they're also going to try to take

280
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:20,180
away the, uh, the second reason for a, excuse me, downtown, uh, on a layover, uh, just curious

281
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,940
about what you thought for on that. Ew, they were for us. Yo, man. Well, let me, I'll tell you what I know

282
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,660
or at least what I've heard, so that's what I think I know. And pretty much the ladies and I guess

283
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,260
there in Amsterdam, there certainly are some men. You know, the famous red light district,

284
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:40,020
it's pretty much, uh, it's going down the tubes. Now, there's no Dutch prostitutes anymore, which

285
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,420
kind of made it, you know, what it was, it was kind of the, I don't know, now it's all Eastern block.

286
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:50,100
Um, and they're really trying to move everything into brothels and they're making, they've made

287
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,740
brothels legal. Uh, but then there's, you know, there's some problems with, they've had some problems

288
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,780
with the, um, money laundering and no kidding through, uh, through some of the sex clubs. I mean,

289
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,580
right now, there's a, you know, there's a rather conservative government in place. I would say

290
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,980
certainly from a religious standpoint. So the crack and down on it, uh, one of those, one of the

291
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:15,220
things that is often discussed in, um, in the context of the European Union, when it comes to Amsterdam,

292
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,500
is, uh, obviously about what they call these soft drugs policy, soft drugs being, uh, marijuana

293
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,580
mainly. I think that's pretty much, I think I don't think they want to say the word marijuana. It's

294
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:30,420
whether you say soft drugs, because really soft drug is only one. Um, and you know, in context

295
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,740
with the European Union, um, all, well, all you really hear from politicians is, you know,

296
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,940
it's not like all of a sudden, every country in the union has to allow soft drugs. What they're

297
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:46,420
not saying is that they're quietly, of course, closing it down entirely. Um, if you own a coffee shop

298
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:51,300
and you sell it, it can no longer be a coffee shop, you know, you can be a coffee shop now. And for

299
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,940
ever as long as you maintain it and remain solvent, if you go out of business, I think there's only

300
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:02,660
120, seven left in the entire country. Um, so it's, uh, obviously, it's going away. And there's a

301
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,580
whole nother reason for that, which is something I'm probably not going to get into today. What I've

302
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:13,140
been getting a lot of messages about this thing called, um, Codex, Alimentarius. If you haven't

303
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:20,980
heard of it, Google that Codex, Alimentarius, uh, which is Latin for the food code. And, um,

304
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,620
the food code is one of the things that's going to be used and already is being used. I would say,

305
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,340
uh, to get rid of, uh, not just, well, there's all kinds of laws against marijuana, but

306
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:36,020
this is the law that is taking away, um, our basic rights. And in the EU, it's pretty much, uh,

307
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:40,660
it's pretty much law already, although, so that's to be harmonized as they call it. Um,

308
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:46,180
and basically it says, okay, no more vitamin D, no more vitamin A, you know, we'll determine

309
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:50,660
what's good for you. We'll determine what food you can eat and how it's, uh, processed. Oh, by the way,

310
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,740
all food that you eat has to be radiated. You know, there's a lot of shit going on with that. What

311
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,820
I'm still learning about it. And it's going to be another one of my path finding missions to figure

312
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,940
that out. But the real important stuff, hookers and drugs. Yeah. I think that's all over my friend.

313
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,980
Adam White, Charles, your son, London. I'm getting kind of tired of that, Monica.

314
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,780
Well, then stop drinking. Uh, it's Charles London. Uh, I'm in Pearlwood Square. It's beautiful

315
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,260
Sunday day. Damn, it's hot. Oh, Carl, I'm three W. I'm looking at several square, which is full

316
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,100
of all the beautiful. Oh, yeah, you know how beautiful the ladies are in London when the weather is

317
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:28,020
fine outside. Uh, Sunday. There is a demonstration against George Bush coming into the UK,

318
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,340
uh, Parliament Square, one o'clock in the afternoon. On the street. Uh,

319
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,100
chocolate heads might want to know about that. Uh, you may not want to tell them.

320
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,700
All right. Of course I do. I'm just confused that this coming Sunday or is this last Sunday.

321
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,820
I didn't even know he was coming over. Uh, let's just get the info again. Did I miss it? Did I miss

322
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,060
a whole demonstration? No. No, I couldn't have missed that. Parliament Square, one o'clock

323
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,220
in the afternoon. Sunday, Parliament Square, one o'clock. All right. Let me get, let me

324
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,660
join being to that before anyone goes off and, you know, it may have already happened or not

325
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,020
happen. I don't know. I didn't even know Bush was coming over. Well, I guess it makes sense.

326
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:06,820
Isn't he honest to wear now saying goodbye to everybody? Okay. Well, so what are the details?

327
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,380
We just stand around and say Bush go home or, you know, do we have a message? Do we have a point

328
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:19,300
to make? You know, he's Dennis Kassunich, Kassinich, a Democratic representative in the United

329
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:26,420
States as yesterday, I think it was. As he said, I want to impeach Bush 35 counts of high crimes

330
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:34,580
and treason. Yeah. I got to stay on that one too. I hate it when stuff just like pops up and

331
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,940
all you got to say, I don't know him to anyone talking about. I don't think they take Kassinich

332
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,660
seriously, which is a big mistake because that guy, he's got like Napoleon complex. He's going to

333
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:47,460
fuck someone up and it just may be George Bush and good on him. All right. We'll check on that

334
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:58,740
demonstration for sure. Hello, Adam and Sandy. Hello. Well, you can cut the first bit. I was told that.

335
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,660
That's all right. Take your time, Andy. No worries. Um, hold on. I'm in Sandy and it was

336
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:10,740
extremely concerned about your story yesterday about the, uh, Lisbon KT. And seeing comments on

337
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:17,380
your, um, webpage saying, uh, from someone saying that they couldn't actually find the words

338
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:26,740
that you were talking about and decides to track it for itself. I went to the European Parliament website

339
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,220
and I'm looking at the page, the charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,

340
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:39,460
possible to write the life in their concerns in the overview that the delegations allowed

341
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:45,460
in respect to their resulting from a lawful act of war and of acts committed in time of war or

342
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:54,900
imminent threat of war were abolished on the first of July 2003. Yep. Under that is a link to a PDF

343
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:01,700
file, which is a complete text of the charter of the charter. Um, and looking for the words that you

344
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:07,300
were talking about here, I find them. There's only time perhaps as people look at one example

345
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:13,300
of just pick one around them. The detention of a minor by lawful order for the purpose of

346
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:19,780
educational supervision or his lawful detention for the purpose of bringing him before the competent

347
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:29,540
legal authority. Um, now what I take that to me is if there is already a lawful order for the

348
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:37,380
detention of a minor in existence that does not conflict with their right to liberty. And similarly,

349
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:47,300
if you go through the others and view them in that way, it's possible to interpret these as explanations

350
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:56,180
of what things will be put already exist, which will not conflict with the overriding rules

351
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:07,460
of the human rights. I hope that helps. Um, great here. I hope you win folder, uh, red pill, uh,

352
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:14,260
sits in Pinkland, etc. I love you. Uh, me, Oklahoma. All right. Hey, thanks, man. Yeah. Well, so this is

353
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,220
my point. It's like how confusing is that? We have to go back and back and forth between three

354
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:27,060
different documents and the national law applies. This supersedes that it just seems too complicated.

355
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:31,700
As I said, you know, and I'm suspicious of that. I really am. I'm just suspicious of

356
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:37,940
suspicious of complicated words. And you listen to Dennis Cassinnish in, uh, in the Senate the other

357
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:43,540
day. And you know, it's like real simple. He's saying, okay, here's what he did. Here's the law that says

358
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:50,580
where you can't do that. And it was understandable. And this is just poor. Maybe it's a language thing.

359
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,180
If there's English in English, I guess. Maybe politicians English is different, but it sure seems

360
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:58,500
like lawyer speak to me and it's just tough. Uh, Joe, hold on. Charles is back.

361
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,460
Hi, let me show you what you're doing. Listen, let me show it. Now we saw stuff. Listen.

362
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,100
This is what it's like to be an Englishman. We are doing more than we love ourselves.

363
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,460
I don't think I can say anything at all about that Charles. Other than I appreciate you call

364
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:31,060
up my friend. You're the savant, whether you're drunk or not. Here's what I haven't played

365
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:38,980
in a long time. Feed Hopkins and become. My life's in this array is so where I feel. It's just

366
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:50,100
where I wouldn't have it any other way. Life has a funny way. I think it's what they say. Yes,

367
00:26:50,100 --> 00:27:01,060
what they say. Surprise and you're reaching every day. So let me sing this song and it won't take

368
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:12,980
long. For the melody to what you're in need then we can sing this song. That's a day is long

369
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:23,860
and that's a melody that you're free. And it goes, La la la la la la la. There's a little more to learn from

370
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:36,260
every one. La la la la la la la la. No one else has the answer over there.

371
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:56,020
Oh, I can just be loved and become. Oh yeah, so many things to do is a time and nothing

372
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:05,700
never time and nothing. You need another year just to get it done. It's hard to overcome

373
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:16,340
or feel our dreams yet live our dreams. What I've been human still we must become. So let me sing this song

374
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:27,220
and it won't take long. For the melody to what you're in need then we can sing this song.

375
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:38,660
That's a day is long and that's a melody that sets your mind ahead. It goes, La la la la la la la

376
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:53,220
there's a little more to learn from every one. La la la la la la. No one else has the answer over there.

377
00:28:53,220 --> 00:29:02,660
Oh, I can just be loved and become. Oh yeah, so many things to do is a time and nothing

378
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,620
can laugh away the pain. La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

379
00:29:32,660 --> 00:30:02,660

381
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,540

Ringing from 30 miles to a full century with 10,000 feet of climate

400
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:23,780

00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:46,420
Maybe intuition or evidence as the vision

411
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,700
Any final words no

412
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,900
Yeah, so that's obviously a good one the promo could have been a bit snappy or damn

413
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:13,460
But I find that an incredibly important cause so I want to make sure I play that promo for you

414
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,460
And of course any female chuckle heads out there if you want an expert breast exam

415
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,940
I'll be happy to do that for you

416
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,620
All right big oil Jesse on the honk her big oil Jesse what's going on?

417
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:28,900
Hey, Adam is Jesse in your hands. It's a guy that tries to hybrid and works for the oil company

418
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,260
I was impressed with the quality of information you got about diesel prices and I think

419
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:40,020
I think excuse me. I mean, it is the chuckle heads of odds you've touched on on the main points

420
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:46,420
The end of the time I am taking oil and the ultra little self-reduced the regulations that went into place

421
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:51,780
Not so long ago in the world like demand for it are the key factors as one of your colleagues pointed out

422
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,260
I thought I'd bring up something else because a lot of it the heat and and

423
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:02,660
The heat comes from the public to the oil companies come that at the pump which is

424
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:10,340
April and of course, but more so than ever before the gas stations if you will they're making less money than they ever did before

425
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:16,100
I want you guys to pay very close attention to this because it really blew my mind when I heard this comment from big oil Jesse

426
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,940
Gas stations making less money than they ever had listen to them. Let me walk you through a little bit

427
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:26,740
Say they only ever try to make 10 cents a gallon the US firms here 10 cents a gallon

428
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:36,660
Most people are paying with credit card these days and say the credit card company takes two cents to that right they because they take say they take two percent of

429
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,340
Transaction in terms of dollars so say gas was a dollar

430
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:50,340
Fights making the gas stations I can 10 cents credit card fees are taking two cents well now if yes, there's four bucks

431
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,540
The gas stations still only try to make the 10 cents

432
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:59,780
But now the credit card fees are up to eight cents in that case and the gas station is only left to two cents left over

433
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,300
Those most figures on exact obviously I've been my brain hurts for a long a second

434
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,300
So you're saying if it's if it's two bucks

435
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:16,820
Then they're taking two cents the credit card companies are taking two cents and those guys are just trying to make ten cents, but isn't the ten cents?

436
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,580
Hmm

437
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,300
Yeah, I guess the margins aren't with the with the pump with the pumps I guess it hurts my brain little

438
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,260
I'm obviously taking your word for it to be go to Jesse

439
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,260
They're trying to make things work for them, but

440
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:35,860
The fact of the matter is it's not the gas stations making the money they're making less money than they ever did before

441
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,060
It's upstream it's the refiner's and the fires of the product

442
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,060
Yeah, or wherever that may be again and maybe in the middle. He

443
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,820
Thought that might be interesting. Thank you. All right big oil Jesse

444
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,460
Yeah, it's as I said it's it's complicated and

445
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,780
But you know, I'm still pretty convinced this whole thing pretty much hinges on

446
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:05,380
Speculation investments and I was just a whole lot of me grabbing for a second the financial times for today

447
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,340
Ah

448
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:15,540
Sorry about that the financial times front page fuel strike fear sparks emergency measures

449
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,500
This is over here in the UK

450
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:27,540
Strike could prompt more widespread fuel shortages than those caused by the strike at the grandchmoth oil refinery in April

451
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:33,460
I'll look at like a four-day strike by the the guys who ship the oil the tanker drivers

452
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
And they're just not gonna ship it anymore

453
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:41,540
That's pretty crazy. Let me see why why why why why why they want

454
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,380
Okay, I see why five hundred tanker drivers employed by haulage companies

455
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:52,820
Hoyer UK and suckling transport said there's a name for you hey everybody. I'm from suckling transport

456
00:37:52,980 --> 00:38:00,180
Are threatened to strike for four days from Friday. This coming Friday after the claim for a pay rise of 13% was rejected

457
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:03,700
This is all part of the problem, you know, we've we've got inflation and

458
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:08,020
People need to make more money to be able to make ends meet

459
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,660
So these companies, you know

460
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:17,060
And I believe that this you know these companies they gotta be making more money with a price of oil unless I'm nuts

461
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,060
Unless they're nuts

462
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,660
Now they gotta they gotta pay up

463
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,660
I mean there's a lot of money going around in that oil business. They should be paying their drivers

464
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:31,860
Anyway, let's see what Paul Nichols has to say always nice when podcast Paul records an MP3

465
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:37,860
Come hello Adam Paul Nichols here podcast pull that come long time listen to your show and haven't listen for some time

466
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:45,460
But start listening again. Yeah, we know all about your habits Paul as I needed to some help to paint my door and windows

467
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,340
Yeah, that's what I'm good for man now for the rest of your life whenever you smell paint

468
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,700
You're gonna be thinking of me

469
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:57,060
Programmed your brain and had a couple of these shows on my on my iPod

470
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:03,060
Just a very quick call rid of fuel think it's something I've been talking about and thinking about for a long time

471
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,940
Over here in the UK as you know we're paying 10 or more dollars a gallon

472
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:14,260
I was one of the suckers that bought a diesel car when the government announced that diesel would be cheaper

473
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,300
And of course

474
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,100
It's much more expensive now to purchase that

475
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:23,620
I've sent you a link to an article that is really interesting

476
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,180
Tars are the Indian

477
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,180
company that manufactures vehicles

478
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,220
Reckens that within the year there will be

479
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:38,900
Putting into production and air compressed vehicle and it has absolutely no emissions at all

480
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,620
Yeah, I took a look at this thing. It does look pretty cool, you know

481
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:46,260
What these guys have done is very simple. They've taken the same principle of it as a

482
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,820
With a as a combustion engine

483
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:54,180
Except instead of a spark that it makes a little explosion and then pushes the piston down in the cylinder

484
00:39:55,060 --> 00:40:00,980
There's a burst of compressed air that comes in at some amazingly high pressure and to these cars are essentially carbon fiber

485
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,300
Compressed air tanks and it's and you know they got some power

486
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:12,420
I'm not quite sure what the power to wait ratio is and you know the cars of course look completely

487
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:17,140
Dorky and you're not likely to get laid in it, but if those things came out now

488
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,140
I'd be driving one for sure

489
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:24,020
I'm absolutely certain that the government will do everything that they can to try to crush you so to keep it down

490
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,380
Yeah, so that's the thing we got to look out for you know, so what you know

491
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,340
You know the story about the electric car right Google do a

492
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,700
Google video search for that one what happened to the electric car

493
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,420
We do have to be we got to keep our eye on this and what let's watch the inventor

494
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,220
You know that Indian guy who invented this watch his back, please

495
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,700
And make sure the patents are secure

496
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,140
So we can actually get this into production because if you think about it

497
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,460
We're paying well a high rate tax owners anyway we're paying 40%

498
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,260
at the moment and

499
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,020
That's that hits the wallet hard

500
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,060
We're paying 17 and a half percent VAT and then of course

501
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:06,260
We're paying nearly 70% on our gas as well and it doesn't surprise you to know that hardly any of that goes back into the

502
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,580
Go back into the government coffers that are to finance

503
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,020
Public transport or anything other with them now where does it go and I'm ready to be surprised

504
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,100
Oh, it's only a very small Mac does that and the AA go on about a lot

505
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:27,700
Anyway, um, it will be very interesting to see if this air compressed vehicle does make it to the streets because I tell you what

506
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,780
I'd be the first in line to buy one

507
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,100
No, no, no, no, man, you'd be number two because I'd be a front first on paying 70 to 20 penned

508
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,460
a week at the moment for a petrol just to get back and

509
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,780
Forward to work in my wife has a car as well, and it's just becoming

510
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,580
economically unviable

511
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,700
Very mindful of the three-minute thing. Don't worry. I'm gonna keep it very very short, but

512
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,820
The government recently the archives

513
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,260
Showed us that the government's not public

514
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,900
Publication excuse me of the fact that

515
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:05,860
Tobacco had a link with cancer because it would hurt the tax revenue and

516
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,860
Is that really true?

517
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:13,140
They stopped publicizing that because they didn't want to hurt tax revenue. I have a hard time believing that, man

518
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,780
Let me see let's see what my pack says here

519
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,580
stopping smoking reduces the

520
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,260
risk of fatal heart and lung diseases smoking kills

521
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:27,220
UK duty paid that's just absolutely shocking now if

522
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:33,300
As true to their word as they are and they want to help the economy they're gonna do everything like can

523
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,220
To reduce the tax

524
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,220
pound

525
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,460
To help the economy and of course to help emissions by this air compressed vehicle

526
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,820
Let's wait and see my guess is we'll be waiting a long time

527
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:51,300
All the best mate. See you. All right, mate. Thanks. Let's stay on top of that because that Tata thing is pretty amazing

528
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,700
Just Google the Tata motor company

529
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,020
And there's a couple of Google videos about it too. And you know as I said it's like, you know

530
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:03,140
It's not the sexiest thing but you fill it up in three minutes with compressed air and if you don't have

531
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:07,300
a compressed air nozzle anywhere near which by the way I think every service station in the world has

532
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,580
compressed air. I don't know if it's at the right kind of compressed air but they certainly have

533
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:15,140
compressed air to fill up your tires with I don't know if it's enough power or pressure to

534
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,340
to use

535
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,580
but otherwise you know this thing has a little

536
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,980
built-in compressor on board and

537
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:29,620
I think you plug it in and then it runs for four hours and your tank is then completely filled up total cost

538
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,580
two dollars

539
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,260
All right, a little more so I'm before we bring in a timing rod

540
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,580
You just don't hear shit like this on the radio

541
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,580
and that is the big benefit

542
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,580
Trinity Lake girls so like fast cars too

543
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:05,540
and a tiny red carpet but it was for my brother not for me

544
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:12,180
Later on that afternoon I hid it in my room

545
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,940
Dad was mad, but mama can't do a call

546
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,820
He said girls like fast cars too

547
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,380
Speed ain't just for boys

548
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,700
It's something about the sale

549
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,340
I've done a week in yours

550
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,140
and we love to look and feel

551
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,700
I've bought it from it's steel

552
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,860
but my soul is what makes the ladies move

553
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:44,180
Yeah girls like fast cars too

554
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:51,700
When I got my first real hard I thought I was dealer hard

555
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:55,140
Daytona rain up and down the street

556
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,780
Sifter mounted on the floor pretended

557
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:05,380
Three was on the door one turned off the key and I was free

558
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:10,100
On those long hot summer nights

559
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:15,780
I pinched out that light and with a wing I'd be a lot of sight

560
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,100
Stake girls like fast cars too

561
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,820
Speed ain't just for boys

562
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,220
It's something about the sale

563
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,020
I've done a week in yours

564
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,420
and we love to look and feel

565
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,220
I've bought it from it's steel

566
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:37,220
But my soul is what makes the ladies move

567
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:42,500
Yeah girls like fast cars too

568
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:56,660
So, Mr. Let's see if here's what else you got right here

569
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:00,660
You can skip the fancy SUVs

570
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,500
I'm looking forward

571
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,380
I'm branding to the door

572
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:12,180
Many apple and high stream machines

573
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,980
That girls like fast cars too

574
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,540
Speed ain't just for boys

575
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,700
It's something about the sale

576
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,580
I've done a week in yours

577
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,620
And we love to look and feel

578
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,020
I've hauled it from it's steel

579
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:33,060
But my soul is what makes the ladies move

580
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:36,260
Yeah girls like fast cars

581
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,580
The most fast cars

582
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:41,060
Girls like fast cars

583
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,540
Don't get much more market than get my friends

584
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,420
Girls like fast cars too

585
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,820
But you will not like my tata

586
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,620
In fact, you'll stay away from my tata

587
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,420
I'm gonna get laid in the tata

588
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,580
But you'll save the planet or something like that

589
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,300
Oh boy, okay

590
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,820
I'm gonna wind it up for today

591
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,660
As promised here's a atomic rod

592
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,980
It had all kinds of questions about atomic waste

593
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,100
I think the dog is trying to give me a message

594
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,180
Have a listen to the latest from atomic rod

595
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,260
Adam atomic rod, I'm here

596
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,580
Atomic Insights.blocksbut.com

597
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,340
Herjue question about the Russian mineral

598
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,780
That seems to be able to remove radioactive isotopes from water

599
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,300
I'm not an expert in that area

600
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,580
So I'm having a few of my own Uber so I want to look into the matter for me

601
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,540
Now for a rant

602
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,940
If you're interested in a venue, you can adjust one more demonstration

603
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,380
Of the successful conditioning

604
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,100
That you and most of the rest are thinking of has received from people

605
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,500
That simply do not like nuclear power

606
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,060
And about how much you have learned about how nuclear is cleaned

607
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,700
I can drive down energy press by replacing coal and oil

608
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,700
And how much our nuclear analysis improve

609
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,140
You all come to a point in the description where you ask that is all good

610
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,660
But what do you do about the waste?

611
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,660
All right, all right, I rod

612
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,020
Dude next time

613
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,460
If you're writing this down just slow down a bit slow down

614
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,660
Yeah, and you got time to get it

615
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,260
I know you're trying to get it within three minutes

616
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,260
But just slow down because it's important stuff

617
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,500
And now everyone's focused so pay attention

618
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,420
The condition has gone off for decades

619
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,980
Compared to all of the source of human and true power

620
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,780
Nuclear efficient producers remarkably tiny amounts of waste

621
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:13,460
You could put all the useful that we have ever produced into a single football stadium

622
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,660
And still have plenty of room left to spare in the entire US

623
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,180
Wait a minute, is that really true?

624
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,220
Is that all that it is in a football stadium?

625
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,460
That doesn't seem right

626
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,020
All that we've all that we've produced all nuclear waste into one football stadium

627
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,420
I mean, that's not a lot of that's true

628
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:34,500
We have only three operating variables for the rest of the somewhat contaminated metal concrete

629
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,900
Protective clothing and other assorted debris from plant operation construction deconstruction

630
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:42,260
Those places are tightly controlled and exceedingly well organized

631
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,060
The total lamass devoted to properly storing radioactive materials

632
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,940
Let's go from nuclear power plant operation is incredibly small

633
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,300
Perhaps a few hundred acres

634
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:55,060
The best news is a large portion of what's currently considered be radioactive waste can and should be recycled

635
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,380
Into either new plants or new fuel bundles

636
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,220
Now take a hard look at the competition

637
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,980
The world smokes decks and tailpipes

638
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:05,140
If you millions of tons of deadly waste products add into our shared atmosphere every single day

639
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,220
All right, I wish you were to done this slower, man

640
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,860
I really do because your point is so well made

641
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,900
You know

642
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,100
How come there's no well?

643
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,140
We know why there's no information if all you're saying is true, Rod

644
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,540
That's

645
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,540
That's how we're talking about one football stadium

646
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,540
Yeah, that's a big difference with the smoke stacks

647
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,340
I'll shut up now let you focus on what he's saying

648
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:32,660
Well, they we cannot recover any of those materials and use them for anything else because they are now pollution that we must all breathe

649
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,220
If you do not think of them as deadly waste products

650
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:40,180
It is because you have been conditioned to accept them as a fact of life in a world where people want to fly planes

651
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:44,420
Drive cars power up the stink boats and watch their big screens in a climate control room

652
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,740
If you did not believe they are deadly waste products

653
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:53,780
I suggest you consider what will happen if you or anyone else decide she's so not tell pipe or take a couple of deep breaths in a smoke field room

654
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,100
You would never consider such an experiment a new

655
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:02,580
Neither would most other people you can however find plenty of stories about how the experiment turns out every time it's tried

656
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,500
With combustion deadly waste products humans avoid areas were the concentrations high up to kill them

657
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,660
We also tried to minimize long-term effects

658
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,980
But some of this live in areas where the pollution's bad enough to crush shorter less healthy lives

659
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:21,700
At some of your tiny chucklets or maybe even some of your older Londoner friends about the deadly small cuts by burning fossil fuel

660
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:26,020
Do it even I remember what Los Angeles used to be like 15 years ago 20 years ago

661
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:32,660
And they certainly clean that up the smong has gotten a lot better. You should be just as cloud hanging over LA

662
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:38,180
So yeah for sure feels new clear vision waste is a good news story because the volume of small

663
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:43,060
We can isolate materials in containers and put them in type the controlled spaces that most was never had to see

664
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:50,020
All you have to do is accept the fact that most people are able to follow simple safety rules like stay away from the area and do not eat the leftovers

665
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:57,700
You and your audience can help us all break through the conditioning that is make people believe that fossil fuel wages

666
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,500
Okay, but fission way to something we will never figure out

667
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,700
routine fossil fuel waste kills people every day

668
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:07,540
Retain nuclear fission waste from power plant operations has never killed anyone

669
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:12,900
Take a couple of red pills look around the world today and guess who just might be interested in making sure the

670
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:19,380
Conditioning remains intact great hair. Hope you went passionate potato feed him and declare your independence from big fossil

671
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:24,180
Remember in a democracy they are us now. This is true

672
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:29,860
You work for me and I work for you. I guess in some twisted way atomic rod everybody

673
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:36,180
That's pretty amazing. I got to get more data on the the volume of waste that doesn't seem like a hell of a lot

674
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:41,940
Yeah, you know honestly you got a lot more chance of dying by getting hit by a car and traffic

675
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:46,580
And this is of course the problem is we have been conditioned but in a more overall sense

676
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,860
We've been conditioned that we want it we're supposed to be safe 24 hours a day

677
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,740
You know doctor fucks up supposed to be safe from that

678
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,260
You know that's supposed to happen. This is there's rules regulations

679
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,340
Demit how can we not be safe?

680
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,620
You know fact is we're not safe folks. That's just the bottom line

681
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,740
We're just not safe get over it get used to it

682
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:09,540
Hey, one other thing. I want to start a topic. So we've got to codex elementarious

683
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,460
How about the something goes along with that fluoride in the water?

684
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:17,460
I know this is a hot topic because I've been doing a little bit of research and

685
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:23,860
You know I've been brought up thinking fluoride is in the water to make a teeth healthy

686
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:29,060
And of course I read the contrarian view saying no, no, no, it makes the population complacent

687
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:35,060
Which apart which is all of course of that whole conditioning of your supposed to be safe and don't worry

688
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:39,220
You'll be safe just let the government take care of you you'll be safe which is bullshit

689
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,100
Until I read the legacy of ashes

690
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:49,780
Which is the book that Uncle Don is mentioned in and in one passage I can't really remember it off the top of my head

691
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:56,820
But there was some like they were doing all kinds of covert activities and had to go get some cocaine from some camp and

692
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,060
Essentially what they did is they they put fluoride in the water

693
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:07,620
Of this camp that they were going to go and and grab this coke from and these missiles or weapons or whatever

694
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:13,780
You know it's one of those convoluted CIA stories another nice piece of American history and it actually said, you know

695
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:19,060
Oh, we had overflow over fluoridated the water and it gave most of the people in the camp

696
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:29,300
Diaria and other stomach ills ale ailments and I think in wait a minute if the CIA is using that shit

697
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:36,100
And you know it really literally spells it out. They you know they use it to you know as a way to

698
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:42,900
Get into the camp and get what they wanted and you know it seems to me like that's something funky going on there

699
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,860
And this fluoridation of our water. I'm a little bit concerned about it

700
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,620
So let's open up that topic

701
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:53,060
Keep it along keep it run alongside the red pill that atomic rod keeps shoveling into our mouths and

702
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:57,860
Let's see if we can meet up again that tomorrow because I'm going to the city Thursday

703
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,860
Thursday and we'll certainly do a food bar Friday

704
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,980
I am definitely looking forward to it before I go the one last comment

705
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:10,420
Note that everything has happened so far in the week where the hell is Roger Smalls?

706
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:14,500
See this is the question that's on everybody's mind forget nuclear waste

707
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,300
Forget anything else. Where the hell was Roger Smalls? I can't find it anywhere

708
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,860
I eat really I am actually getting to I am sorry to get it a little bit worried

709
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,340
Not personal is blog. It's not I'm stalking right I can't find what just more than you

710
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:32,580
Where we even know if you saw a ride for you know you haven't checked in for God knows how long

711
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,020
I mean the you know the inside noise is the email and you're keeping content

712
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,060
No, please let us know could Roger please phone in

713
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:42,580
You know when it here so we want to get some bot just falls love we haven't heard of them for

714
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:49,540
God knows how long anyway that that was just a side note that I had to run with poppins my mind anyway

715
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,100
I shall speak you later

716
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,060
I'm

717
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:56,580
Not saying what knives enough to the question. They were for us

718
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:02,740
Yeah, you know it's a bit upsetting to me as well and I I do know a couple of people that had a

719
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:07,540
Recent Skype chat with him and apparently he was in jail when he just got out and you know

720
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:11,620
I desperately want to help the guy out, but you know if he doesn't contact me there's nothing I can do

721
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:17,140
So another public call out to Roger Smalls Roger just Skype me or send me an email or

722
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:23,220
Preferably call in just let us know you're okay, man. That's all I really want to know and if there's anything I can do for you

723
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:27,460
You're one of the earliest savants one of the earliest and most

724
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:31,540
Trustworthy and reliable chuckle heads always there and I

725
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,540
Just kind of vanished off the face of the earth. So we're missing you

726
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:41,300
Anyway everybody I'll talk to you again on Thursday until that time live your life with passion please and as long as it lasts

727
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,860
Enjoy your free another fine

728
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:46,580
Media old presentation stick it in your ear

729
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,100
You
