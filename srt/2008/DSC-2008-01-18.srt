1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
More listening to a man who had his nail clipper confiscated outside a plane, only to have

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
a flight attendant inside a plane and a book and a knife, Adam Curry.

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,480
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,120
content in my ears, I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Just like it's namesake, this Charlie's here for your convenience.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Here's the Daily Source code, 7-11.

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll fly, I'll fall in charge now, I know it makes me better.

8
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I have something called a sky.

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, I want to tell you, I want to walk for you.

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, I'll come and make it mine.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Time now, my life's too hot, give it all the time, but I know it makes me better.

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't show you why, I've got a touch of sky.

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I know it makes me better.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I have something called a sky.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, I want to tell you, I like to walk for you.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh, I'll come and make it mine.

19
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

20
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, I want to tell you, I like to walk for you.

22
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

23
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

24
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

25
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

26
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

27
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

28
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

30
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

33
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

34
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

35
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

36
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, I'll take the myth and make it mine.

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, I want to draw a book for Patreon.

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Thank your audience.

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah.

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hi.

45
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Go ahead.

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,880
You know, if I find it on the PMN, you got to download it.

47
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,560
You got to think about the order.

48
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,280
And then, of course, it's the voicemail message.

49
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,760
I think I had three, four, let me just count.

50
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,000
Probably about 150 or so to go through.

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,600
Anyhow, if each one can be a maximum of three minutes,

52
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,400
you can understand how that also is quite time consuming.

53
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,680
But I really don't want to miss anything.

54
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,200
So that's why I meticulously go through all of them.

55
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,120
Get everything set up, ready to roll.

56
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,240
And little side track there.

57
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,960
So I was looking at new mixers, young polette.

58
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,520
And after I saw his hit test video,

59
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,080
I'm getting wood for his set up there.

60
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,520
So what's a boy who has everything?

61
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,000
What's he going to go and buy?

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,200
Of course, a new mixer.

63
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,240
So in the market for that and found a fantastic one, by the way,

64
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,640
the law was Z4, Lima, Alpha, Whiskey, Oscar, Z4, Zulu,

65
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,480
four and check it out.

66
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,640
Man, I'm really liking that.

67
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,040
Not as a portable job, but just something

68
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,800
would give me a little more functionality

69
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,480
than the Yamaha that I'm using with Casplaster.

70
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,600
So then, of course, speaking of Casplaster,

71
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,400
I had so much stuff, so many different elements

72
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,560
that I knew I was going to fill up all the bays

73
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,960
as a word, the virtual bays we can fill up with tracks.

74
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,680
I've run into this before I think I recall

75
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,240
that when you really fill it up, then there's

76
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,600
some irreproducible bug that I just can't figure out.

77
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,680
That all of a sudden you get access violations.

78
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,240
And then it says, unable to open temp.mp3.

79
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,400
And then you basically have a choice,

80
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,800
and I always go the hard route.

81
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,240
Of course, you basically remove the Casplaster at I&I file

82
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,600
from its folder, rename it to something else.

83
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,320
Open that in a separate notebook window,

84
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,400
then start Casplaster again, so it's a new I&I file.

85
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,840
Then start copying, pasting stuff in until you hit a bug.

86
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,200
And that, of course, is the piece that doesn't seem

87
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,040
to be related to a specific file name

88
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,320
or a file, but just the number of files,

89
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,520
and then it starts to freak out.

90
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,760
So I got a couple of quick time windows open,

91
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,680
leaving three Casplaster windows free.

92
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,360
And so I'm going to kind of move it along.

93
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,120
A couple of comments from you guys in between

94
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,840
some awesome music, most of which today's Podsafe,

95
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,960
but how can I say, certainly not all?

96
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,480
Hey Adam, it's a glorified mic here.

97
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,080
How'd you listen to your show for a few months now?

98
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,880
I heard about you on the Ron Paul's forums,

99
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,080
and I've been listening to you ever since.

100
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,920
It's part of me for getting a little defensive

101
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,800
for a fellow Ron Paul supporter,

102
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,280
but this is about that douchebag, Chris Moelle.

103
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,040
Now I know your British fans are wondering,

104
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,680
where an American gets off-trashing a British shock

105
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,760
job after only hearing a few minutes of a show

106
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,200
on the DSC, and I'll tell you.

107
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,120
A golden rule of radio is, if you have to talk over

108
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,200
a music bed, you fucking suck.

109
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,000
It's proof that what the DJ is saying

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,560
isn't interesting enough to the listeners.

111
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
That's right.

112
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,680
You have to punch up as it dulling ramblings

113
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,040
with music that's just popular enough

114
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,120
not to turn off the radio.

115
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,720
Oh, and by the way, if your sidekick's name is

116
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,920
preceded by the word comedy, even on funny hack.

117
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,560
And Adam, I love you, but I'm not in love with you.

118
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,600
Oh, man, I love you too, de Homo.

119
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,320
That's absolutely, well, that's funny.

120
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,640
And it is interesting that that did catch my ear as well

121
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,000
when I played that Chris Moelle's bit,

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,480
that he had this background music,

123
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,120
you know, like real kind of almost like a techno

124
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,240
kind of driving beat.

125
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,800
I tend to agree, I've never been a big music bed guy.

126
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,200
I really like just the, well, actually,

127
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,680
what the hell am I talking about?

128
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,720
Let's do a little bit of our own background track

129
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,360
on the Charlie for this footballer.

130
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,320
Of course, something that fits in with the,

131
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,720
with the mellowness of the show.

132
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,120
We always, when we think of Glenn Miller,

133
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,800
we always think of the Moonlight Serenade,

134
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,120
but this is the sunrise Serenade.

135
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,600
By the way, I did hear back from Moelle's producer,

136
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,440
Rachel Jones, she, I guess she's like the,

137
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,200
she's like a BBC overall morning producer, something,

138
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,880
and then she turned me on to Alan Hayden.

139
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,480
I guess he is one of the producer boys who runs around there.

140
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,960
And he was really nice, actually, you know,

141
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,520
and he said that Chris was a big fan of the,

142
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,320
of the Daily Source code,

143
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,880
and you know, they were really working on their,

144
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,280
on their downloads as well,

145
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,680
and really serious about their podcast.

146
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,440
And it's, it's interesting,

147
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,400
we get 270,000 downloads per episode.

148
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,920
I'm like, damn, that's pretty good.

149
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,280
I said if you guys wanted any promotion from Potcho,

150
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,120
I'm bringing it over boys,

151
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,840
we're growing with 30,000 percent annually.

152
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,840
So what do you think?

153
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,800
Is this working this Glenn Miller stuff?

154
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,360
Let's try it under another comment here.

155
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,440
Hey, Adam, this is Rick and Ohio.

156
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,800
Oh, high of the airway, that was excellent, man.

157
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,520
Like when I heard that come on,

158
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,320
you just talk about a lot of memories coming back into my head.

159
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,920
And think good if you didn't talk over that one,

160
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,640
because well, they would've kind of ruined it,

161
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,000
but thanks a lot for bringing those memories.

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,520
And I suppose next one you'll be playing

163
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,080
as a one-ton soldier, something like that.

164
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,280
Rock on, buddy.

165
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,160
Come here, man.

166
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,840
Thanks, buddy.

167
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,560
Yeah, it's the soundtrack to your lives, man.

168
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,120
I got a lot of people sending me emails

169
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,760
about pilot of the airways when I played that.

170
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,720
Some people even sent me better recordings

171
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,000
and lots of stories just like that.

172
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,400
You know, I was in the car with my kid.

173
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,280
You know, you can place yourself immediately

174
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,120
when you hear that song.

175
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,040
It's just one of those.

176
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,800
And I believe in the category, a one-hit wonder.

177
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,120
Oh, yeah, I know what it's going to say.

178
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,880
Related to pilot, and this will be the only kind of like semi-rant

179
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,760
that I'm going to do today,

180
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,000
because I do want to get back to the music.

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
As we listen continuously to the sounds

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,280
of the Glenn Miller band, sunrise, serene.

183
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,520
Just good enough to keep you listening.

184
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,160
This crash landing of the British airways flight from Beijing.

185
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,760
I think it's BA38.

186
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,680
I've, you know, there's quite a nice discussion going

187
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,560
on over curry.com about this because when I heard of this,

188
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,240
I was like, wow, you know, this is really interesting.

189
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,920
And as a particular to airman like myself, you know,

190
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,560
we want to know what happened.

191
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,200
And, you know, because this is a situation,

192
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,400
and of course, the right now, the preliminary reports,

193
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,320
and I've been keeping my eye on here on this.

194
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,000
It's pretty much top of the news in the UK.

195
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,440
The preliminary reports state that the aircraft lost full power.

196
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,960
So not just both engines, but also all electrical power.

197
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,160
And I've heard conflicting reports

198
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,640
anywhere between 1,400 feet on final approach.

199
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,840
Now, this is something we actually trained for.

200
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,160
You know, well, not necessarily for a full electrical failure,

201
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,480
but we certainly trained for coming up short

202
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,880
because of an engine failure.

203
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,800
And that was pretty consistent I thought with what I saw.

204
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,720
But, you know, what we're getting news wise,

205
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,840
just really bugs the crap out of me because, well, you know,

206
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,120
they have no experts.

207
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,120
I have not, I've yet to see the BBC put an actual pilot

208
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,200
on television.

209
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,600
There was a pilot who called up on the radio two today.

210
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,840
And he said, look, you know, this is kind of interesting

211
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,560
because, you know, to have this double engine failure

212
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,080
on the triple seven, which only has two engines.

213
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,200
These massive Rolls Royes engines.

214
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,160
If that really happened, it's first it's the first time

215
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,400
and I believe the aircraft's history.

216
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,040
But, you know, add to that a full electrical failure,

217
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,280
I would say we'd have to ground the entire fleet.

218
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,320
That's the news.

219
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,760
That's what we should be talking about.

220
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,960
People should not be flying on triple seven

221
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,880
until we understand what happened.

222
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,840
That's a real safety issue.

223
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,600
Instead, all we're hearing from British Airways

224
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,120
is, look how great the flight crew was.

225
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,440
Now, you know, obviously any landing that you walk away

226
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,440
from good landing, any landing that the plane is reusable.

227
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,840
That's a great landing.

228
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,720
So, you know, of course, Kudos to the flight crew

229
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,080
for whatever happened, whether it was pilot error

230
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,840
or there really are only a couple of things

231
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,720
that this could have been, top of the list maintenance.

232
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,840
So, maybe there was something poorly maintained.

233
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,200
We'll find out eventually in the long, long run.

234
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,640
If they can't find anything else, it has to be maintenance.

235
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Because, you know, that's just how it works.

236
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,840
You maintain the stuff and it won't break.

237
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,080
Unless there was faulty parts,

238
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,040
but we'll find that out as well.

239
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,360
But still, double engine failure, full electrical failure, man.

240
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,800
That's really tough to explain away to maybe one part

241
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,840
not working or being, or malfunctioning.

242
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
The second one.

243
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,800
Hold on a second, let me just take a look here.

244
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,440
Because I did kind of write this up,

245
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,520
and maybe I should fall along with my own notes.

246
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,360
Oh, crap.

247
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,200
What is this?

248
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,240
Now, I don't have connection to the net.

249
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,840
Oh, I hate it when that happens.

250
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,240
I've had a lot of connectivity problems.

251
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,320
Anyway, it could easily have been fuel starvation,

252
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,560
which means they ran out of fuel.

253
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,000
Now, this is certainly something

254
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,040
the air crew would have been aware of before 1000 feet.

255
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,640
So, they would have, I think,

256
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,200
legally have had to call it in if they were to run and low.

257
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,320
It's possible there was a malfunction there.

258
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,640
It's probably that there's, look, they got fuel in Beijing

259
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,480
presumably, so it's possible they got short change.

260
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,960
But still, the crew would have known about it.

261
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,240
Whether is another option, I'm always aware of the weather.

262
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,320
There was as far as I know, no wind shear conditions,

263
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,440
which could definitely have made this happen,

264
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,600
although that usually happens, I would say,

265
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,960
when you're a little bit closer to the runway.

266
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,120
And then there's all kinds of conflicting reports

267
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,280
about people saying, oh, I heard it roar overhead,

268
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,080
you know, well, the plane will make noise without its engines,

269
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,560
but it's not really going to roar.

270
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,720
And it could also be the pilot's just fucked up.

271
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,320
I mean, honestly, that's, it's just completely possible.

272
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,880
Maybe he misjudged the, the glide path.

273
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,640
You know, it looked to me like a hard landing.

274
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,320
And, you know, when you hear people speak of the plane belly flopping,

275
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,000
you know, I've done that and I wrecked some instruments

276
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,840
even doing it.

277
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,760
It was early in my flying career and what happens is,

278
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,800
you're too, they actually too high above the runway at one point.

279
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,360
And then you flare and then you run out of air speed.

280
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,040
And then it's just going to drop out of the sky now,

281
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,480
it doesn't matter whether you're at a thousand feet

282
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,240
or whether you're at a ten feet or five feet from the ground.

283
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,720
If you run out of air speed, you're going to drop down.

284
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,400
So it could also have just been a pure air speed issue.

285
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,280
I mean, all kinds of things we don't know about,

286
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,560
but I'm a little sick of all of this,

287
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,680
the crew were heroes.

288
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,520
We don't know that.

289
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,320
We don't know if they were or weren't.

290
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,720
Again, my thesis is that if they got everyone on the ground,

291
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,160
and they walked right away from the plane, they did their job.

292
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,120
Or if it was mechanical failure.

293
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,840
And until we know that, we should be very suspicious of this aircraft.

294
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,640
Because obviously, I'm going to give the benefit of doubt

295
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,640
to the, to the air crew.

296
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,640
Statistically, I'd have to say, top of the list pilot error

297
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,600
and then it's maintenance.

298
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,200
Okay, so much for that ramp.

299
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Just need to get that out there, you know.

300
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,360
And it makes you wonder, this stuff I know about,

301
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,560
and I see the reporting being shitty.

302
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,440
How about the stuff I know nothing about?

303
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,640
Is that just a shit?

304
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,720
You might think so.

305
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,000
From our planet, I can't erase all my imagination.

306
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,120
What I wasted all night.

307
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,120
Oh, and I tried to believe in the simplification.

308
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,400
To be there when I arrived at my destination.

309
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:49,120
Feel like I was wasting the time in more time when we'd stay home.

310
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,560
I'm old, what if I never loved you?

311
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,680
I tried, but I could never be the one to say when we'd stay home.

312
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,440
Oh, I'm old, I could never leave that way.

313
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,040
You could see my light in the slogan, I think.

314
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,320
We were so unfaithful.

315
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,160
Oh, do you make me feel like a nearing hyperventilation?

316
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,360
When you call me liar?

317
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,720
Or is it my imagination?

318
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,720
Feel like I was wasting the time when we'd stay home.

319
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,080
I'm old, what if I never loved you?

320
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,440
I tried, but I could never be the one to say when we'd stay home.

321
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,680
Oh, I'm old, I could never leave that way.

322
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:06,640
But I could never have been that one to say when we'd stay home.

323
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
Oh, no.

324
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,120
If I said, I'd be the one to say when we'd stay home.

325
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,720
I could never have been the one to say when we'd stay home.

326
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,240
I could never be the one to say when we'd stay home.

327
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:51,240
I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I can't forget the more I know I know I can't forget the more I know I know I can't forget the more I know I know I can't forget the more I know I know I can't forget the more I know I know I can't forget the more I know I know I know I

328
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,580
But if I never never gonna evera else, never gonna ever

329
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,240
If from my Alberta i can't have a band- named is

330
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
once just as hyper-fenolation

331
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:07,240
Reading straight from the biopage and the pot-seventi music network once just has Blade hundreds of shows all over North America

332
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:18,240
They signed to JFK media early 2006 and released the first album destination with the lay Bloc Tortop Heat he first 2006 won's just is a blend of rock and reggae with hockey Popp melodies

333
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,740
Brought to you by, I guess, J.S.K. Meadie.

334
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,240
Oh my goodness.

335
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
Yeah, cool song though.

336
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
I liked a lot of those guys.

337
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,240
I've liked a page of stuff up on the podcast music now.

338
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,240
We're starting in October 2007.

339
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,240
Oh, yes.

340
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Oh, do I need some work on my ass?

341
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Amy Mack.

342
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
How are you doing, darling?

343
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,240
It's time for my answer, sir.

344
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,240
Hey, Adam.

345
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
It's Amy Mack.

346
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
Yeah, huh?

347
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
I got you.

348
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,240
I'm so glad to hear that you're feeling better.

349
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
I didn't want to make you work out when you were down and out.

350
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Aw, thanks, baby.

351
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
I appreciate it.

352
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
Now, today we're going to be doing a standing exercise.

353
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
Okay.

354
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,240
You're self situated and we'll get started.

355
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
We're going to do a standing, baby.

356
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
Okay.

357
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
I like that.

358
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
I'm ready.

359
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
Start with your feet shoulder with a part.

360
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
Okay.

361
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,240
Now, kick your right leg out to the front and then bring it back to center.

362
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
Okay.

363
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Then take your left leg and take it all the way behind you so that you're in a deep lunge.

364
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
Okay.

365
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
You're going to put your left hand on the floor.

366
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
Oh, shit.

367
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,240
Now, bring the left leg back to the center and stand up tall.

368
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Okay.

369
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
Nice.

370
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Now repeat.

371
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
Three more times.

372
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Okay.

373
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,240
So right leg out.

374
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Right.

375
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Back to center.

376
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
Out center.

377
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,240
And then left leg back and then hand on the floor and back to center.

378
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Okay.

379
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,240
Two more.

380
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,240
Out.

381
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
Right.

382
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,240
Center.

383
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,240
Back.

384
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,240
And left.

385
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
Yep.

386
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
And center.

387
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
One more.

388
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
Okay.

389
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Right.

390
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,240
And center.

391
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
And left.

392
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
And center.

393
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Four.

394
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Great.

395
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,240
Now switch sides.

396
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
Left leg front.

397
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
Left leg.

398
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,240
And back to center.

399
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
Okay.

400
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,240
And back to center.

401
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
And then right leg back into a lunge.

402
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
Right hand touches the ground.

403
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,240
It's just tiring.

404
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
Great.

405
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
Keep it up.

406
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Three more to go.

407
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Okay.

408
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
Kick.

409
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,240
And lunge.

410
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
Yes.

411
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Three.

412
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
Kick.

413
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
And lunge.

414
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,240
Last one.

415
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
Okay.

416
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,240
Kick.

417
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
And lunge.

418
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
I'm back.

419
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Excellent job.

420
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
Great.

421
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
Well, it's a pleasure being done.

422
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Good job, everybody.

423
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Good job.

424
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
All you do is see listeners.

425
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
And until next time.

426
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
Exercise.

427
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Yeah, baby.

428
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,240
Thank you so much, Amy Mac.

429
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,240
I love it when women are mean to me.

430
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Let me tell you something about these motherfuckers out here.

431
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,240
When I scream at me, and curse at me.

432
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
Let me tell you something.

433
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
My brain has been washed.

434
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,240
And it's hollow with spell.

435
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
That wasn't too much.

436
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
She's just insisting.

437
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,240
Some's baby.

438
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,240
Jammed in the space of the hell.

439
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
Let me tell you something.

440
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
Like a cheese free.

441
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,240
I'm just better than you.

442
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,240
And I'm not buying you two.

443
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
So fix your arm.

444
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Well, now that's something to do.

445
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,240
I chase my mouth to crack.

446
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,240
The loudest blow on my day.

447
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:26,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

448
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

449
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,240
You're a man, tell you something.

450
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,240
My mind's been washed.

451
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,240
And I'm copying a smoke.

452
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
They're working too much.

453
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
Make sure to never pay off our estimates.

454
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
To be our actors' plug.

455
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,240
Yeah, I tell you something.

456
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
Like a registered bar.

457
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
Die of your mind!

458
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
I keep on holding up.

459
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,240
Easier than your old girl away.

460
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,240
I tell you what being on my heart.

461
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,240
I tease my mouth to crack.

462
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,740
In the head's blue.

463
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,440
Bottom out a set.

464
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,860
Lisa If busca not a car.

465
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,060
Super meticulous.

466
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,820
You are almost unable.

467
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,240
Let me tell you something, my brain's been washed

468
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,240
And it's how it was fair

469
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,240
Can't we do what our business is doing

470
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,240
To explain it, damn it's me so fair

471
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,240
Yeah, let me tell you something

472
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
Latter, Jesus freak

473
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,240
I'm just better than you

474
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,240
And now I've got you two

475
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,240
But it's your honor

476
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Won't you have something to do

477
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,240
I see you smell

478
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,240
I'm glad to crack

479
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,240
It's really not a set

480
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,240
I'm so free around most

481
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
Isn't she just like

482
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Janice, Joplin, and Tina Turner

483
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,240
wrapped up in the one hot, sexy bundle

484
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,240
Oh man, I wish I wished

485
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
I could just do nothing

486
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,240
But the daily source code every day

487
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,240
I would put together such a kick-ass show for you guys

488
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,240
It would be so filled with

489
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,240
I just need more time

490
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,240
I need more time

491
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,240
Good morning, my friend Adam

492
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,240
Did you spot him or something?

493
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,240
I was going through

494
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
I was going through

495
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,240
What's your great year

496
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,240
And I love you

497
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
I love you too, man

498
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,240
Meena, thank you so much for checking in

499
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Glad to know you're still on board in Ecuador

500
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Of course you are listening to the daily source code

501
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,240
Kingdom where you are bad

502
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
We are global

503
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
Hey Adam, Monten from Toronto here

504
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,240
I was just listening to DSC710

505
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,240
And I think this is a great time to finally call in

506
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Instead of bugging you by email

507
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,240
You're absolutely right, I'm packaging options

508
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
Being wide open for music and movies

509
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Radiohead and cigarette are both demonstrated

510
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
In late 2007

511
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,240
Radiohead with air in rainbows box

512
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
With LPC diversions of the album

513
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,240
Along with a booklet of artwork

514
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,240
And cigarette are sort of the deluxe edition of

515
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
CD that came with a fact book of photography

516
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
From their Icelandic tour

517
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Both a very limited edition

518
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,240
And eBay re-fail price is a version

519
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Considerably the luxury edition of Hayman

520
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
A currently floating around a hundred bucks

521
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,240
More than triple the original retail price

522
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
And it's just released in late November

523
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,240
It's clearly a strong market for quality packaging

524
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,240
As long as real added value

525
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
And looks pretty fantastic

526
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
The same principle applies to movie

527
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,240
The fact, looking at my library of DVDs

528
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,240
I realised that the majority of them are special edition kits

529
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,240
Many of them have those funky steel cases

530
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,240
And almost all have substantial bonus features

531
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,240
With a movie itself becoming increasingly commoditized

532
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,240
I wonder whether we'll get to a point where the movie is given away

533
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,240
But you go to the store to specifically buy a package with special features

534
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,240
It would definitely be a market sustaining and promoting quality

535
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Filmmaking over cheap feed fill-up tap

536
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,240
And I wonder whether we'd get lines of a radio being made these days

537
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,240
And I glad to hear the lady piers doing better

538
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,240
I love you, I didn't carry it, etc

539
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Yeah, I thank you, well, absolutely

540
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,240
This is part of the conversation I started earlier in the week

541
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Maybe it was yesterday

542
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Early in the week yesterday, whatever

543
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,240
This is clearly what people want

544
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,240
People pay you money for interesting things

545
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,240
And it's not just physical packaging

546
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,240
I think it's also, it's just packaging in general

547
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,240
Virtual packaging is just as valid

548
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,240
And as long as you make it easy

549
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,240
And as long as it's interesting packaging

550
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Do you know that in the perfume industry

551
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
In the cosmetics industry

552
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,240
Which I happen to know a little bit about

553
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,240
My wife had a cosmetics company

554
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Which helped out with from time to time

555
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,240
That the secondary

556
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
You have primary packaging

557
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
So if you have a lipstick as an example

558
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,240
Or if you have a perfume bottle

559
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Sometimes even more apparent

560
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,240
That's primary packaging

561
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,240
The bottle itself or the lipstick dispenser

562
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Think of the secondary packaging

563
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Sometimes just as much money goes into the secondary packaging

564
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Is into the entire fucking product

565
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,240
It's unbelievable

566
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Not quite sure what I was talking about

567
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Because people desire that

568
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,240
They desire the pretty box

569
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,240
So there are ways we can make pretty virtual boxes

570
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,240
And there's a lot more stuff

571
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
When I'm really enjoying seeing

572
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
There's a lot of people who are out there

573
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
Now kind of fulfilling the role of the promoter of music

574
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
And they're figuring out their own business models

575
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
So about three people I know now who are doing that

576
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,240
And it works

577
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,240
And there you go

578
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,240
You've got Princess Ty who Ty Poe I think

579
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Who's always emailing about Sofia Ramos

580
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,240
So it sticks to my mind to get into the email

581
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
From her another update

582
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
Should you actually play some more that angry bitch

583
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,240
And it makes me feel good

584
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,240
And then of course there's guys like Chuck

585
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
Hey Anna

586
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,240
I'm Chuck

587
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,240
Chuck's sending from the Northwest side of Shai Town

588
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,240
Shai Town

589
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,240
I just emailed you to Adamachary.com

590
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
Two audio bumpers

591
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,240
And of course that that was a mistake

592
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
It took Chuck another try

593
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,240
Don't send it to Adamachary.com

594
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,240
Send it to Adamachary.com

595
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,240
Send it to Adamachary.com

596
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,240
From Chrissy Haksha

597
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,240
The

598
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,240
Chance Diva from Opus 3 back in the day

599
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
Remember 1992

600
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
Hell yeah

601
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
Anyway

602
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,240
I just emailed him up to Adamachary.com

603
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,240
I want to make sure you got him

604
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,240
And then I'll give you a little preview

605
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,240
I'll give you a preview

606
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240
Listen to Chuck

607
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,240
Yeah, I'll call

608
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,240
I'll call

609
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
So there you go man

610
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,240
I just shot him off to you

611
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,240
So

612
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,240
Yeah, let me know what you think

613
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,240
Check out our new tunes

614
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
And that's a music network

615
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
She uploaded seven of them

616
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
And we're hooking up some special NGB too

617
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
So stay tuned

618
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
And let me know what you think about the man

619
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,240
Here we go

620
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
All right man, let me mean it

621
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
Great hair, hope you win

622
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
Love you mean it, great hair

623
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
Hope you win, thank you

624
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
That's almost as good as

625
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
Get Cape where Cape fly

626
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
Let me hear that again

627
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
That was pretty cool

628
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
I gotta remember this one

629
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
All right man, love you mean it

630
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
Great hair, hope you win

631
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
I love you mean it, great hair

632
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
Hope you win, absolutely

633
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,240
Hi, this is Kirstie Huckshaw

634
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,240
And we're listening to Adam Curry on the Daily Source Code

635
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,240
See, he sends me the artwork with her

636
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,240
And it's a little DSC logo on

637
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,240
She is beautiful of course

638
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,240
Since my name is something about naked pictures in the title

639
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
He gets me an ID

640
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,240
Of course, I'm going to play this song

641
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:13,240
And then it falls in the country on

642
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,240
And they only blind side

643
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,240
It's all so good dream, don't know

644
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,240
We are made of shapes

645
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,240
Keys who have closed out the freezer

646
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,240
One through his home

647
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,240
But I'm not a taste of

648
00:30:51,240 --> 00:31:05,240
And now I can't hide

649
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:12,240
This blue trail of mine

650
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,240
And I'm happy

651
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,240
But I don't think they can see

652
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Our own place

653
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,240
And you make your bed

654
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,240
And you lie in it

655
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,240
And you fade your head

656
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,240
And we lie to win

657
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,240
And fade and escape all the

658
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:03,240
As we mend to those

659
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,240
Now I can't control it

660
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:16,240
Make you died

661
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:23,240
His blue trail all around

662
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,240
And I don't think they can see

663
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,240
Our own place

664
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,840
I don't think they can't say

665
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:47,040
Oh, I don't think they can't say

666
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,840
Yeah, I could play that. I could accompany her.

667
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,840
Kirstie. Gosh, it's beautiful.

668
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,920
Yeah, we'd make a nice, I wonder what tall she is.

669
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,520
Yeah. Oh, how long for the good old days?

670
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,200
When the talent would just blow the DJ to get their song played.

671
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,360
Yeah, these days you've got to do it with a picture.

672
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,920
Okay.

673
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,920
Kirstie Hawkshia and Meteor's and of course you'll find links to that song

674
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,800
and all the songs played on today's Fubar Friday in the show notes.

675
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,320
A daily source code dot com.

676
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,520
I got some more mellow stuff coming your way.

677
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,160
But first, let's open the door and invite our good friend, John Poledin.

678
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,760
One girl in casting with Adam Curry.

679
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,960
Adam's Mark, you ready to be stumps down?

680
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,800
Because he used the hip dance.

681
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,520
Bring it on.

682
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:57,120
Hey, Adam. This is hit there's number 105 and all of the songs this week are from 1985.

683
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,880
So here we go with intro. Number one.

684
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:11,680
It's all of you for all of you, for all of me. Something like I'd have no idea to number two.

685
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,800
I remember that's so well.

686
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,440
You see this beautiful 35 millimeter camera fall off a camera head in the clip.

687
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,320
Eric Clapton forever.

688
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,440
And then this is number three.

689
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,880
Yeah, you know, no one outside of the Netherlands will probably know that.

690
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,520
Maybe in the UK, that's Princess Sam your number one.

691
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,280
And these are the answers.

692
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,600
This is 9.9.9.

693
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,880
You

694
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,320
All of me for all of you 9.9 and some number one.

695
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,600
And this is engine number two.

696
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,640
This is Eric Clapton.

697
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
Number one.

698
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,000
For every man Eric Clapton is engine number two.

699
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,960
And this is engine number three.

700
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,600
I was right.

701
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,600
This is Princess Sam your number one.

702
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,320
Three.

703
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,040
And Princess, this is engine number three.

704
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,040
And I in this week's hit test and that's number 105.

705
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,080
I almost got it all right.

706
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,080
So Adam, how did you do?

707

Hit test every female dot com.

714
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,440
Info, y'all, dot com.

715
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,400
Jay and P.O.L.G.T dot com.

716
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,400
Take guys, I'll post reviews answers and commentary that cut through the corporate bullshit

717
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
that's into poly the podcast.

718
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,600
Comment over, share a beer, and let's get our geek on over it.

719
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,800
He said nerds dot com.

720
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,120
Hey Adam, this is Josh, one of the judge more on the show in summerville, Massachusetts.

721
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,520
I have a suggestion and request.

722
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,920
I think there's a way we can get the word out about Ron Paul and any other objects of red pill

723
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:31,280
significance using your fabulous voice because I'm an unknown and an unattractive male.

724
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,360
I've decided to enlist the skills of a dear friend of mine out west.

725
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,880
Her name is a leg or west fall.

726
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,920
I believe she'll be able to get the point across to you a little bit more

727
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,360
and joyably at least.

728
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,240
Anyways, I tried to clean up her audio a little bit.

729
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,760
There's some noise in the background.

730
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,920
I used audacity and stuff like that.

731
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,960
Unfortunately, she's not as equipped as some of us podcasters are.

732
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,200
But I hope you'll give her a listen and give her a chance.

733
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,360
Anyway, I love you, Adam Curry.

734
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:01,840
Oh, man.

735
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,400
And that means no homo coming from me.

736
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,000
Back at your mark for a great day.

737
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:06,960
Hi, Adam.

738
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,200
It's a leg or west fall and select city Utah.

739
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,000
Hi, baby.

740
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,560
Rumor has it that you haven't been getting many audio messages from the ladies these days.

741
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,040
Correct.

742
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,360
Correct.

743
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,040
I thought I dropped you a line and make a small request for all the podcasting,

744
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,560
Ron Paul supporters out there.

745
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,280
Many of us have seen your official endorsement of Ron Paul for President on YouTube.

746
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,080
And as beautiful as it is to see you, I think a quick DSC branded Adam Curry sound bite.

747
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,880
Endorsing Ron Paul would be great to hear too.

748
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,240
You know something that podcasters like my friend Josh can stick in their shows or

749
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,120
job in their feeds would be an ideal way to get the word out.

750
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,960
Face it Adam.

751
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,240
Wait, oh wait a minute.

752
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,840
That sounded like she was getting sexy.

753
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,760
That's a pretty good idea.

754
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,000
But I don't just want to do like a high amount of glory.

755
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,320
I want to do some different.

756
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,920
And then cough.

757
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,800
I know you're listening.

758
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,520
Let's do something.

759
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,880
I got to get an named cough credit for for the endorsement.

760
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,560
You know, I called them up and said, all right, man.

761
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,160
Here's what I, here's the outline.

762
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,280
Here's what I want to say.

763
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,840
Now, please put it in a fucking English and he did a great job.

764
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,600
And I feel so part of the system that I have a speech writer.

765
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,440
So name cough, come on, let's do something in audio.

766
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,480
Let's make it cool.

767
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
So the people who were for Ron Paul can use it.

768
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,480
That's a good idea.

769
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,360
And by the way, you'll have to do it on the weekend because I can't ask you this on company

770
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:27,760
time.

771
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,520
So I'll talk to you tomorrow.

772
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,440
No voice carries more authority in the podcasting universe than yours does.

773
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,080
Oh yeah.

774
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:41,200
I figure if hundreds of podcasters can offer awards of wisdom spoken by the pod father himself.

775
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
We can get more people listening to reason.

776
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,040
You've been in doubt with one of the world's best voices.

777
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,760
And we all are not all, baby.

778
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,120
I figured you could do just one of those velvety voice to min show comments that you often do for

779
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,640
other podcasters out there.

780
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,120
I know you're often reluctant to do them, but you know you do them so well.

781
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,320
Please add them.

782
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,560
I love you, Adam Curry.

783
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:09,920
Bye.

784
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,840
Oh, man.

785
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,080
I just got a little tingling in my private.

786
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,560
Who is she?

787
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,560
Send me naked pictures.

788
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,200
Oh, shit, there's my wife.

789
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,520
Hello?

790
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,080
Well, I was just getting really sexy, huh?

791
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,560
Yeah, and then you walked in.

792
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,360
Why are you doing that?

793
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,400
Why are you interrupting the show?

794
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,240
I'm doing the show.

795
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,920
I'm doing a, I'm doing something sexy.

796
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,000
Yes, I had this really sexy girl calling up.

797
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,280
I do have to miss that.

798
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,880
Well, I don't know what are you doing.

799
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,720
Are you in the kitchen making me a meal?

800
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,360
Hey, hi.

801
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,760
So, so while you're making a meal, I'm having sexy talk here.

802
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,280
You want to watch?

803
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,960
Uh, sorry, didn't know that.

804
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,520
It's okay.

805
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,920
Well, I didn't know, but I was right in the middle of it.

806
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,040
And then I heard the door open.

807
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,680
Like, oh, shit.

808
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,400
There's my wife.

809
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,960
Like, you have fucking radar.

810
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,760
Ah, he's thinking of some other woman.

811
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,280
Okay.

812
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:11,920
All right.

813
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,120
So, what was your question, honey?

814
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,200
What? Do you want your food up yet?

815
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,080
Can I, can you wait another like 15 minutes,

816
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,120
and then I'll come downstairs?

817
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,600
All right.

818
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:19,920
Yeah.

819
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,400
All right.

820
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,440
And I'll talk sexy to you.

821
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,640
Everyone's so know how you're doing.

822
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,000
You want to come over here and say hi?

823
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,920
It's Fubar Friday who gives a shit.

824
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,600
I mean, here, hold on a second.

825
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,360
Let me, uh, hold on.

826
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,240
Here.

827
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,040
Have a seat, baby.

828
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,720
Take some headphones.

829
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,400
Okay.

830
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,040
Okay.

831
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,400
I'll prank him up, hold on.

832
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,440
All right.

833
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,000
You got sound?

834
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,480
Is that good?

835
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,440
Tell me one is too loud.

836
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,400
One, two, one, two, two.

837
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,120
It's very loud.

838
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,440
Okay.

839
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:47,840
How's this?

840
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,480
Is that good?

841
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,240
But is a singer doesn't matter.

842
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,600
Look, you want to hear this?

843
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,000
So, I'll just play a little piece, okay?

844
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,400
So, uh, this guy got this group,

845
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,080
because I, you know, women never call.

846
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,840
I don't know if there's any women who listen to my show.

847
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,240
And this, and this guy got some girl.

848
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,840
Does it do a really, you know what I'd say?

849
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,800
You know, you, Adam, you should do like a promo for Ron Paul,

850
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,640
that other podcasters can play.

851
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,440
Okay.

852
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,240
This.

853
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,720
I figure if hundreds of podcasters can offer

854
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,520
words of wisdom spoken by the pod father himself,

855
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,320
we can get more people listening to reason.

856
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,760
Listen, you've been in doubt with one of the world's best voices, Adam.

857
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,920
And we all love how you think.

858
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,920
I figure you could do just one of those

859
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,400
velvety voice to min show comments.

860
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,800
Say you often do for other podcasters out there.

861
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,560
I know you're often reluctant to do them,

862
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,360
but you know you do them so well.

863
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,560
Please, Adam.

864
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,480
I love you, Adam.

865
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,200
Curry.

866
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,440
And I, and I, I got a little tingle in my

867
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:45,920
private.

868
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,120
Did you get it, too?

869
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,040
No, but I can't imagine.

870
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,080
Yeah, I can't imagine.

871
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,280
I know you will.

872
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,720
Yeah, because I know you.

873
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,120
Yeah, and it was like, you know, you're very sensitive.

874
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,000
Yes, there.

875
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,800
I'm very sensitive.

876
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,200
No, especially in your language.

877
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,280
Yeah, what did you hear her?

878
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,160
That was, I know.

879
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,280
She's a beautiful voice.

880
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,480
Yeah, so yeah, so I was just about to say something.

881
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,800
Send me some naked pictures that you walked in.

882
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,680
No, you did not.

883
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,800
Yes, of course I did.

884
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,600
I didn't get it.

885
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,320
Well, I never send them anyway, so I might as well.

886
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,080
So I'm, let me tell you something.

887
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,200
That sounds so old, like you're an old man.

888
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,480
I am an old man.

889
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,840
Can you send me some naked pictures?

890
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,800
I am an old man.

891
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,920
I am an old man.

892
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,440
That's the whole problem.

893
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,120
Well, how would you suggest us?

894
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,560
No, not your young.

895
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,560
But when I was an MTV, when I was younger,

896
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,080
you're still.

897
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,800
I remember I had male bags filled of, of, of, of envelopes before you

898
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,080
feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel,

899
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,280
keep with, feel the, feel, feel.

900
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,800
Don't, don't, don't bust a gut baby.

901
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,280
Easy.

902
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,040
Oh, yeah, we, we don't, we don't want your

903
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,960
spewing out through your holes.

904
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,760
I have a hole.

905
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,720
How's your hole doing?

906
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,760
It's, it's just like, a whale with a hole.

907
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,040
Look, yeah, you got a blow hole.

908
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,000
I got a blow hole.

909
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,040
Yeah, right.

910
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,920
Let's see.

911
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,640
That's it.

912
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,440
It's how it looks.

913
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,640
Blow.

914
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,840
It has a blow hole.

915
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,480
Oh, hand, look at my blow hole.

916
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,240
Oh, can I lick your blow hole?

917
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,240
I want to show you my blow hole.

918
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,200
For all of you who are wondering how the lady Patricia is doing,

919
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,600
as you can tell she's doing just fine.

920
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,960
Now, let me tell you something.

921
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,240
I think I, I, I feel so good.

922
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,920
It's been such a long time.

923
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,520
Now I remember how it was to feel good.

924
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,040
I had just to feel healthy again.

925
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,640
Yeah, because you get used to it.

926
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,320
Yeah, what used to feeling healthy?

927
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:34,960
Feeling shitty?

928
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,920
A feeling shitty, yeah.

929
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,400
There's about a year baby, but are you, and you know what?

930
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,760
Everyone suffers with you.

931
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,800
Really?

932
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,880
I mean, I don't mean that in a bad way.

933
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,480
I was acting very happy.

934
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,240
But you cannot fool us.

935
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,160
We know, and do you feel even a different vibe

936
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:50,960
in the house already?

937
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,000
Oh, yeah, you're happy now.

938
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,880
Of course I'm happy.

939
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,080
But now I know why.

940
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,200
What did you think?

941
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,800
I just walked into you.

942
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,280
Because, yeah, I'm having sex,

943
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,040
yeah, I'm having sex with my, with my listeners.

944
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,440
No, but I was happy before that, too.

945
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,000
Oh, okay.

946
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,960
Uh, it's so good to have you on the show, babe.

947
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,920
Oh, yeah, ratings.

948
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,280
I just want ratings.

949
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:13,920
Uh-huh.

950
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,480
I don't see Adam Curry busted by his wife.

951
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,680
Can I give them to you?

952
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,800
I was about to go cyber.

953
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,320
You are a ratings bananza.

954
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,840
Whenever you're on the show, it's almost double the amount of downloads.

955
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:29,440
Yeah, people like me like to hear me talking down to you.

956
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,520
Yes, yeah, yeah, they want to hear that.

957
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,760
Put me into, keep me in line, absolutely.

958
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,720
Yeah, kick him.

959
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,960
Right, would you have not done successfully yet?

960
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,840
Although, but walking you know, on the side of her sex talk?

961
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,600
Yeah, that was, that was what we'll talk about.

962
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,800
That's a fucking radar, man.

963
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,680
I'm telling you.

964
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,560
I want you to, if we do do me favor, just listen to this one,

965
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,120
this one song is one artist, tell me what you think of her after that,

966
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,400
and then I'll let you go.

967
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:50,880
All right.

968
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,600
Yeah, okay.

969
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,600
Baby, I should let him take my clothes off.

970
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,040
And baby, I should let him stay alive.

971
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:10,320
I'll think of that, leave my vehicle together.

972
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,560
Oh.

973
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,360
I guess we'll never know until we try.

974
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,520
Could you be the one that I've ever looked at for?

975
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,960
Oh, you just don't know the one that's nothing I'm at though.

976
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,560
I'm giving you the chance to show me how it looks.

977
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,080
Why I think I'm ready to know you think you're good enough?

978
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,600
If you play your country, this dress might be the night.

979
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,600
I lose my ambition

980
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,600
I've been gone for so long

981
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,600
If this feeling is too long

982
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,600
I won't be thinking of the same one

983
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,600
And I'm really feel

984
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,600
That I don't do bad rail

985
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,600
But apart of me's coming under

986
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,600
You're going just like

987
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,600
And it might be the time

988
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,600
I'll show you why we'll become

989
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,600
Maybe I should let him get to know

990
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:16,600
Maybe I should make him start a slowly

991
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,600
I'm kind of big, he never thought

992
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,600
He'd get to see

993
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:29,600
I'm thinking that we better together perfectly

994
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,600
Could you be the one

995
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,600
That I've been looking for

996
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,600
Are you just another brother

997
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,600
And I can have my dog

998
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,600
I've given you the chance

999
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,600
To show me how I am

1000
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,600
I'll punch one

1001
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,600
It's just my feeling

1002
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,600
I lose my ambition

1003
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,600
I've been gone for so long

1004
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,600
If this feeling is too long

1005
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,600
I won't be thinking of the same one

1006
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,600
And I'm really feel

1007
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,600
That I don't do bad rail

1008
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,600
But apart of me's coming under

1009
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,600
You're going just like

1010
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,600
And it might be the time

1011
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,600
I'll show you why we'll become

1012
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,600
Maybe I should let him get to know

1013
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,600
Maybe I should make him start a slowly

1014
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,600
I want to treat my thing

1015
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,600
I'll love you

1016
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,600
But maybe I should do

1017
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,600
I'll keep it to myself

1018
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,600
Because I don't know

1019
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,600
If it's too long

1020
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,600
I'll feel the same

1021
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,600
I lose my ambition

1022
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,600
I lose my ambition

1023
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,600
I've been gone for so long

1024
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,600
If this feeling is too long

1025
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,600
I won't be thinking of the same

1026
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,100
I'll fight in those

1027
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:03,060
I'll punish all these Re kunne

1028
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,600
It's just my feeling

1029
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,600
I've been gone for so long

1030
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,600
If this feeling is too long

1031
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,600
I'll get to know

1032
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,600
I'll be working on all this

1033
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,600
I lost my…

1034
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,600
It's my feeling

1035
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,600
that I lose my ambition

1036
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,600
I've been gone for so long

1037
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,600
If this feeling is too long

1038
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,600
I won't be thinking of the same one

1039
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,400
I want you here, but I love you, be real

1040
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,600
I want to be strong enough

1041
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:38,600
You can win just like anyone in the time

1042
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:46,600
Maybe I should just say goodbye

1043
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:53,600
It's about a minute and a half too long

1044
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,600
For my

1045
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,600
It's a little bit too long

1046
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,600
Isn't that amazing?

1047
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,600
Isn't that amazing?

1048
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,600
Her name is Sarah

1049
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,600
S-E-R-A

1050
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,600
I don't know, let me read from the bios

1051
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,600
On the Podship Music Network

1052
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,600
As a singer-songwriter musician

1053
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,600
The creative edge of Sarah

1054
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,600
Points to this young artist deep roots

1055
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,600
And colorful background in the American South

1056
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,600
An hour from New Orleans

1057
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,600
There's a town called Burus, B-U-R-A-S

1058
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,600
Name for her grandfather

1059
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,600
Who settled there from France

1060
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,600
Let me see, she has a Myspace page, I guess

1061
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,600
Let me say

1062
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,600
Wow

1063
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,600
She looks pretty

1064
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,600
Very pretty

1065
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,600
That's not true

1066
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,600
And it's not like

1067
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,600
Christina Aguilera

1068
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,600
No, she has a different sound

1069
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,600
She has a very interesting sound

1070
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,600
Actually I had to think

1071
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,600
And I hope she's not going to be angry with me

1072
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,600
There is a sort of a sound from Brittany

1073
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,600
But Brittany would love to sing like this

1074
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,600
Yeah, right

1075
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,600
I'll look, she's pretty

1076
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,600
Oh, she's lovely

1077
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,600
Well, she could be a big star

1078
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,600
Why not?

1079
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,600
Let's see, that's the first sound

1080
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,600
It's sweet, yeah

1081
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,600
Amazing, huh?

1082
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,600
Yeah, beautiful

1083
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,600
Beautiful

1084
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,600
This is such a pity

1085
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,600
This girl like that should be

1086
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,600
As famous as Brittany

1087
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,600
And see what a stupid Brittany does

1088
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,600
And she should

1089
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,600
She throws it away

1090
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,600
Well, you know, she should start by not wearing any underpants

1091
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,600
Pana?

1092
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,600
Why?

1093
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,600
Well, she's saying she could have Brittany's career

1094
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,600
So she should start by not wearing any underpants

1095
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,600
That's a good start

1096
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,600
Don't start

1097
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,600
Come a little closer to the mic, huh?

1098
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,600
I'm not hearing you very well today for some reason

1099
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,600
Oh

1100
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,600
No, well for sure

1101
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,600
In that amazing

1102
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,600
And she doesn't need that

1103
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,600
Because she can sing

1104
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,600
Wow

1105
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,600
She doesn't need to take over

1106
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,600
So this is Jay Ragusa

1107
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,600
Adam, big fan since episode 365

1108
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,600
Okay, no naked pictures

1109
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,600
But Adam, let me tell you this girl is awesome

1110
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,600
I met Sarah while

1111
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,600
What did you say?

1112
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,600
Well, back

1113
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,600
Fucking Google, I can't read it

1114
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,600
Fuck is this

1115
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,600
Okay, he met her

1116
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,600
Here we go

1117
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,600
I met Sarah while back

1118
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,600
And I'm solely responsible for posting some of her stuff on the PMM

1119
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,600
She's unsigned

1120
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,600
No record deal, huh?

1121
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,600
And I want to promote her

1122
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,600
Because I really think she's great

1123
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,600
Please check it out

1124
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,600
My favorite is funky love

1125
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,600
You might like airplane ride

1126
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,600
And so this was actually different one

1127
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,600
This was

1128
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,600
So you can download her

1129
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,600
Well, you go to the link in the show

1130
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,600
No, it's a deadly source code.com

1131
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,600
And you can go

1132
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,600
Don't everybody download her

1133
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,600
Because she's fantastic

1134
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,600
You can play

1135
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,600
You can play it online

1136
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,600
You can't download it

1137
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,600
Maybe from her my space page

1138
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,600
I don't know if she's selling it or not

1139
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,600
I don't know

1140
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,600
It doesn't matter

1141
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,600
Go play it in your show

1142
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,600
Yeah

1143
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,600
Well, fuck I mean

1144
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,600
Awesome

1145
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,600
And fuck idols

1146
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,600
Excuse me

1147
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,600
This girl's amazing

1148
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,600
Why no

1149
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,600
Fine house

1150
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,600
Fuck her too

1151
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,600
Fine, I was fine

1152
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,600
Fine, I was fine

1153
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,600
Fine, I was fine

1154
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,600
Oh, I'm so irritated by her

1155
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,600
But she's sick, huh?

1156
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,600
She has a

1157
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,600
She's a dick she has addictions

1158
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,600
This is an illness

1159
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,600
They're so talented

1160
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,600
They get the chance

1161
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,600
Well, no one's helping her out

1162
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,600
Everyone's laughing at her

1163
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,600
Pointing at her

1164
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,600
This is so fucking typical

1165
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,600
Where are you going

1166
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,600
How do you know

1167
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,600
How do you know

1168
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,600
Because I know

1169
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,600
This is what happens every single time

1170
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,600
All over so-called friends

1171
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,600
You know

1172
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,600
It's true

1173
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,600
What they say

1174
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,600
None of their friends are now around

1175
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,600
I'm going to ring her bell

1176
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,600
And say, hello

1177
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,600
I'm Patricia

1178
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,600
I'm going to help you

1179
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,600
Yeah

1180
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,600
Oh yeah

1181
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,600
My point is

1182
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,600
If no one, it's like everyone

1183
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,600
I think she has friends

1184
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,600
I think she doesn't want to get out

1185
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,600
Because they always say

1186
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,600
They need to help themselves

1187
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,600
They need to

1188
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,600
They have to hit rock bottom

1189
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,600
Yeah

1190
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,600
But the unedipidious

1191
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,600
Her chances are over

1192
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,600
You know

1193
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,600
It's done

1194
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,600
I disagree

1195
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,600
I disagree

1196
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,600
She can totally come back

1197
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,600
She needs to get

1198
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,600
Make Ronson

1199
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,600
That producer dude

1200
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,600
On the case again

1201
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,600
Who wrote half of the songs

1202
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,600
I think that's what he's called

1203
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,600
Make Ronson

1204
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,600
Yeah

1205
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,600
Yeah, he's the guy produced it

1206
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,600
He was on the

1207
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,600
Nevermind the buzzcocks

1208
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,600
I'll let that make Ronson

1209
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,600
Yeah, yeah

1210
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,600
Are you sure this name is me?

1211
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,600
I have no fucking idea

1212
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,600
Make Ronson

1213
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,600
It's a guitar player

1214
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,600
I have no fucking idea

1215
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,600
From David Bowies

1216
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,600
I can look it up

1217
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,600
If you give me a second

1218
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,600
Hold on

1219
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,600
That's what I know

1220
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,600
Producer Amy White

1221
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,600
That means

1222
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,600
This guy is not dead

1223
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,600
No

1224
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,600
No

1225
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,600
Mark Ronson

1226
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,600
Mark Ronson

1227
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,600
What did I say?

1228
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,600
Make Ronson

1229
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,600
Make Ronson

1230
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,600
No Mark Ronson

1231
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,600
Good job

1232
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,600
Mark Ronson

1233
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,600
From the seven

1234
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,600
That guy's good

1235
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,600
Yeah

1236
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,600
And young and good

1237
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,600
Good looking

1238
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,600
Okay

1239
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,600
We've had enough of you now

1240
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,600
You're talking about good looking guys

1241
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,600
Time to go

1242
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,600
Really?

1243
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,600
You're going on a stay

1244
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,600
I'm just going to play some depressing stuff

1245
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,600
Okay

1246
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,600
Okay

1247
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,600
All right

1248
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,600
You want to stay?

1249
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,600
No

1250
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,600
No no it's okay

1251
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,600
Okay

00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,600
Misses Jones

1271
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,600
You've got a lovely blow hol

1272
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,600
Do the do the do

1273
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,600
Give me some wine

1274
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,600
Okay

00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,600
I love you too

1276
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,600
All right

1277
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,600
So

1278
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,600
I will wait until you hear the door closed

1279
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,600
Then we can continue

1280
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,600
Bye

1281
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,600
Love my wife

1282
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,600
She's not

1283
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,600
All right

1284
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,600
Just what is this is

1285
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,600
You know the other day I was talking about

1286
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,600
Just a switch gears here for a second

1287
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,600
A man the show is going to be so long

1288
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,600
I don't know if anyone gives a shit

1289
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,600
It's food bar Friday who cares

1290
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,600
So the other day I was talking about

1291
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,600
Gates the minister defense for the US

1292
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,600
And he was quoted in the Los Angeles Times saying

1293
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,600
That the coalition partners in Afghanistan

1294
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,600
We're not equipped for

1295
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,600
Counter-Insurgence

1296
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,600
Operations

1297
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,600
And it was it was a real insult to the other countries who were there

1298
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,600
And as it turns out Britain

1299
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,600
The Netherlands

1300
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,600
And Canada

1301
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,600
Because that's the one I couldn't come up with

1302
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,600
I had them Daniel from Toronto Canada

1303
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:20,600
The third country you're looking for in Afghanistan is Canada

1304
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,600
Where we lost 77 soldiers are up to now

1305
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,600
And actually, which is interesting

1306
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,600
The

1307
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,600
Canada is the country in charge of the southern region

1308
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,600
Which was on the criticism that

1309
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,600
From that US general

1310
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,600
So that news

1311
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,600
Been pretty much from page news today in Canada

1312
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,600
And we even got the

1313
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
College from the US ambassador's Canada

1314
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,600
So to send you that Canada is still up there

1315
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,600
Doing their part

1316
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,600
Thanks, bye bye

1317
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,600
You know what I've tried to do as much research as possible

1318
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,600
There's not been a lot of reporting on this specific topic

1319
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,600
But from everything I can gather and there's not been no

1320
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,600
Retraction from the L.A. times

1321
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,600
What what Gates said is exactly that

1322
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,600
And it was insulting

1323
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,600
And it really gave me yet another

1324
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,600
You know peak underneath the curtain

1325
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,600
Of how these guys are operating

1326
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,600
And you know I'm raising some questions

1327
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,600
Like what the

1328
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,600
Thank you hon

1329
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,600
Didn't even hear you sneak up on me

1330
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,600
Thank you

1331
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,600
What is this?

1332
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,600
What is this hon?

1333
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,600
Hold on, what is this?

1334
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,600
Whites, symphonials

1335
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,600
Children, why?

1336
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,600
American wine

1337
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,600
Children, why?

1338
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,600
Yeah

1339
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,600
Amateur wine

1340
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,600
Amateur wine

1341
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,600
It's nice and refreshing

1342
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,600
Yeah, nice

1343
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,600
Nice and bubbly

1344
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,600
Mm-hmm

1345
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,600
Okay baby, thank you

1346
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,600
15 minutes, yeah

1347
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,600
All right

1348
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,600
Okay

1349
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,600
There we go

1350
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,600
Um

1351
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,600
I was going to say

1352
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,600
You know, it's really insulting

1353
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,600
And you know, Britain, yeah

1354
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,600
I understand Canada, the Netherlands

1355
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,600
Those are the only other two coalition partners

1356
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,600
I mean, you have to say that pretty much

1357
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,600
U.S.

1358
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,600
Ascissors, the government's at least

1359
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,600
So that makes total sense

1360
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,600
Um

1361
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,600
What the hell are we doing there?

1362
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,600
What is actually happening?

1363
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,600
What is the mission?

1364
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,600
How can we measure success?

1365
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,600
It's not still looking for bin Laden

1366
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,600
We put $10 billion into Pakistan for that

1367
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,600
Oh, please, please vote for Dr. Ron

1368
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,600
Ron Paul, bring it, you know

1369
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,600
You may not agree with everything at the end of the day

1370
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,600
I'm sure that if we, you know, no matter who becomes president

1371
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,600
We can, of course, effectively

1372
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,600
Start to control our Congress

1373
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,600
If we really got off our asses

1374
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,600
So we'll be able to, you know, it doesn't really matter

1375
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,600
It doesn't matter anyway

1376
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,600
Let's just get this guy in

1377
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,600
Because, you know, he will take everyone out

1378
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,600
You'll take all the troops coming home

1379
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,600
Stop

1380
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,600
I'm fucking sick and tired of it

1381
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,600
I

1382
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,600
They

1383
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,600
Can we just do something sweet?

1384
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,600
Nice

1385
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,600
Adam, hi, Dave Petersen here

1386
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,600
And I'm kind to ask for

1387
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,600
Um, a little assistance

1388
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,600
My triplet three, eight-year-old daughters

1389
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,600
Um, have been given a little school project

1390
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,600
Called pets around the world

1391
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,600
And it's a

1392
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,600
Wait, wait

1393
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,600
You say you have triple eight-year-old daughters

1394
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,600
Dude, let me hear that again

1395
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,600
A little assistance

1396
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,600
My triplet three, eight-year-old daughter

1397
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,600
Oh, dude

1398
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,600
Shepo Ba

1399
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,600
Um, my hat is off to you, my friend

1400
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,600
Triplet eight-year-old girls

1401
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,600
Woo hoo

1402
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,600
Here is a father

1403
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,600
It was calling out for help

1404
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,600
Let me know

1405
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,600
I'm listening, my friend

1406
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,600
Um, have been given a little school project

1407
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,600
Called pets around the world

1408
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,600
And it's a, they're given a small stuffed animal

1409
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,600
And, uh, in a journal

1410
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,600
And what they're, to do is to send a

1411
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,600
stuffed animal in a journal together

1412
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,600
To somebody who will then take a picture with them

1413
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,600
Or, you know, do something with them

1414
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,600
And then send them onto somebody else

1415
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,600
And eventually, uh, we would, you know,

1416
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,600
The ultimate goal obviously is to, uh, have this pet

1417
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,600
Travel around the world to make it back

1418
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,600
To the space for their home playing party in April

1419
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,600
And this is why I thought, uh, of you

1420
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,600
You're a lot more well connected

1421
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,600
And in fact, actually thought of your daughter

1422
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,600
Maybe Christine would like to help out

1423
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,600
But, uh, anyway, I sent you an email

1424
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,600
With, uh, with my contact information

1425
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,600
If you would, uh, like to, or you could go to my blog

1426
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,600
Which is, uh, www.dipstick.com

And I can contact them

And, uh, we're looking for three people to start this

Uh, I love you, I don't agree

01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,600

Uh, as long as I can remember to put a link in the

1441
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,600
Show notes to your blog post

1442
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,600
That will be okay

1443
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,600
Alright, I gotta wrap this up

1444
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,600
We're over an hour already

1445
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,600
This is one of the longer shows

1446
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,600
That I've done in a while

1447
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,600
I had a lot of fun though, good to have petritioned drop by

1448
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,600
That was kind of cool

1449
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,080
Oh, here's something we haven't done in a while,

1450
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:17,880
mine is what they would know.

1451
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,080
It's Friday.

1452
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,080
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday,

1453
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:27,880
food about Friday and a final thought of the week.

1454
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,760
Well, I just kind of moved stuff around because, you know,

1455
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,120
I don't always have the final thought.

1456
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,800
And in fact, I don't think it up because

1457
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,880
it wouldn't be the final thought.

1458
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,000
Now, what it is, it's literally why I'm feeling

1459
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,720
at the end of the footballer festivities.

1460
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,960
And it is the final thought of the week.

1461
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,760
Today, I have a comment, which really the whole comment

1462
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:53,080
is a theme for the comment of the week.

1463
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,480
And what we really should be happy for.

1464
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:01,200
Hey, head of this is David from the Sound of the Us podcast.

1465
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,480
Just Google Sound of the Us.

1466
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:07,120
He'll be able to find me, PhD, OS, ultimate combination

1467
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,680
of music and biology.

1468
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,840
We have some pretty good discussions on the show.

1469
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,640
Anyway, I just wanted to comment on your talking about your wife

1470
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:16,360
being ill.

1471
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,760
I think two of them had an ill wife for quite a while.

1472
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,200
Actually, she's finally getting better.

1473
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:26,320
But she had ulcerative colitis pretty severely.

1474
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:30,760
And in 2006, she had her colin removed.

1475
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:34,400
Which she had what is called a total collective meat.

1476
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,680
Her entire large intestine was removed.

1477
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,360
So we've been dealing with that.

1478
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,480
And hopefully, we'll have a follow-up surgery schedule in spring.

1479
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,360
But I just want to be like, you know,

1480
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:49,960
I totally empathize with the having a sick wife thing.

1481
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,120
It really sucks.

1482
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:56,800
And just any advice I can give you, which sounds like you're

1483
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,280
you guys are doing so much better now.

1484
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,720
But any advice I can give you is simply

1485
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,440
to love or with all you got and be there for.

1486
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,000
So I really enjoy the show.

1487
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:12,920
And I'm kind of in and out of the podcasting radar.

1488
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,760
It seems like I'm off and off because of my busy hectic life.

1489
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,520
But I'd love for you to check out the sound of the house.

1490
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,080
I believe it's a sound of the house.

1491
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,160
That my podcast dot to come.

1492
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:27,320
If I remember correctly, that tells you how I'm into it.

1493
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,040
So anyway, love you.

1494
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:29,760
Not home home.

1495
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,760
Bye.

1496
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:35,400
All right, man, I really appreciate that that call because it does, of course,

1497
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:40,600
once again help me realize how incredibly fortunate I am in my wife is

1498
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,560
once again, to have good health.

1499
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,400
So I wish good health to you and your wife.

1500
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,320
And of course, everyone who listens to the show.

1501
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,520
So, man, let's be healthy for 2008, okay?

1502
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,520
We've had a lot of crap.

1503
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:56,120
We off to a rocky start and now we're ready to take this year head on.

1504
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:59,000
And that my friends is the final thought of the week.

1505
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,080
And with the final thought, I think we need a final song.

1506
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,960
So I think eight minutes or something like that.

1507
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,360
So I'm just going to leave it all the way to the end and kick back.

1508
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,360
Now, I'll touch you guys next week.

1509
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,360
Live life with passion and joy and spirit.

1510
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,280

1514
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:44,200
The reason that we hear, the reason that we feel I feel too warm

1515
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:48,400
There's won't disappear

1516
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,400
I have, after the love game, I can play

1517
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,400
All our illusion were just a parade

1518
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:03,400
And all the reasons are still on the plane

1519
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:08,400
And in the morning when I rise

1520
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,400
No longer feeling it's my time

1521
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:16,400
But the reason, the reason, the reason

1522
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,400
And the power, the power

1523
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,400
After all, the reason

1524
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,400
All the reasons are still on the plane

1525
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:34,400
And in the morning when I rise

1526
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,400
No longer feeling it's my time

1527
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:47,400
And in the morning when I rise

1528
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:55,400
No longer feeling it's my time

1529
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:02,400
Oh baby, I can't find a reason

1530
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:06,400
Why my love, it won't disappear

1531
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,400
Can't find the reason

1532
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,400
Why I love you

1533
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,400
Hey, hey, I love you

1534
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:28,400
Oh baby, I can't find a reason

1535

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
