42
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:19,900
Oh man, this whole Freddie Mac, Fanny May, better known as Fraudian Fony, this whole bailout situation, it's, first of all, completely un-American, although I understand where the coming from, but bailing out enterprise, even though it's a so-called GSE, it was never really made clear if this government sponsored enterprise, if it really hasn't implicit or explicit backing from the federal government, well now of course we know they do,

43
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:30,900
the treasury wrote a $200 billion check to both of these companies, and it's open-ended because a lot more can happen, and a lot more needs to take place, how you feel in today?

44
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:49,800
You feel in good after this exercise, the treasury and the federal reserve went through this past weekend, I don't know about you, but I'm having trouble sitting down from this flaming hot poker that's up my ass, because I am one of the many Americans, millions who will be paying for this, for the bailout of these two companies, and you're right, my friend of there in Seattle,

45
00:07:49,800 --> 00:08:18,800
sorry, Portland, yeah, they talk about cronyism, I read another name, one of the guys who's going to be taken over as intra-manager, he's from the Carlisle group, right, that's the Bush hedge fund empire, Carlisle group, it's like, there's so open about it, so blatant, it's not, and then, you know, how do the world leaders feel about what's going on, well they feel great because they're, you know, those the guys that get basically got bailed out,

46
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:38,800
I see leaders from Japan, word from China, oh yes, this is great, we love it, this is exactly what needed to happen, well, you know you're getting screwed with those guys are happy about it, you just know you are, meanwhile, as your mortgage gotten any cheaper, I mean, significantly, is anyone still willing to lend you money?

47
00:08:38,800 --> 00:09:05,800
G, did your house price go up? No, of course it didn't, this is, this is just an atrocity, is what I call this, and I don't even understand how far all of this can go, but some good links on the drop from Bloomberg, certainly a credible source, investors, maybe, and I've been talking about this one for a long time, investors, it says maybe forced to settle contracts,

48
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:16,800
protecting more than $1.4 trillion of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds against the default, after the USC's control of the companies and a bid to bolster the housing market.

49
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:34,800
So this is these, these derivatives, which, you know, the word already says it, it's a derivative of the actual security, so it's little bits and bobs and pieces, and the entire derivatives market is just so huge, it doesn't just deal with, it deals with currencies, not just mortgage back assets,

50
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:59,800
but we're talking hundreds of trillions of dollars in total, so now, what I understand from this is that the international swaps and derivatives association, because this stuff is really fuzzy, these derivatives, okay, it's a guy's college up on the phone and hey, I got 8 billion of these, yeah, I got he billion of those, well, let's just do a swap, I'll say the facts later, but because, because of the fact,

51
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:14,800
this conservatorship, basically, these companies being more or less nationalized, but certainly bail out sounds too light, you know, it sounds like your, your skiff is filling up with water.

52
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Ooh, let's bail it out, no, this is stealing hundreds of billions of dollars from the American taxpayers, let's just call it theft.

53
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:34,800
But anyway, this theft apparently does trigger what they call a credit event, which means that they have to settle all of these, all of these trades, these swaps,

54
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:49,800
at least that's what the international swaps and derivatives association is calling for, and nothing of this size has ever been settled ever before, so, and I'm sure there's not going to be a hell of a lot of news about it until it all goes horribly wrong.

55
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:58,800
September 30th, I think, is when the U.S. closes its financial books for the year, and that's probably when we'll see that we're just bankrupt.

56
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:06,800
I think, you know, as far as I'm concerned, the federal, you know, the deficit rose by five trillion dollars.

57
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,800
I mean, these these companies, these phony and fraud.

58
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,800
They are, they're bankrupt, so all that debt just being passed right on to us, yes, sure.

59
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:34,800
There's all kinds of fuzzy words about, we get first money out and investors, they got to take some pain, but, you know, when I saw the premier of Japan Prime Minister, when I saw him yesterday, I didn't have to understand what he was saying.

60
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,800
I knew he was happy. All these guys are happy, because they saved their own asses.

61
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Let's see, lots of links about this event, and it's just fascinating to follow, because this is purposely, I think, being held away from us.

62
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Please, don't look at Wall Street, don't look at the markets, go look at the hurricane or anything else.

63
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Hey, we'll invade a little country there next to Russia, just so you don't have to look at what's actually going on.

64
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Now, this is spreading.

65
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Now, this is a great link, and of course, all of these links can be found in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com or curie.com.

66
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:20,800
This is, this is actually sourced from two Dutch newspapers as the President of the Dutch Central Bank, now Dvelling,

67
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,800
said what we've talked about before here on the Charlie, so this pertains to Europe pay attention.

68
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:34,800
He said, in the financial times, the Dutch financial times, you know, jailed dogblood.

69
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Here's the quote, it's translated, of course.

70
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,800
The European Central Bank cannot continue forever to provide liquidity to banks with money market problems.

71
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,800
It says not Bill, like President of the Bank of the Netherlands, and board member of the ECB in an interview with a newspaper.

72
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:56,800
If we see that banks have become very dependent on central banks, then we must encourage them to tap other sources of funding.

73
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,800
This means that shareholders in extreme cases must come up with money.

74
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:08,800
So, just echoing that the system is not, it's broken, but not just at the fraughty and phony level.

75
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,800
It's broken all across the board, because these banks have been able to just go to their central banks and get money.

76
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,800
It awesome loans, cheap, and who's going to be paying for all of the bailouts?

77
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,800
You know it, luckily I pay taxes in the United States, and in the United Kingdom, part of Europe.

78
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
So, groovy.

79
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,800
I get two flaming hot poker, and this is the thing that really, this really blew me away.

80
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Because, of course, I was watching to see what would happen when the markets opened yesterday, Monday.

81
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,800
And as predicted, financial stocks went soaring.

82
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:52,800
But what happened in London was outrageous, and you've got to think that there's definitely something very fishy with this.

83
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,800
The London Stock Exchange broke.

84
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Okay, there was a computer error, which, or they call it, computer failure, left them unable to trade for seven hours.

85
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,800
Now, this can only be a couple of things. First of all, I think it sabotage right off the bat.

86
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:18,800
It had to be something where either the US markets wanted to, it could just be greed, which is very likely.

87
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Hey, let's not let those fuckers do anything.

88
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:28,800
It could have been, perhaps, to stop the possibility of even settling swaps.

89
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
That's, you know, the story we just talked about.

90
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Those swaps typically are done between New York and London.

91
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
So that could have been it.

92
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,800
It could have been just an honest computer mistake.

93
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:46,800
But somehow, you know, the timing of it, just after markets opened, it was for seven hours,

94
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,800
meaning the traders could only get in on some action at the very end of the trading day.

95
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,800
No, this sounded like this sounded to me like massive sabotage.

96
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,800
I hope someone has some more information on it, or some more info comes out.

97
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Let's be on the look on that.

98
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,800
For any kind of news about what happened with the London Stock Exchange.

99
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Because that just feels to me like not only was it was the whole financial industry,

100
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,800
shoving it up our butts, but they were also fucking with each other.

101
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
That's what I think.

102
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Adam, Eric and Portland.

103
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Ah, shit. Sorry, Eric, we already got you.

104
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Now I was going to go to our, one of our financial savons from run to gold dot com.

105
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Here we go.

106
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Hi, Adam is the monetary scientist from run to gold dot com.

107
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
I'm Adam.

108
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
In DSE,

109
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:37,800
787, you mentioned some gold bars.

110
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,800
And it's good to see a little bit of the peer coming back.

111
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Anyways, we should keep in mind that sound money is what protects against despotic

112
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
inroads by government.

113
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,800
And we really all need to run to the gold to reclaim a lot of our liberties.

114
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,800
And it's good to see the transformation in the show since the awakening has happened.

115
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Well, I'll tell you, I've been coming very interested in gold ever since I found out that

116
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,800
it's actually quite hard to get your hands on it.

117
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,800
And you can get all kinds of pieces of paper that say that you own some gold,

118
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
but actually getting the gold in your hands.

119
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Hey, very interesting.

120
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Not that easy to do, which means other people are onto this strategy,

121
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,800
probably people with a lot more money than you and I.

122
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Anyways, some really big things are happening in the financial markets.

123
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
And pretty much being taken over by the government.

124
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,800
They're going to be pumping in tons and new treasures to buy all that garbage dead,

125
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,800
and whatnot, which is just, oh, it's such a mess.

126
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Anyways, a lot of those, as much as I hope they're financial assets and whatnot, are safe.

127
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,800
It's important to keep in mind that there's about 140 ounces of paper gold,

128
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
or everyone ounces of physical gold.

129
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
So it's getting a little difficult to actually get.

130
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Anyway, let me just, let me just get that.

131
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,800
So this is the same fucking game those guys are playing.

132
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:02,800
So there's about 140 ounces of paper gold, which means, you know, just like for,

133
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,800
for every dollar, the bank holds, they can lend out.

134
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,800
Well, it used to be 10, but it's probably more like 30 dollars now.

135
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
Who knows what those limits really are.

136
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,800
But for every bar of gold that you buy in paper, 140 ounces,

137
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,800
there's only really one ounce to back it up.

138
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
That's what I mean.

139
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,800
But the real deal, you know, just want to get the pieces of paper,

140
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
if you're really into this strategy.

141
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
It's a good physical position and metal.

142
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,800
I talk about it a lot of my site, Renicle.com,

143
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,800
how to properly purchase your metal and whatnot.

144
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Anyways, I've got a quick, I want to play from McElene,

145
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,800
speak with commentary about this.

146
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,800
We have an interesting market, Danny, I'm like,

147
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,800
wouldn't be obvious to really anyone on the street today.

148
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,800
But with all of our primary dealers, the market makers,

149
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,800
for the physical metals, we're looking at four to six week delayed deliveries

150
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
on almost every product.

151
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:05,800
And we're looking at something as generic as a cruiser and had its wholesale market premium.

152
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Generally, on the wholesale market, I can invite that for half a percent

153
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
to 1 percent above the spot price.

154
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
It's now 4 percent.

155
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,800
It's moving to the extra 300 basis points higher.

156
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,800
And it's still on a four to six week delayed delivery.

157
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,800
What we're watching happening very curiously,

158
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,800
whereas this in the commodities realm,

159
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,800
you end up having a bifurcation where the paper asset world

160
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,800
that the paper side of the trade, well, that's futures or options,

161
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,800
there is a run towards liquidity.

162
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,800
But there's no liquidation in the physical markets.

163
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,800
In fact, there's more supply going off the market than the market.

164
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
You can really even handle.

165
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,800
There are no secondary market quotas.

166
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
And this is what I mean.

167
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,800
So it's getting really hardy at physical metal.

168
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Anyway, it's great here.

169
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,800
We're keep it up, run to gold, and they work for us.

170
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Hell yeah.

171
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Keep reminding them.

172
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,800
They work for us, whether you got a pen, a microphone, a camera,

173
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
keep reminding them of that.

174
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
So there you go.

175
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,800
This is the game that's been played around us for decades,

176
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
that I never knew about it until the past,

177
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
really the past year that I started fighting you.

178
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,800
I guess you kind of know where you think about it.

179
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,800
And once you understand how truly evil some of these people are

180
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,800
that are just evil due to greed, by the way.

181
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
And that's the whole financial industries.

182
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Evil due to greed.

183
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,800
They make their money up front when you give it to them.

184
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,800
That's what a great scam.

185
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,800
But then this whole business of being able to lend out

186
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,800
a multiple of what you actually have.

187
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Do you see it?

188
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Do you see how that's wrong?

189
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,800
It's like me, I can't even do it.

190
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,800
I don't have the right to print paper, but I guess you could print

191
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:02,800
IOUs for the same services over and over and over again.

192
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
It's like a lot of businesses.

193
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,800
It's almost like a fractional jet ownership in a way.

194
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
And here's how that works.

195
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
You have a couple of planes and you have many more passengers

196
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,800
and fractional owners than you have planes.

197
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
This is how net jet works.

198
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,800
And so the whole idea is to set up the right computer system

199
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,800
so that you can manage everyone's flying.

200
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
And it's about positioning.

201
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,800
But at the end of the day, it's like the sewage system.

202
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,800
You don't expect everybody to flush the toilet at the same time.

203
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
If everybody flush the toilet at the same time,

204
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,800
there would be shit flowing through the streets.

205
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Now there's all kinds of models for that.

206
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
And that's well understood.

207
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,800
And this has been working for quite a while in the financial markets.

208
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,800
But at a certain point, you just flush one time too many.

209
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
And then the shit comes up anyway.

210
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
It was just too much of it.

211
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Too much flush and going on.

212
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Hi.

213
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Well anyway.

214
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
We'll see where it all lands.

215
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Right now we're sitting on the flaming poker.

216
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,800
And our destiny is literally at the hands of Paulson and Bernanke.

217
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
And let's see how well they do.

218
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,800
But remember those names because your grandkids certainly will.

219
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Gives me some.

220
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Put back.

221
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Hi Adam.

222
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
It's Matt from Gamesweasel on this week's show.

223
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
We review Final Fantasy IV on the DS.

224
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Also Tiger with PGA 209 on the Xbox 360.

225
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,800
You can win copies of the brand new wrestling game, TNA impact.

226
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,800
And then Judy Dench tells us about the new James Bond video game.

227
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,800
That's all it gamesweasel.com.

228
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Alright.

229
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Matt Cuddle.

230
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Of course, a new sport out as well.

231
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,800
I think he's got some on that next week.

232
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
I'm not a gamer at all.

233
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Don't own a game console.

234
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,800
But once in a while I see a trailer and like wow.

235
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
There's no wonder that shit's bigger than the movie industry.

236
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
That's just amazing.

237
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
What the stuff is being made.

238
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Hey, let's talk about the MTV video musical words for a second.

239
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,800
I had a chance to see them last night because they were delayed by a day due to time zone differences

240
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
with the United States.

241
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Of course, I spent seven and a half years at MTV in the formative years.

242
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Mine and MTV's in the mid-80s to early 90s.

243
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,800
And a couple of things that I just wanted to mention first of all.

244
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,800
When you know, you have to understand that the VJs were never really invited to the video

245
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
musical words.

246
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,800
You know, I usually got in, but only with a ticket to sit in the crowd.

247
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,800
And I had to, you know, beg borrow steal to get a ticket for Patricia because you usually, of course,

248
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
you'd fly out with me if we were in Los Angeles.

249
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,800
And I would usually be out there because we'd do the countdown to the, you know, order the top 20 videos

250
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
to the countdown to the video musical words.

251
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,800
We do all kinds of location-based shows with some of the people who were performing.

252
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,800
You know, there was a lot of programming surrounding the video musical words.

253
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Musical programming, by the way.

254
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:10,800
One thing that is just so interesting to me personally is that everyone's calling it the VMAs.

255
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Because when we were at MTV, you were for, it was for Bowton.

256
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
You were not allowed to call it the VMAs.

257
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,800
I have no idea why, but you had to say video musical words.

258
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,800
And in the hallways at MTV, in Memos, we all call it the VMAs.

259
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,800
And even the artists were instructed, you may not call it the VMAs.

260
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
I think there might have been some kind of copyright thing.

261
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,800
There must have been some other something that was called maybe there was a,

262
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,800
that didn't want to confuse it with AMAs for the American musical words or whatever it was.

263
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,800
But it's just interesting to see that everyone's not calling it the VMAs,

264
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
which I thought was a stronger brand anyway.

265
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Because it just kind of rolls off the tongue.

266
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
MTV's VMAs.

267
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
The VMAs.

268
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,800
It sounds good.

269
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
About the show itself, I have no idea how it did in the ratings.

270
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Actually, I should have looked that up.

271
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,800
It just kind of happened because there was so much going on with the,

272
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,800
the Democratic National Convention, the Republican National Convention,

273
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,800
hurricanes, war.

274
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,800
You know, it's like, oh yeah, and then there's the VMAs.

275
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,800
First of all, it was directed by Joe De Mayo,

276
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,800
who was, I think Joe was an associate producer when I was at MTV.

277
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,800
So I was very proud to see his name on the credit list as the director.

278
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:28,800
By the way, an associate producer pretty much gets the scripts from the printer and gets coffee.

279
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,800
That's about what you do as an AP at MTV.

280
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:40,800
And so I have to say the whole vibe of the show was it looked great.

281
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Now, the part of that I think was Joe because I know Joe's been around.

282
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
He really gets it.

283
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,800
He's got music and is coursing throughout his veins.

284
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Also, of course, it was a perfect set.

285
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
It's being the paramount lot.

286
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,800
So they had, you know, all in fact, all kinds of great sets.

287
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Well, that stuff's made for being lit well.

288
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,800
And the lighting was also, probably most cases pretty spectacular.

289
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Some of the performances I didn't think were lit that, you know, really that well.

290
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,800
But what the hell was this show?

291
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I mean, I really, it baffled me.

292
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Patricia and I were just sitting there.

293
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,800
I mean, the best thing about this show had to be Russell Brand.

294
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Russell Brand, who I know quite well from what it is work over here.

295
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,800
I think he really took that bull by the horns.

296
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
He went full steam ahead.

297
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,800
It was, first of all, his opening monologue where he started riffing on Bush.

298
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,800
And, well, praising Obama.

299
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,800
But it doesn't really matter what he, you know, who he stands for.

300
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,800
But basically what was kind of interesting is he was an English guy saying,

301
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,800
Please, on behalf of the rest of the world, get this Republican dickhead out.

302
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Get someone in whose different.

303
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,800
And what was funny was the apathy of the crowd.

304
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Now, maybe this is just the way it was shot.

305
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,800
But the apathy of the people sitting there in the audience who are mainly industry

306
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Insiders, advertisers and their kids, you know, it's like those are the people that come

307
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
to these award shows.

308
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
And they were like, huh.

309
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Uh, he's talking politics.

310
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
This is a music show.

311
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
He didn't be talking.

312
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,800
And the awards used to be at all, all awards shows used to be a perfect opportunity

313
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,800
for someone to grab the stage and say something about the state of the world.

314
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
So good on your Russell brand.

315
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,800
I mean, unfortunately, you lay a lot of trust in Obama.

316
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,800
But good on you for coming out and saying, hey, this is messed up.

317
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
You guys are messed up.

318
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
We wouldn't trust Bush with a pair of scissors.

319
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
That was pretty funny.

320
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Uh, so I thought Russell was good.

321
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Really, really good.

322
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Not too pretentious, just wacky, rock and roll.

323
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
And he was the most dangerous thing of the show.

324
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
This show was once again completely safe.

325
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Safe, safe, safe.

326
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
There was no danger whatsoever.

327
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,800
And really it was, you know, half the show was Disney Channel.

328
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Everything from the Jonas Brothers to Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera.

329
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,800
That's all Disney kids to hip hop.

330
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,800
You know, and we're so noticeable.

331
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,800
How MTV has changed in a such a bling culture channel.

332
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,800
When you get kid rock, who, who pop in a kid rock has been touring around the world.

333
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
So he's got his band.

334
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
They're tied.

335
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
He's, you know, his vocals are special.

336
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
He was the best singer of the whole evening.

337
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Now Leonuluus was actually pretty good too.

338
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,800
But in general, I mean, you know, he was a kick-and-tune.

339
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
The audience was dead.

340
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Completely dead.

341
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,800
He should've been grabbing his crotch like a little will or whatever his name is.

342
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,800
I'm just, and that to me said it right there.

343
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
You know, rock don't write.

344
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
That's what we say in the music business.

345
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
It doesn't rock and roll, doesn't get ratings.

346
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,800
And so that's why MTV moved away from it completely.

347
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,800
That was pretty much the only rock performance that I can recall in the entire show.

348
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:59,800
And then you have that pretentious Christina Aguilera elevator thing, you know, whatever.

349
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,800
She's got to watch it because the Disney police will come and get her.

350
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,800
She's had her baby and now her hips are big.

351
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
And she's masking it.

352
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Not that I give a shit.

353
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,800
But, you know, the Disney police, they're going to come for her if she doesn't slim down.

354
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
That's, that's a huge machine, man.

355
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,800
That machine put Britney Spears back on the map by giving her three awards, including best

356
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
video of the year.

357
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
What a scam.

358
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,800
That's the same people who brought to you by the same people who brought you the, the phony and

359
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
fraughty bailout.

360
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Here's the MTV video music awards and Britney Spears completely mind controlled at this

361
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
point.

362
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,800
I don't know if she's on drugs or if they put a chip in her head.

363
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:43,800
But any normal person would have said, hey, you know, I've had a really challenging

364
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
year.

365
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Thank you for standing by me, you know, all the people who are around me, who love me, who

366
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,800
really, you know, had my best interest at heart.

367
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
I mean, all of that stuff.

368
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
None of it.

369
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,800
The same rehears speech.

370
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Thank you.

371
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,800
I want to first of all, I want to thank God and I want to thank my record company.

372
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
And I want to thank the fans.

373
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Three times in a row, the exact same thing.

374
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
The girl is sad.

375
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
She's mind controlled.

376
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,800
And who the hell gives out these awards at MTV?

377
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Where's that blue ribbon panel?

378
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,800
The disgusting.

379
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,800
And just because they still have this pretentious attitude that they're the shit when

380
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
it comes to music.

381
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Bull.

382
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,800
Now, not to say that they didn't make the right choices from a business perspective to go

383
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,800
to, you know, a longer form programming.

384
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,800
Half hour shows my sweet 16 in my ride, cribs.

385
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
It all started with a remote control.

386
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
Remember that Ken Ober.

387
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Harry War.

388
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:43,800
And, uh, uh, was, uh, was my guy's nice Steve, Steve Trickus, and the band.

389
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
That's when they started getting 1.0 ratings.

390
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
They don't get those anymore, by the way.

391
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
They do get some, like, tea or tequila.

392
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
That's a big show for them.

393
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,800
So, from a business standpoint, makes total sense.

394
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,800
But please, fuck off with your music awards.

395
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,800
That's bullshit.

396
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
I found this on the podcast.

397
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,800
I'd say the music now work, which I thought would be a proper po for this particular moment

398
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
in today's Charlie.

399
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,800
This is for all you people sick of hearing about Britney.

400
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
Oh, baby, baby.

401
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:21,800
My sisters have been babies.

402
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,800
And driving my Mercedes.

403
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Oh, baby, baby.

404
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:32,800
What's it till when I awake?

405
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Should I stay with Kimberly?

406
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
What was I doing?

407
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,800
And getting with Lindsay, the one.

408
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,800
Let's watch it have the best.

409
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
Why need some help?

410
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Some medicine or a pill?

411
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,800
I don't want no time to feel.

412
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
Dr. Phil.

413
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,800
When I get no attention, I'll teach my mind.

414
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:08,800
It's such a sin for them to be none, to be live.

415
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
I'm not a girl.

416
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,800
I get a woman give me a sigh.

417
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,800
Help their baby one more time.

418
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Oh, baby, baby.

419
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
I'm new.

420
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,800
I was losing my mind.

421
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Mary Kevin Federaline.

422
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Drinking and smoking.

423
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Oh, my two favorite joys.

424
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,800
That's why I lost my two boys.

425
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
What was I doing?

426
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Hard in and the rock scene.

427
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Now I take a paparazzi.

428
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
I need some help.

429
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Some medicine or a pill?

430
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
I call my friend.

431
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,800
A pair is hell too.

432
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,800
When I get no attention, I'll teach my spouse.

433
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,800
I even blew a Mickey Mouse.

434
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
And the Disney crew.

435
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
I'm not a girl.

436
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,800
I get a woman give me a sigh.

437
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Help their baby one more time.

438
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Oh, baby, baby.

439
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,800
I used to be so melodic.

440
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Then I filmed Cayalex.

441
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
Oh, baby, baby.

442
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,800
I never used that to drugs.

443
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Now I listen to bone thugs.

444
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
What was I doing?

445
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Shopping and buying earrings.

446
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Should've been at court hearings.

447
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
I need some help.

448
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,800
Some medicine or a pill?

449
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,800
Before I jump.

450
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Of the winter's sale.

451
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Winter's sale.

452
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:10,800
When I get no attention, I'll go to bed.

453
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Do something like, share my hair, share my hair.

454
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,800
I'm not a girl.

455
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:23,800
I got a woman give me a sigh.

456
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,800
Help their baby one more time.

457
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,800
Little skank.

458
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Oh, man.

459
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Matt Sterman, the Britney Spears song.

460
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Oh, boy.

461
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Hey, you two can be like Britney just joined the MK Ultra program.

462
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,800
They're firing that up here in the United Kingdom.

463
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,800
I came across that you're going to love this.

464
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Listen to what they've developed now.

465
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,800
Remember now, we, of course, are all supposed to be very, very afraid of the,

466
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:58,800
depending doom of the avian bird flu, the H5N1, which, of course,

467
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,800
you need the actual virus to create the anti virus.

468
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,800
And now, in the United Kingdom, they're coming out with the universal one hit

469
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,800
wonder.

470
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,800
One flu vaccine is good enough for life.

471
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
You never get sick again.

472
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Uh-huh.

473
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Uh-huh.

474
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,800
I'm at the Jenna Institute at the University of Oxford.

475
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Now, researches here are working on vaccines.

476
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,800
Talk a bit about the way.

477
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,800
This is BBC.

478
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,800
BBC News links in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com and at curie.com.

479
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,800
It's HIV, TB, malaria, and influenza.

480
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Now, there's already a very good flu jab and millions of people in the UK around

481
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
the world have one each winter.

482
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
But in effect, that's part of the problem.

483
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Okay.

484
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,800
So, flu jab, obviously, for those of you not familiar with the Queen's English,

485
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,800
is a hypodermic needle in your arm.

486
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,800
A flu jab sounds much kinder that way, doesn't it?

487
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,800
We need to have the jab every year because the strain of flu shifts a little bit.

488
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,800
But researches here are now trying to create a universal flu vaccine, which

489
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
wouldn't need to be repeated every year.

490
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Now, with me is Professor Adrian Hill,

491
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,800
the director of the General Institute, Professor Hill,

492
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,800
how much of a breakthrough would it be to have a universal flu jab?

493
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Well, it could change things dramatically in two ways.

494
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Nice biking, by the way, BBC.

495
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,800
He sounds like shit.

496
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
It's funny.

497
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,800
You see this video, which is a part of the link I'll put in the show notes.

498
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,800
The guys sitting there pretending to look through a microscope and then the presenter

499
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
does a little walk about.

500
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
He walks from one side to the other side and he ends up.

501
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,800
Oh, and here he is, Professor Hill.

502
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,800
And the guy, go, oh, oh, you're filming?

503
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
You wanted to ask me something. Oh, yes.

504
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Well, let me tell you about this mystical flu jab we have in the works for you.

505
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
My prettis.

506
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,800
Asking, we would be able to vaccinate people and have some confidence that if a new pandemic

507
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,800
comes along, even a pandemic of birth, which is what people are really worried about.

508
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
We would have an accident that would work again.

509
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,800
Okay, there you go.

510
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,800
So, what are you saying?

511
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,800
And what this article is setting us up for is,

512
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,800
we're going to get vaccinations against the bird flu.

513
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,800
This is the flu that has killed no more than 150 people worldwide.

514
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,800
And we don't actually have a sample of the virus.

515
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,800
And it's supposed to be, you know, the virus being the kind that goes from human to human,

516
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
not just bird to human.

517
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,800
If that's even true.

518
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,800
So it sounds like these guys have it in this lab where he's working.

519
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,800
He must, if he's going to create the universal jab.

520
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
That new strain.

521
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Hopefully, but that's something we're missing today.

522
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,800
And in terms of convenience, as well, it would mean you wouldn't have to have your jab every

523
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
autumn.

524
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Yeah, something flu is extraordinary in that it's one of the very few vaccines

525
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,800
where we have to keep giving it because the virus shifts and changes.

526
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Over the years, so it's recommended you have a different flu vaccine every year.

527
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,800
We could get away with giving one vaccination and then it might last a life.

528
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,800
And in terms of how it works compared to normal vaccines, tell me about that.

529
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,800
And scientifically, that's what's really so important here.

530
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,800
For years, we have used vaccines that work through antibodies.

531
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,800
And most of the vaccines on the market today were designed to do exactly that,

532
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
like the existing flu vaccine.

533
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,800
What we're trying to do here is develop a fundamentally different sort of

534
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,800
vaccine that works through cellular immunity.

535
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,800
So we induce lots of white blood cells that will kill early infected cells.

536
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,800
And if that technology works for flu, it could be really important for other globally

537
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,800
diseases like malaria, HIV, like tuberculosis.

538
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,800
And it's even being used to try and treat cancer to those.

539
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
Yeah, okay.

540
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
So I don't believe one bit of this.

541
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,800
And I think we need to be very, very careful when the government says,

542
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,800
Oh, we've got this fantastic wonderful new system.

543
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,800
And it's just one little jab.

544
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,800
You won't feel a thing.

545
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,800
You know, there's nanotechnology that experimenting with and checking that into people.

546
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,800
You know, this could easily be some kind of RFID dust.

547
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,800
Yeah, you think I'm coming up with all kinds of wacky cookie stories, maybe.

548
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
But I think you need to be very awake.

549
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
And by the way, flu is not bad.

550
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
Get the flu.

551
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,800
Okay.

552
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
Just get it.

553
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
I had it took me 36 hours.

554
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Patricia got it.

555
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
Christina got it.

556
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
You know, makes you stronger.

557
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
My in laws both 82.

558
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,800
They didn't get it.

559
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Why?

560
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
Because their immune system is strong.

561
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,800
They've had probably every, every freaking flu flu known to man.

562
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,800
And they're from the old days.

563
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,800
Be very, very careful when the government suggests they want to inject you with something.

564
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,800
Choco heads, please be very, very careful.

565
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,800
Moving on.

566
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,800
This is just nice contrast to the.

567
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
The bailout.

568
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,800
The skiff is filling up with water.

569
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,800
To the phony and fraughty bailout.

570
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,800
This is not getting a lot of coverage.

571
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Although I've seen it mentioned here and there.

572
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,800
But the US transportation secretary, Mary Peters,

573
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,800
that said, you know, we, we, hello.

574
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,800
While you guys are bailing out your buddies there for 200 billion,

575
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,800
just as a starting point, we are, we need $8 billion to fix our roads.

576
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,800
We need 2.7 billion immediately.

577
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
Immediately.

578
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,800
We need money desperately because they can't.

579
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
The projects are going to stop in the United States.

580
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,800
Bixing of roads, building of roads.

581
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,800
You know, this is, I think Ron Paul has said this a couple of times.

582
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,800
You know, we spend billions overseas to build bridges in countries we don't live in.

583
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,800
Meanwhile, our bridges and roads are falling down here at home.

584
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Perfect example.

585
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,800
No one's talking about it.

586
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,800
Billions are needed.

587
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Last night, Patricia and I were, um,

588
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Blaine and bed watching the news.

589
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,800
Yeah, we still trying to go to bed at a reasonable hour around midnight, I'd say.

590
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,800
And I don't know if you caught this.

591
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Um, it may be in the, in the papers in the U.S., it should be.

592
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,800
Uh, they sentenced three, uh, and I haven't sentenced the, um,

593
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:03,800
found three of the, I think was eight men conspiring, uh,

594
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,800
to, uh, blow up airplanes that you probably remember the story.

595
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,800
This is from, I think 2006, all of a sudden there was big news.

596
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,800
They'd, uh, foil this terrorist cell who were planning on blowing up airplanes, uh,

597
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,800
in trans Atlantic flight, mainly American airplanes.

598
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,800
Um, and they were going to do that with liquids.

599
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,800
This is the whole reason why you can't take more than, uh,

600
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,800
a hundred milliliters of anything on board an airplane because of these guys.

601
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,800
And here's what's really interesting.

602
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,800
They were indeed convicted of a three of them only, by the way,

603
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,800
not the ring leader and not all of them.

604
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,800
They had to let three of them go.

605
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,800
Three of these guys were convicted, uh, of conspiracy to murder.

606
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,800
This was the five-month trial they had plenty of time.

607
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,800
And what the jury would not convict them of, what they could not convict them of,

608
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,800
is that they intended to target transatlantic jets.

609
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,800
Uh, now these, you know, there's some circumstantial evidence.

610
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,800
I'll clear the guy, the guys, these guys were up to no good.

611
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
They were making, uh, bombs.

612
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Well, they had the ingredients at least to make bombs.

613
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,800
I don't even know if they actually made anything that, uh,

614
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
wasn't in an, uh, explosive state.

615
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
They did have the ingredients.

616
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,800
Um, but, you know, the, you know, from the circumstances talking about that,

617
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
they want to blow up a power station.

618
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,800
And, uh, maybe an oil refinery or storage tank.

619
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,800
No proof whatsoever about transatlantic jets.

620
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Can we please now go back to normalcy where we don't have to do this idiotic shit of, of,

621
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,800
of carrying on little, little, little plastic baggies of crap.

622
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,800
And can we just admit that that was bullshit and wrong?

623
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
That's the proof is here, right?

624
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,800
Even the sun, uh, links in the show notes.

625
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,800
Even the sun can't get around it.

626
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,800
So what was interesting last night is we're watching television.

627
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,800
The same day that they convict these guys.

628
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,800
The news media had amazing footage.

629
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,800
They had, you know, they're inside the house where these guys were.

630
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,800
They had undercover footage because the cops had been in and, uh,

631
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
the terrorist anti-terrorist brigade.

632
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,800
And they planted, uh, cameras and they had that footage.

633
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,800
And they had, uh, just amazing amounts of information, uh, beautiful scans.

634
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,800
High quality video that these guys had laying around.

635
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,800
And this was a full on beautifully edited piece.

636
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,800
I don't even think it was BBC.

637
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,800
I think it might have been, uh, Channel 4 ITV.

638
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
I have to go back and look.

639
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,800
But everyone had great footage, great pieces.

640
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,800
I'm thinking, how do you get access to all that material?

641
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,800
How do you get the access?

642
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,800
I think it's only because there's, it's an embarrassment.

643
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,800
You know, that all the rigmarole we're going through.

644
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,800
Yeah.

645
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,800
So these guys definitely were up to no good.

646
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,800
I'm glad they got them.

647
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,800
And they were onto the system working that regard.

648
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:55,800
But then this whole fucking security, the airport's being so idiotic.

649
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,800
Which you can't stop anyway.

650
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,800
It's just terrorizing the passengers.

651
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,800
You know, maybe they just needed to make a lot of noise.

652
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,800
Because, you know, this is almost like the Georgian thing.

653
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,800
Where Georgia snuck into south of city of first before Russia retaliated.

654
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,800
But the new story is pretty much Russia's the bad guy.

655
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,800
And here it is.

656
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
Oh, these are the guys that wanted to blow up the planes.

657
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Um, they didn't, they can't actually prove they wanted to do that.

658
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,800
But they had, uh, they had, uh, fertilizer.

659
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:29,800
And, uh, hydrogen peroxide.

660
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:35,800
Anyway, it's, uh, it's a war for your mind, my friends.

661
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,800
That's what it is.

662
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,800
There are no secrets, only information you don't yet have.

663
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,800
Again, good on the guys for stopping, uh, for stopping these guys from continuing

664
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,800
whatever their plans were.

665
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,800
But if I have to hear one more time in a new story that they had,

666
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,800
links to Al Qaeda, it's just as bad as a bailout.

667
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
Oh, I've got some links.

668
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,800
There's a hyperlink, a space link, a telecommunications link.

669
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,800
And what kind of link is that?

670
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,800
What the hell is that all about?

671
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,800
Hi, this is PW Fencing.

672
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,800
Sometimes the truth is something you're just not ready to learn.

673
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,800
That's the subject of the latest digital flotsom.

Check it out at digitalflotsom.org.

675
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,800
Just don't bring the kids this time.

676
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,800
Uh, you'll understand when you get there.

677
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,800
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

678
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
I love it when PW here's the call to action.

679
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,800
I told you I'd play any promo.

680
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,800
If you just throw it up on the drop drop.au slash daily source code.

681
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,800
Happy to do it.

682
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,800
Uh, different kind of music day in the Charlie.

683
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,800
It's kind of my, uh, 70s, uh, porn vibe that I'm in.

684
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,800
It's cast-handly easy to love on Charlie seven eight eight.

685
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,800
Yes, I do.

686
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,800

So we say, so we say,

792
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,800
So we say,

793
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,800
You won't be there,

794
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,800
I'll miss this moment,

795
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,800
I'll string a test or two,

796
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,800
From fandom to life,

797
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,800
Is that a bug?

798
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,800
And then I'll head on my end,

799
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,800
Why does it seem too good to be true?

800
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,800
Because you also eat it,

801
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,800
So I'll be there,

802
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,800
I'll be there,

803
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,800
I'll be there,

804
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,800
I can help me

805
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,800
If you can,

806
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,800
I'll be there,

807
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,800
I'll be there,

808
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,800
Test Henley,

809
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,800
And it's from the pod state music network,

810
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,800
I gotta tell you,

811
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,800

T-minus one told you at the top of the show,

820
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,800
Tomorrow, Big Bang Day is a BBC Radio 4 is calling it,

821
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,800
The Large Hadron Collider in Geneva.

822
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,800
Part of the big, certain project will start to fire up.

823
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,800
I don't know if they're,

824
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,800
I think they're not actually smashing any Adams starting tomorrow,

825
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,800
but they do crank it up in that thing.

826
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,800
Oh, I guess just keep spinning through October

827
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,800
when they really expect to do some massive stuff.

828
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,800
So the BBC is teeming up with Sern.

829
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,800
They've got the going to do a live webcast.

830
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,800
They've got Radio 4.

831
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,800
We'll be covering it all day, I guess.

832
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,800
Hey, this is interesting.

833
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,800
I just, I tell you,

834
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,800
I tell you, they have pictures of all the scientists.

835
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,800
Interesting, interesting.

836
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,800
Once this torch would.

837
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,800
Okay.

838
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,800
So that fires up tomorrow.

839
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,800
So we'll have to see, of course,

840
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,800
what that does.

841
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,800
I still find it very amazing.

842
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,800
So this thing is it's been years in the making.

843
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,800
$8 billion is what it's cost up to date.

844
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,800
At least that's the published figures.

845
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,800
And over 30 countries participating in the funding of it.

846
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,800
Now, I know a lot of countries, certainly Western Europe,

847
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,800
have strong Christian Democratic representation.

848
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,800
How can I never heard any debate about this?

849
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,800
Because this thing is supposedly what they're looking for

850
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,800
is the Higgs boson, which is some kind of particle that

851
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,800
or state, I guess a particle that existed milliseconds

852
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,800
or even less than milliseconds right after the big bang.

853
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:32,800
So this is, you know, creationist versus evolution.

854
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,800
And how can all these Christian Democrats have approved all the spending

855
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,800
without at least some debate about why they're spending money

856
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,800
and going after something they don't believe in?

857
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,800
That's the kind of stuff that just makes me so suspicious

858
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,800
of what this is really all about.

859
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,800
Anyway, we'll know tomorrow.

860
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,800
I'll get up right in early.

861
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,800
So I'll see any black holes.

862
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,800
I'll try and speak out or show before I think horrible happens.

863
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,800
Some other good alternative energy stuff.

864
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,800
And this is such a fantastic idea.

865
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,800
Unfortunately, the inventor of this, as it usually goes with,

866
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,800
with alternative energy solutions.

867
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,800
And this is something called wave partner.

868
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:22,800
Invented by Stefan Neistrum.

869
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,800
And it's a very ingenious idea.

870
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,800
And I encourage you to take a look at the links.

871
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,800
They actually, well, they don't have the whole system set out.

872
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,800
But apparently the guy was actually, I think it was killed in Ghana

873
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,800
where he was testing it out.

874
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,800
His idea is, you put a whole bunch of balloons in the ocean.

875
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,800
And this is a very simplistic version of it.

876
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,800
And the balloons are attached to a wire.

877
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:50,800
And the wire goes down to the bottom, where basically you have the kind of generator of unit.

878
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,800
And these balloons, of course, move with the motion of the ocean.

879
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,800
And with that, if you have the right gear, you, in a very simple way,

880
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,800
you can transform that into power generation.

881
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,800
And you know, he did it all a lot of the work.

882
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
And there were a lot of people very interested.

883
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,800
This is the way it always goes with alternative energy.

884
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,800
Because, you know, when you come up with such a great idea,

885
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,800
the first thing you got to forget is making money with it.

886
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,800
Because if you think you could make any money with it, you're definitely getting killed.

887
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,800
Then if you can actually promote it and market it.

888
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,800
So it catches on or someone builds it or it's easy enough for people to build themselves.

889
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,800
Yeah, you'll get threatened by industry.

890
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,800
And these are the thugs.

891
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,800
The same guys with that Ponzi scheme called Federal Reserve Banking.

892
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,800
But I did love this next idea.

893
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:45,800
And this is presuming that the carbon dioxide really is an issue.

894
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:50,800
Cloud seeding ships could combat climate change.

895
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,800
And this is a pretty interesting idea.

896
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,800
The National Center for Atmospheric Research and Boulder.

897
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:06,800
I've come up with this idea of spraying salt water into the air from unmanned sailing ships on the Atlantic.

898
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,800
And that that would essentially, you know, they've got their calculations.

899
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,800
And it would only take like a couple thousand, I think.

900
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,800
It didn't seem like the hand to have.

901
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
Yeah, 1500 ships.

902
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:23,800
And by having these 1500 ships, spouting salt water, which is pretty beautiful in the ocean, into the air,

903
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,800
which would cost about each one to two million pounds.

904
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:33,800
So between two and four million dollars, they could completely reverse the carbon emissions issue.

905
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,800
Which by itself is interesting if that's all it takes.

906
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,800
How big is this issue really?

907
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:44,800
But another thing this coolest is the sales that they have on these unmanned ships.

908
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,800
Just take a look at this thing.

909
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,800
It's kind of like futuristic sci-fi towers.

910
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,800
But as a sailing exercise, it looked interesting.

911
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,800
I wouldn't mind having a sailing ship without the sheets and a rope with one of these, you know, sticks on it.

912
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,800
It looks like it might kind of work differently and more cool.

913
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,800
But interesting from psychics world, oh, some sorry, psychics.

914
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,800
Physicsworld.com.

915
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:14,800
And then finally for today, just trying to give you a nice overview of the news, what's really taking place.

916
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,800
Because most people, of course, are paying attention to the news about Sarah Palin.

917
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,800
And this is the most audacious act I've ever seen in my life.

918
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,800
This is from the Financial Times, Georgia.

919
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:32,800
Our buddy, soccer is really the Ty Eaton Terrent from Georgia.

920
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,800
It's taking Russia to court.

921
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,800
So they're taking Russia to court for attacking them.

922
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,800
So the things that are interesting about this, first of all, they're taking them to the world court.

923
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,800
I mean, do you see Starfleet command?

924
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,800
Do you see how this now actually fits together?

925
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,800
I mean, this is, that's just going to be a joke.

926
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,800
So who are these guys?

927
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,800
And it's in the Hague, of course, in the Netherlands.

928
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,800
Pussy ass country when it comes to this kind of stuff.

929
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,800
Oh, yeah, I just bring them over here.

930
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,800
No one will pay attention to this little dinky ass pimple of a country.

931
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:08,800
Oh, just so we get everyone in black robes and white ties.

932
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,800
And we got ourselves a world court.

933
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:17,800
But the audacity of Russia to do, if they have a real hearing, then of course, what should come out is,

934
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:23,800
well, actually it was Georgia who attacked South the city of first and then Russia retaliated.

935
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:28,800
If that comes out of this, I'll say, all right, World Court, you've done something good.

936
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
But do you really think that's going to happen?

937
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,800
And what is the point?

938
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,800
What is the point?

939
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,800
One thing I know for sure, Putin has given NATO 21 days.

940
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,800
This is probably only about 16 of those left.

941
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,800
21 days to get out of the,

942
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,800
as the Caspian Sea, where they are, the Black Sea, to get out.

943
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,800
Because, of course, we've gotten, you know, our motto there at this point.

944
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,800
And all these things come in together.

945
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,800
So that'll be around the end of September.

946
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,800
The US closes its books around the end of September.

947
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,800
We got a couple weeks of very interesting financial markets.

948
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,800
Who knows what's going to happen with the US election?

949
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,800
But know that we are awake.

950
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,800
You're listening to this show.

951
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:15,800
You're awake.

952
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,800
We're getting more information.

953
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,800
We're sharing it.

954
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,800
We've got great tools for that.

955
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,800
It's drop.io slash daily source code.

956
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,800
Before I forget, it's a bookmarklet.

957
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,800
You can use, which is really handy.

958
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,800
You just drag that into your browser bar and then any page you're on.

959
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:35,800
If you want to submit that into the drop, you just click on that bookmark.

960
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,800
It'll give you a little, you know, the, it'll fill out the URL and the name of the page.

961
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,800
You can even add in some comments.

962
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,800
It's fantastic.

963
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,800
Please use that upload stuff.

964
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,800
And find some good pod safe stuff to upload there.

965
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:56,800
A little tired of all the licensed music going up, which I keep having to figure out and remove whatever possible.

966
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:02,800
But anyway, we are awake and we're making more and more people awake.

967
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,800
Tell them to listen to this show.

968
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,800
Tell them to listen to no agenda.

969
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,800
There's plenty other places where you can actually find out what's going on in the world.

970
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,800
You know, the real news.

971
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,800
Please tell people to turn off the televisions.

972
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,800
It's really not helping.

973
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,800
It's really, that really pulls the wool over your eyes even further.

974
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:27,800
So with that, we have one more track to play.

975
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:32,800
Yet again, something for my fishing expedition on the pod safe music network.

976
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,800
I just like the dynamics of the piano.

977
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,800
Don't Oxford.

978
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,800
He's my baby.

979
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:43,800
Somebody's got to tell me.

980
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:50,800
Where my baby lays his head.

981
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:56,800
Because it's the nas and weak spots for sure.

982
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:02,800
Since he's been sleeping in my bed.

983
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:07,800
He's got to know I got to know I got to know.

984
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,800
He's got to know.

985
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:16,800
If he's still in love with me.

986
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,800
I was in his with another woman.

987
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:26,800
And he's closing round the wrong tree.

988
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,800
He's my baby.

989
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,800
I love that man.

990
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,800
He's my baby.

991
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:40,800
Oh, I got to call him on the telephone.

992
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,800
He's my baby.

993
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,800
He's my baby.

994
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,800
He's my baby.

995
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:48,800
Why?

996
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,800
I can't wait.

997
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:57,800
Now I moved over the mountain.

998
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:09,800
Across the river to the sea.

999
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:14,800
Just to be closer to my baby.

1000
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:21,800
He moved his heart away from me.

1001
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:27,800
I remember like it was yesterday.

1002
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:35,800
He said that he loved me.

1003
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,800
And now my heart is aching.

1004
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:45,800
There's pain where his love used to be.

1005
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,800
He's my baby.

1006
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,800
Oh, I love that man.

1007
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,800
He's my baby.

1008
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:58,800
Lord, he knows how to make my body full.

1009
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,800
He's my baby.

1010
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,800
He's my baby.

1011
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,800
Why?

1012
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,800
I feel full.

1013
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:46,800
If you see my baby.

1014
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:53,800
Walk in round town on the arms of another girl.

1015
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:58,800
Or you tell him how he hurt me.

1016
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:03,800
And he destroyed my whole wide world.

1017
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,800
He's my baby.

1018
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,800
Oh, I love that man of mine.

1019
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,800
He's my baby.

1020
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,800
Oh, I got to call him.

1021
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,800
He knows how to make my body full.

1022
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,800
He's my baby.

1023
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,800
He's my baby.

1024
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,800
Why?

1025
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,800
I feel so lonely.

1026
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,800
He's my baby.

1027
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,800
Oh, I love that man of mine.

1028
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,800
He's my baby.

1029
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,800
Lord, I got to call him.

1030
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,800
He's my baby.

1031
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,800
He's my baby.

1032
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,800
He's my baby.

1033
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,800
He's my baby.

1034
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,800
Why?

1035
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,800
I feel so lonely.

1036
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:53,800
Sing it again.

1037
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:58,800
Don't Oxford.

1038
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,800
He's my baby.

1039
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:07,800
So I just want to remind you, you really are free and you are.

1040
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:15,800
All that captivism that's all in your mind is whatever the mind control is that they're sending to you.

1041
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:20,800
So all you want is a white pick of fence and Britney Spears.

1042
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,800
You don't need to buy the crap.

1043
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:24,800
Absolutely.

1044
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,800
Look out for the crap they're trying to sell you.

1045
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:32,800
Go buy some fresh fruits and vegetables, will you?

1046
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:37,800
And please enjoy your freedom because you really, really, really can.

1047
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:42,800
And since the human residents of the earth is rising with fantastic rate, I just like to say,

1048
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:46,800
keep the vibe alive and whatever you do live your life with passion.

1049
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,800
Another fine, medium presentation.

1050
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,800
Stick it in your ear.
