Fantastic. It's Adam Curry.

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,960

$16 million worth of airplane strapped by us.

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,080
around y'all a seam go because he's headed to the coastline.

37
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,640
He's got born and arrived, painted on his tank,

38
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,520
brought a little bit of a lads, you can't think when he passed you by,

39
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,960
he'd give you one, because he's headed for the sunshine.

40
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,960
And you can bet on there,

41
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,360
don't get no better than that,

42
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,520
running three and living in the USA.

43
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,360
I can guarantee you that it's so fast,

44
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,680
sometimes you've got to get up and just get away.

45
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,360
You can bet on there,

46
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,840
don't get no better than that,

47
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,600
you're in the frame of mind,

48
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,760
let's have a good time,

49
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,760
can't you feel yourself out and leave your kids behind,

50
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,760
moving this at your back,

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,080
yeah girl, you're right on track,

52
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,760
you can bet on there,

53
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,400
don't get no better than that.

54
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:45,320
And you can bet on there,

55
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,560
don't get no better than that,

56
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,800
running three and living in the USA.

57
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,560
I can guarantee you that it's so fast,

58
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,880
sometimes you've got to get up and just get away.

59
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,640
You can bet on there,

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,040
don't get no better than that,

61
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,720
you can bet on there,

62
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,120
don't get no better than that,

63
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,800
you can bet on there,

64
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,840
I've set it before I'll say it again,

65
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,920
you just don't hear enough country and western

66
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,520
shit-kick-room music on the radio anymore, now do you?

67
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,320
Happy to provide it to you here on the Charlie,

68
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,960
James Taylor Curtis, don't get no better than that,

69
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,800
from the pot-same music network you can find

70
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,720
and that pot to their cons slash music

71
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,400
and of course direct link in the show notes

72
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,320
at resourcecode.com.

73
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,000
It's Wednesday, everybody, the 19th of March, 2008,

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,440
and coming to you once again from the Curry Manor,

75
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,080
it's a great day outside, it's an early show for me,

76
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,000
it's a pre-nune recording,

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,920
which is a pretty spectacular,

78
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,000
actually, it doesn't happen very often these days.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,960
Although, I must say, I was a week at five o'clock this morning,

80
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,680
a poor lady Patricia was coughing,

81
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,760
you know, a real coughing fit.

82
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,200
He was quiet through most of the night,

83
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,560
we went to bed really early,

84
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,760
which is partly why I got up at five once I was awake.

85
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,240
I think we were in bed at like 10, 30,

86
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,400
she was a wrecked man, so you got penicillin now,

87
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,000
because you can't get pneumonia, it's not not good.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,120
So she'll be okay, but it did get me a pretty early,

89
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,080
so I plenty of time to prep the show before recording,

90
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,600
and I got a pretty busy afternoon.

91
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,160
I just a little knackered, a little bit tired from the weird hours,

92
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,320
but it doesn't matter because I got a full blown show

93
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,880
for you, a couple of more cool tunes coming up for you,

94
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,560
a couple articles I want to discuss,

95
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,800
and also some of my friends checking in.

96
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,640
I've not heard from Dr. O in a long time.

97
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,920
Good old Dr. O, beautiful, beautiful, young,

98
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,120
Londoner, calling in just to check in and tell us

99
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,280
how she's doing, happy to listen to it.

100
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,880
Hey, Adam, it's Dr. O's here, just calling in.

101
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,200
What did you say?

102
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,520
My cold tooth and morning on my way to work.

103
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,080
Just so I got checked in and say hello.

104
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,560
I've been alive, I've been here.

105
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,960
I've been listening, I've been reading this.

106
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,960
I should get a phone.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,240
In how you and that out a lot on season next.com,

108
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,040
then if you're going to go yet, it's very fun.

109
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,600
Now, I hear a lot of people about season make,

110
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,200
and I think I've checked it out once or twice,

111
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,920
but unlike other flash video sites for some reason,

112
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,760
must be the routing or something weird.

113
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,480
It takes a long time to buffer and sometimes it stutters,

114
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,480
and I kind of ruins the experience.

115
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,160
And I don't know, I just haven't gotten quite into it.

116
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,440
I'm a little bit into Twitter.

117
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,520
I use it as kind of a notification system,

118
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,760
and that does seem to work fairly well.

119
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
But season making, I don't know,

120
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,240
you know what, I really don't want you to see me this way.

121
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,080
I need some kind of facade.

122
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,360
I want you, that's why you see that album art of me,

123
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,480
looking like the pod father.

124
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,480
I don't actually want you to see what I look like

125
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,680
without hair and makeup done.

126
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,640
I do, I do, I do.

127
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,760
It's exciting for Twitter.

128
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
That's a really cool people on that.

129
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,080
And they've introduced me to some new podcasts,

130
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,520
such as Mr. Mark.

131
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,240
So, the Iraqi cast, the voice, actually well.

132
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,360
You know, I know that Dr. has a really sexy voice,

133
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,880
but it just doesn't come across.

134
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,600
When she's walking down the street,

135
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,440
you know, there's too much ambient noise,

136
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,120
and I can't get into it.

137
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,520
And Dr. Dimensiony.com,

138
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,560
so I've been listening to new podcasts,

139
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,560
which also returns from South by South Wales.

140
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,680
So I think I was sitting next to the missing sound,

141
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,680
and my very first session,

142
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,680
that was then watching Mr. London do.

143
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,200
Yeah, it's good.

144
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,880
Austin was interesting,

145
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,760
and we learned anything new,

146
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,520
which is a little bit disappointing.

147
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,400
So this is to make some people including.

148
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,760
Yeah, I don't know.

149
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,120
If I'd known that you were going to be there,

150
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,040
Dr. I would have definitely gone to Austin

151
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,160
for South by Southwest.

152
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,040
But I didn't know it. I did I.

153
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,320
You got to call earlier, girl.

154
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,480
This is the future of the house.

155
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,920
Anyway, she's checking in.

156
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,080
She now single, those five next month,

157
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,000
they're in London,

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,800
hating it.

159
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,280
Oh.

160
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,080
No comments.

161
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,840
A ready,

162
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,960
paying for two.

163
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,000
That's another game.

164
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,280
Single, female.

165
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,720
35 next week,

166
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,600
living in London, hating it, no cats.

167
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,280
Girl, I'm taking you out on a date.

168
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,040
We got it. We got to fix your attitude.

169
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,400
I'll give you a call.

170
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,200
Hey, Parkey sent me an article from the Guardian today.

171
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,640
Now, you know, I don't read the Guardian for a number of reasons.

172
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,280
Yeah, I basically, I check out everything online,

173
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,120
and then I will read the Financial Times,

174
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,720
which also had some great articles today.

175
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,880
But there's this gentleman from the Scotland Yard.

176
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,280
He is his name is Gary Pue, I think, P U G H.

177
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,000
They're Pue.

178
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,400
And he's the new DNA spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers.

179
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,840
And he's saying that a debate is now needed on how far Britain should go

180
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,080
in identifying potential offenders,

181
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,520
given that some experts believe it is possible

182
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,960
to identify future offending traits in children

183
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,440
as young as five years old.

184
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,200
I love this.

185
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,200
Okay, continues.

186
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,600
If we have a primary means of identifying people

187
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,640
before they offend, then in the long term,

188
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,360
the benefits of targeting younger people are extremely

189
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,920
Yard, large said Pue.

190
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,120
You could argue the younger the better.

191
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,760
Criminologists say some people will grow out of crime, others won't.

192
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,680
We have to find who are possibly going to be the biggest threat to society.

193
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,360
And kill them.

194
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,600
He doesn't say that, but you might as well think it.

195
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,680
Kill them, incarcerate them.

196
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,480
You have bad DNA, you five-year-old child.

197
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,960
Geez, Louise, what is going on with this, huh?

198
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,160
That's like, that's like out of control.

199
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,920
A recent report from the Think Tank Institute

200
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,520
for Public Policy Research,

201
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,440
but I don't know as the IPPR,

202
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,280
called for children to be targeted between the ages of five and 12

203
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,280
with cognitive behavioral therapy, parenting programs,

204
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,640
and intensive support.

205
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,200
Prevention starts, young, it's said,

206
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,800
because prolific offenders typically

207
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,280
began offending between the ages of 10 and 13.

208
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,840
Do you realize that this is 1984?

209
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,520
This is, you know, this is thought crimes.

210
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,560
This is, so really, so now we can tell through DNA

211
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,840
that you're a bad person.

212
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,240
Well, I'm not giving any swab near my cheek bone.

213
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,200
I'll tell you that.

214
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,480
They'll block me up.

215
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,880
Does it hopefully you guys see how wrong this is?

216
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,640
This is, now this is just a discussion in the calling for debate,

217
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,480
and I'm sure that this will go nowhere,

218
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,480
but just the fact that it's out there and actually being suggested

219
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,120
to me is just totally outrageous.

220
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,760
Hey Adam, Jack, the podcast,

221
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,880
they're formally known as Jack.

222
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,760
It's interesting to talk about this three strikes in your outlock,

223
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,640
because I actually did it.

224
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,880
Yeah, this is, this is more about the UK.

225
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,960
This is the, the ISPs, the government said,

226
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,600
you know, we think that you guys should be tracking what's going on

227
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,080
with people's internet traffic,

228
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,040
and which is set up a three strikes your out system.

229
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,480
So if you're downloading a legal content of any form,

230
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,040
then you'll get a warning, then you get, uh,

231
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,840
your, um, your service will be canceled and finally terminated.

232
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,040
And I guess they come down and take a DNA sample of you and kill you.

233
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,080
Kill you for your DNA.

234
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,160
So this is not new.

235
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,840
It's happening in the States as well.

236
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,280
That's what the podcast,

237
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,560
or formally known as Jack is calling,

238
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,680
it's about calling about.

239
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,760
It's show about that last year,

240
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,320
show no longer available, sorry.

241
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,360
But, um, yeah, when I was living in Virginia,

242
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,400
my friend, uh, who's on Comcast was downloading some sopranos episodes.

243
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,760
And, uh, the interesting part of this, which your other color mentioned,

244
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,720
is that he left the torrent running all night,

245
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,800
and my friend also left his torrent running all night.

246
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,160
And in the morning, his internet service was cut off by Comcast,

247
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,560
and they told him, you get three strikes.

248
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,200
So that was strike one for downloading, uh,

249
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,400
protected or copyrighted content.

250
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,440
And, uh, if he did it again, I had been doing it some myself,

251
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,480
but I noticed, you know, when I downloaded one, I'd wait until I got my torrent

252
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,200
complete, until it shared back one time,

253
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
which is good for the health of the torrent network.

254
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,240
And then I would shut it down, leaving it open all night,

255
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,720
leaves you open to detection because you're basically serving the thing back up,

256
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,480
to others at that point.

257
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,240
And I think that's what triggers, uh, uh, the ISPs to notice what's going on.

258
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,000
So anyway, uh, I love your great hair,

259
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,080
I hope you're going to bother me, uh, see you.

260
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,280
Hey man, I love those pipes.

261
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,480
You should call it more often.

262
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,080
I'll, uh, I'll crown you a savant.

263
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,080
Yeah, so I, so there's a lot happening with this.

264
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,000
There's a lot happening at the ISP level.

265
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,520
And remember that, you know, the ISPs, uh,

266
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,040
traditionally are just meant to pass on traffic and not do anything else.

267
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,240
And I believe that this is prop, this, um,

268
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,760
the ISP has to be involved somehow some way, uh,

269
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,760
because apparently there's now companies out there,

270
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,280
judices who, um, yeah, it's pretty easy to find out where you're downloading a torrent

271
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,880
from if someone else is uploading it.

272
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,320
You know, that's pretty trackable.

273
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,560
There are ways to block that as well, but it is trackable.

274
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,120
So they must be going to the ISPs and saying,

275
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,960
hey, um, I'm from the ESA or whatever alliance.

276
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,160
And we've noticed that illegal content is being downloaded through this IP address.

277
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,280
You got to turn it off.

278
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,800
That's actually pretty simple to do.

279
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,080
I have, um, uh, I've emailed, uh,

280
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,560
ISPs about, uh, abuse, usually there's an, uh,

281
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,080
there's an email alias abuse at fill in the name of your ISP.

282
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,520
Whatever, uh, people spamming me, uh, although that doesn't really make too much

283
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,760
difference these days because of Gmail.

284
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,720
You just kind of set it in a rule and send it all to the bit bucket.

285
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,080
Doesn't really tie anything up.

286
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,120
Just can be annoying, uh, but that's pretty easy because ISPs will always air on, uh,

287
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,800
on the side of safety for themselves and, uh,

288
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,640
shut it off and ask questions later.

289
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,080
Um, there's something else that's going on with the company called, uh,

290
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,120
form phormform.com.

291
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,280
And actually, I'm not going to talk about it on the daily source code.

292
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,000
I want to talk to the, the agency to work about that.

293
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,480
So we'll do that on Friday, but there's clearly a lot of stuff going on.

294
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,760
People are monitoring everything and I think that what people, you know,

295
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,320
companies, governments.

296
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,440
And I think we're just now kind of starting to figure it out and notice it.

297
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,440
Although not all believe in in the conspiracy, I certainly do.

298
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,720
Let's just come back to those millions of cameras here in the United Kingdom who

299
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,520
weren't that are watching you, watching your every moment, every move, um,

300
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,960
the oyster card, which is, um, the public transport system.

301
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,000
It's a credit card.

302
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,800
Of course, you're being tracked where you go, every tube station, every train station.

303
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,280
And still, people don't want to believe it.

304
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,440
Adam, it's a game. There's something more well.

305
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,800
And I'll know what we should be quote.

306
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,760
So I'm thanking the priest.

307
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,800
And then this is like they make a picture thing, you're not hearing anything off anybody

308
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,160
and written about flashmops or very few people.

309
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,240
But it's because nobody's interested.

310
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,720
All right.

311
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,360
So this, of course, is my call once again that I think we need to stand up and protest.

312
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,520
Oh, wait a minute, you're not allowed to protest without a license in the UK.

313
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:40,840
Hmm.

314
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,640
I'm sorry.

315
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,240
Uh, no, no one's interested.

316
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,680
Apparently, and James says, says it, so it must be true.

317
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,440
Because people don't realize they're not being watched.

318
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,080
Like this plan from 50,000 feet to the folks at watching from 50,000 feet.

319
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,880
It's huge.

320
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,080
Dude, have you ever looked at Google Earth?

321
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,560
That's from a satellite.

322
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,720
That's much higher than 50,000 feet.

323
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
I can zoom all the way down into my backyard.

324
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,680
How about you?

325
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,400
Of course, they're watching you, not James.

326
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,840
Just a big experiment.

327
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,800
As far as I'm concerned, I'm thinking about our license, big experiments, change this interest

328
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,320
great, see what happens.

329
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,120
I give out this type of rubbish, see what happens.

330
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,160
Somebody higher up, not a government, but somebody higher up is just playing games and singing

331
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,400
how things change when we do, if you want, and search the different people, it's simple as that.

332
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
You're not being watching it, you know, pretty much.

333
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,160
Yeah, I am being watched, and I do agree with you there, James.

334
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,240
Yes, of course it's being done by people higher up.

335
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,440
It's called the banks, the richest people in the world.

336
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,000
I mean, look at the Federal Reserve.

337
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,320
Again, a commercial organization, a secretive commercial organization,

338
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,120
because they do not publish numbers.

339
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,720
They do not publish their members list, which of course is all banks.

340
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,720
And over the weekend, when the markets were closed, they just decided to print up some greenbacks.

341
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:08,680
What they didn't consult me is just devalued the dollar and handed over 30 billion to bear

342
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,840
Oh, it's horrible, dude.

343
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,000
And it's not just here, it's everywhere.

344
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,200
Yes, you're absolutely right.

345
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,880
By the way, the big distraction is of course the Clinton Obama battle that's going on right now.

346
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,160
You know, keep talking about that.

347
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Well, all this other shit happens in the background.

348
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,880
I mean, it's a perfect, perfect opportunity for the people that truly run the world,

349
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,840
which is the banks.

350
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,280
And in this case, the richest families in the world who owned the banks,

351
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,040
were founded the banks, you know, their shareholders, their majority shareholders,

352
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,040
and the Federal Reserve and other central banks.

353
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,160
But the Federal Reserve is without a doubt doing nasty stuff.

354
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,840
Right now, in fact, I'm not a financial expert, but this was actually sent to me.

355
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,720
Let me see, I have a comment on this that was pretty good.

356
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,320
John Kits, he sends me a lot of stuff.

357
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,400
He said that given the U.S. inflation is hitting 4%,

358
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,320
and the Fed is now, of course, cut its rate again,

359
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,640
which is nearing 2%, the interest rates.

360
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,200
In fact, they're giving the money away.

361
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,600
They're giving the money away, okay?

362
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,720
It's free money.

363
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,520
Free money for the banks. By the way, I checked in my mail.

364
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,520
I didn't see any free money offered to me.

365
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,160
Now, of course, not. It's only the richest people in the world.

366
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,080
In a contrary to popular belief, I'm not a part of that club.

367
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,040
Come on, anybody, what you got for us today?

368
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,400
I did Mr. prolific program. I have from San Francisco.

369
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,560
I had some thoughts regarding your willingness to do a flash mob in the UK.

370
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,280
And to get the word out, there's a gentleman that has summoned them,

371
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,120
and realized that he's probably not the most popular MP,

372
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:07,480
but he seems to be very much into this kind of protests and the rest of it.

373
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,720
Give me reached out to comments or at GeorgeGalloway.com.

374
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,760
We might want to reach him.

375
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,520
Contact me with more information.

376
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,280
Is that plug-done prolific program?com?

377
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:27,640
This PRO, L-I-F-I-C-P-R-O-G-R-A-M-M-E-R.com.

378
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,560
Slime the ratios.

379
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,440
Prolific program, thank you very much, my friend.

380
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,800
Yeah. I'd love to start a flash mob, or at least be involved in it,

381
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,560
but the British people have got to stand up.

382
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,080
I'm not going to do all this by myself.

383
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,320
I know, I've seen Galloway. He was on big brother,

384
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,880
and although I like him, I've never met him, but he seems like a pretty cool guy.

385
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,240
He has no credibility. Everyone here thinks he's a cook.

386
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,960
But of course, everyone thought Ron Paul was a cook, and you'll see.

387
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,280
You'll see. The first thing Ron Paul said was get rid of the federal reserve,

388
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,360
and right now they're bankrupting our country.

389
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,200
The United States that is.

390
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,680
And the same thing's happening over here. It's going to happen everywhere.

391
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,360
So, yeah, I'd love to, man. I'd love to get the flash mob going,

392
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,600
but I don't think we need politicians in this game.

393
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,280
We need to show the power of the people.

394
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,920
In fact, going back to that DNA story here's a thought.

395
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,240
Sure, you can take DNA from my daughter, okay?

396
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,920
And to see if she's going to be a criminal,

397
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,320
but we start with all members of Parliament first,

398
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,800
because if you have the wrong DNA,

399
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,560
we'll have to kill you!

400
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,240
The B&B is Pongosterior on a solar-systemation,

401
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,520
featuring the best of all genres of the electronic music.

402
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,880
This is BZUKJO, and this week on solar-systemation,

403
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,400
which, by Legendary Nietzsche,

404
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,160
a tune recording artist, Aman Tobin,

405
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,360
or a retrospective mix of his career so far.

406
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,640
I think the way it affected me personally,

407
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,160
is in that means my thing is that I never had to drive it forward.

408
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,920
You know, it's unfamiliar territory,

409
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,960
and I think that's really good things in general.

410
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,600
It's a good place to be, I think, out of your depth.

411
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,160
If you're trying to discover things.

412
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,880
Listen to the best of all genres of electronic music,

413
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,200
each week on solar-systemation.

414
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,360
If so, we'll all be in a fire stairs,

415
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,960
and see you next time, don't cough.

416
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:32,440
It's a guy in town, thinks that I'm a little crazy.

417
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,640
Uh-huh, he's a sweet talking guy.

418
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,080
He's gonna talk his way into my life.

419
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,200
No matter who you are,

420
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,760
no don't hesitate,

421
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,160
because I got to know before I rest with him.

422
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,000
If we're gonna decide, we're gonna play.

423
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,640
If we're gonna pull us,

424
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,880
smile on your face,

425
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,040
whenever you call me,

426
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,440
I'll be around you,

427
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,000
if you're feeling better.

428
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,440
If you wanna be my friend,

429
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,880
you can get a little closer.

430
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,480
If you wanna get high,

431
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,600
better, rather, rather close up.

432
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,160
Oh, how long don't feel satisfied,

433
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,520
shine, don't hesitate,

434
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,000
because I need to know before I sleep.

435
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,760
If you're gonna decide,

436
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,520
we're gonna play.

437
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,320
If we're gonna pull us,

438
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,400
smile on your face,

439
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,560
whenever you call me,

440
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,120
I'll be around you,

441
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,600
if you're feeling better.

442
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,720
Oh, how long don't feel satisfied,

443
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,880
now it's forever.

444
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,880
I'll be around you,

445
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,360
now it's forever.

446
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Oh, how long don't feel satisfied,

447
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,960
now it's forever.

448
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,960
If you're gonna decide,

449
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,120
we're gonna play.

450
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,040
If we're gonna pull us,

451
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,280
smile on your face,

452
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,440
whenever you call me,

453
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,840
I'll be around you,

454
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,280
if you're feeling better.

455
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,240
If you wanna be my friend,

456
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,640
smile on your face,

457
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,720
if we're gonna pull us,

458
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,640
smile on your face,

459
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,880
whenever you call me,

460
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,120
I'll be around you,

461
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,240
you know,

462
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,840
has really nothing wrong with a good

463
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,520
pop tune on the Charlie once in a while,

464
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,480
I hate it.

465
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,600
Creamy.dk,

466
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,480
we got the time,

467
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,160
they're from the pod save music network,

468
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,080
I kind of liked it,

469
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,840
you know, it was one of those real FM

470
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,920
top 40 poppy hits,

471
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,600
I like it.

472
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,800
No talent required,

473
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,840
they may be very talented,

474
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,320
I don't know,

475
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,760
but a lot of voice pressing,

476
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,960
processing, going up.

477
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,480
Oh, whatever,

478
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,640
link to that song on the on the pod save music network,

479
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,280
in the show notes,

480
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,520
of course,

481
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,040
the dailysourcecode.com.

482
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,080
For God's tell you over the weekend,

483
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,920
I had a chat with a reporter from Billboard

484
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,600
magazine at Amazon TV,

485
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,280
and I knew that she was out doing the rounds,

486
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,800
because I got a couple notes,

487
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,360
see from Jersey Todd,

488
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,880
and a couple other folks,

489
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,400
as she asked them,

490
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,760
you know, she was asking for interviews

491
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,920
and questions about pod save music.

492
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,560
And so I spoke to her finally over the weekend,

493
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,920
and nice, you know,

494
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,520
she lives in New York,

495
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,400
works for Billboard,

496
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,960
I think she's younger than I am,

497
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,600
I'm not quite sure,

498
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,000
you know,

499
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,520
sounds like she's in her late 20s.

500
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:39,880
And I said,

501
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,080
you know, I've been waiting three years

502
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,200
for this interview to happen,

503
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,320
I really have a really,

504
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,840
what does all that smoke outside?

505
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,680
Wow, hold on.

506
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,560
Is that coming from us?

507
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,960
Something's burning in the backyard.

508
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:53,880
Oh well.

509
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,360
I said, I've been waiting three years

510
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,320
for this interview, Evie,

511
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,640
to talk to you about how important

512
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,200
the concept of pod save music is.

513
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,840
And there's other places where you can

514
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,080
get music to play with permission,

515
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,360
without having to pay for it,

516
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,440
purely for the promotional aspect of the artist.

517
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,520
And I'm really hoping that

518
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,560
that she recorded the interview,

519
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,200
which is good,

520
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,040
because then you,

521
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,040
wow, it's starting to stink up the attic here.

522
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,160
I should close the window.

523
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,040
That one's really,

524
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,400
something really bad is burning.

525
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,800
I got, I got a,

526
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,640
I got a three alarm fire out there.

527
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,280
Anyways, I'll keep you up to speed on that.

528
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,800
I think she was showing it to her,

529
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,080
to her editor today or tomorrow.

530
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,000
So hopefully that'll come up pretty quick.

531
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,880
It'll be interesting to see.

532
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,440
And I really did say a couple of things there

533
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,880
that if she prints it,

534
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,880
should get some attention from some people

535
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,680
in the industry.

536
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,800
I'm just going back just thinking about that.

537
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,400
That DNA stuff,

538
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,160
that's really bothering me,

539
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,800
particularly because it's coming from a think tank.

540
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,000
Think tanks also, by the way,

541
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,200
rule out the world,

542
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,120
think tanks come up with the strategy

543
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,480
and pass those on to politicians,

544
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,640
but it's bothersome.

545
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,920
You know, let's take some DNA,

546
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,200
see if your kid is fucked up.

547
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,480
Well, you know what,

548
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,320
why should you just do an amniocentesis,

549
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:05,720
you know?

550
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,920
And if the child has the bad DNA,

551
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,440
just rip it right out of the woman,

552
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:12,920
kill it!

553
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,680
Ah, remember people,

554
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,080
the government works for you and for me,

555
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,080
this is wrong.

556
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,760
Comic strip,

557
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Comic strip,

558
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,960
Comic strip,

559
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,560
Comic strip,

560
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,600
Comic strip,

561
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,120
Comic strip,

562
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,080
Comic strip,

563
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,480
Comic strip,

564
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,000
of course I didn't mean the comic strip

565
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,120
blogger is wrong.

566
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,120
I just meant that whole DNA thing is wrong.

567
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,040
Here's our friend, our EU correspondent

568
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,160
with the latest report.

569
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,360
Welcome, Adam, my pal, Kerry.

570
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,000
Do you know why GSM has become the most popular

571
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,400
standard of mobile telephony on this planet?

572
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,200
Please tell me.

573
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,160
It was because EU countries made it a compulsory standard in EU.

574
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,440
So do you know what is DVBH?

575
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,640
It is digital video broadcasting handheld.

576
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,880
And EU has just decided that it will be

577
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,520
standard for mobile television in all EU countries.

578
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,920
So next time you buy your mobile phone,

579
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,800
please feel free to demand DVBH as one of its features.

580
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,880
Okay, yeah, DVBH digital video broadcast handheld.

581
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,720
Ah, it's interesting.

582
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,760
Well, if the European Union sets it as a standard,

583
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,080
it has a good shot of becoming the standard you're right.

584
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,600
I'm pretty sure that's exactly what happened with the GSM protocol.

585
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,040
And still the state's not, I think sprint still is on a different type of system.

586
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,320
I like the GSM standard quite a bit actually.

587
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,920
You know, it's funny because last night,

588
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,160
I came back from the, from the office.

589
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,720
Now what I do is I take the train in on the mornings,

590
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,720
but in the evening it's such a hassle to get from the east side

591
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,360
where in shortage, where our office is to the west side,

592
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,880
where Waterloo Station is that I just take a car all the way home.

593
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,520
I mean, that last bit, once you, once you're, oh man,

594
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,040
I never should have recorded that shit with Patricia.

595
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,480
Now my system is messed up.

596
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,360
Anyway, once you're past the west side,

597
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,160
you know, then it's pretty much like 20 minutes and I'm home, right?

598
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,280
But it's all that piece in the middle.

599
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,800
So I'll take a car service all the way.

600
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,600
And, you know, it's, you know, just have a regular car service.

601
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,040
But I got lucky and it turns out I got lucky because the guy

602
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,760
who drove me a driven me before when I had got lucky previously.

603
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,360
The lucky part is instead of a quote regular sedan,

604
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,720
he shows up with a Mercedes S series.

605
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,440
I don't know, 500, 600, 8,000, whatever it is.

606
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
And S series, beautiful.

607
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,120
I mean, you can adjust the back seat.

608
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,920
It's got heating.

609
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,920
For the same price, by the way, is as the regular quote regular sedan.

610
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,680
And the reason why is because when these guys come on,

611
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,400
foreign, or between four and seven and like four in the afternoon,

612
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,680
they can actually look at the list of jobs that are coming up.

613
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,960
And so they know that Gilford is a nice trip.

614
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,480
And so they'll kind of be handy if they can.

615
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,080
They'll hang around in my general area.

616
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,600
Then the computer says, oh, wait a minute.

617
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,040
Because of course, those guys are tracked.

618
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,080
Hey, they should take their DNA and kill them.

619
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,840
And so then they automatically get the job.

620
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,760
So this guy, you know, he was hanging around

621
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,320
and I got in the car like, oh, nice.

622
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,320
Because they have, in addition to all these wonderful seating features,

623
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,120
they have television built into the headrest of the front seats.

624
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,600
So you can sit in the back and you can watch TV.

625
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,280
Now, I've been taking limos and different forms of upper-scale

626
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,960
transportation since I was, I don't know, 19.

627
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,200
And particularly in the States, in and in New York,

628
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,720
you know, lots of limos, and they always have a TV in there.

629
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,400
You know, and it's pretty useless.

630
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,920
It's always been completely, you know,

631
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,240
they've got the boomerang antenna on the back,

632
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,640
which although looks very cool, it's just useless,

633
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,080
particularly in the city because, you know,

634
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,400
you only get VHS for UHF stations.

635
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,080
It fades in and out.

636
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,920
So usually it used to be used for VHS cassettes or DVDs.

637
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,920
But, you know, I don't want to watch a DVD.

638
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,600
And, you know, I'm bored.

639
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,520
Show me something, you know, like news or whatever.

640
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,320
And that's interesting.

641
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,920
It's the same as jet blue.

642
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,680
You know, it's not really comfortable.

643
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,640
It's not a lot of service, but you got your direct TVs.

644
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,720
So you're not bored, and you got something to do,

645
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,920
and it passes the time.

646
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,440
It really works.

647
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,360
Live TV broadcast, fantastic.

648
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,640
Now, what they have in the UK is something called free view.

649
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,880
This is a brilliant system.

650
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,640
This is really, really smart.

651
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,480
So I don't know how long ago this started many years ago, apparently.

652
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,760
The analog system, the analog broadcast towers,

653
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,400
also transmit a digital signal that can be received

654
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,400
with a non-subscription-based cheap jack set top box.

655
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,280
So you can buy them for like 50 bucks these days.

656
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,280
You know, a lot of TVs come with it built in.

657
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,840
It's all built into the box.

658
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,360
And it gives you digital television.

659
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,640
And I think you get like 25 channels.

660
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,560
All the important ones you want to have,

661
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,880
and then you can subscribe to other ones.

662
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,800
So even though it's a non-subscription-based

663
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
is for your basic package, you just buy it.

664
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,320
No one knows who you are.

665
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,960
If you want to get more, I think they'll have some softcore porn

666
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,080
and stuff so you can order that.

667
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,280
And it's been, it's a revolution.

668
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,440
It's the biggest system in the UK.

669
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,120
I think there's, I'm going out on a limb here.

670
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,520
But I believe that there's 15 million of these boxes

671
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,160
that are being used.

672
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,920
Maybe even more than that.

673
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,320
So you sit in the car and for the first time ever,

674
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,200
because it's digital, there's no static.

675
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,520
Yeah, cut out, maybe four times.

676
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,400
It just kind of faded it in and out real quick or cut out.

677
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,440
But it automatically mutes, so you don't get horrible sound.

678
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,120
But everywhere else, we were driving a work

679
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,840
and it was a great experience.

680
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,280
So I'm thinking, I wonder, is that the same stands?

681
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,280
Well, I guess, so that is DVB digital video broadcast.

682
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,760
I wonder if the handheld is the same protocol

683
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,560
if we can get free view on our handsets.

684
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,440
I believe in that.

685
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,600
For faux show, I believe in that.

686
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,200
That could be pretty awesome.

687
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,680
Thank you very much.

688
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,880
Come extra blogger.

689
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,520
One of the many savants on a daily source code.

690
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,160
Here's an interesting question that popped up that I will get an answer to.

691
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,640
Hey Adam, I have a 2020 question for you.

692
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,320
When you're living in the cottage,

693
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,240
Patricia was always complaining about the headaches

694
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,760
or pains, body aches, because you guys thought it was related

695
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,600
to the cell towers.

696
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,000
And you guys moved, got a new place.

697
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,680
And you mentioned that we didn't hear anything else from that.

698
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,120
Was it if they continued or what was going on?

699
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,800
Now that you found out about the appendix,

700
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,000
is do you think all of that was related to the appendix

701
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,040
or to the cell sites?

702
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,760
Yeah, good question.

703
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,600
And I will ask the lady piece.

704
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,960
You'll come on the show.

705
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,560
Maybe for Friday, I'll certainly get her in,

706
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,760
I hope to get her in next week.

707
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,120
She may be going away next week.

708
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,280
I don't know, she's really busy with that got talent show.

709
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,000
But I just, you know, went back into the history myself.

710
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,720
No, I mean, the whole thing with the appendix

711
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,520
that started a year ago in January.

712
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,800
And we had already moved or just on the cusp of moving out

713
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,160
of the cottage to the manner.

714
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,760
But I have to say, I have not heard any more complaints

715
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,720
from her about that.

716
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,120
So I think the appendix thing happened when she was doing dancing

717
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,120
with the stars, so that was a year ago.

718
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,760
But this all predates that a year and a half to two years

719
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,800
before that she was complaining about what she thought was the cell tower.

720
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,360
And I have to say, I haven't heard a word about it.

721
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,680
So I will ask her, but I have the feeling

722
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,400
that it's that her issues are gone in that respect.

723
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,640
And I don't think it has anything to do with the appendix.

724
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,440
Because she didn't have it at all.

725
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,520
As far as I know, for the year that we've been living here,

726
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,240
I will find out though for sure.

727
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,720
And I really want to get her on.

728
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,200
But this got talent show.

729
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,120
She's making a ton of money with this by the way.

730
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,400
Like, out the added another date for this for that.

731
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,080
And you know my wife, she didn't do anything if it didn't for money.

732
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,040
I love her that way.

733
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,240
So I think she's going to be buying our daughter a new car once she turns 18.

734
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,280
Or actually, when she turns 18, she's taking her driving test

735
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,600
and I think two or three months.

736
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,280
Worst fear for a parent ever, eh?

737
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,240
So Adam, Jason from San Diego.

738
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:40,760
What if I wanted a full-time job in a team mainstream TV?

739
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,920
What would I need to do?

740
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,480
What is it that I'd have to give up?

741
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,560
Just curious.

742
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,560
Okay, you're referring to the pilot that I was offered,

743
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,880
which I will do, by the way, the game show.

744
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,280
What do you have to do?

745
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,600
Well, in order to be in mainstream media, of course,

746
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,280
you have to give up all your morals.

747
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,720
You have to give up your soul.

748
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,240
Um, you know, my first born is already safe.

749
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,200
So I guess if I had another kid, I'd probably have to give that up as well.

750
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,480
But I think really the morals, you know, you can give all that up in all control.

751
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,800
It's a fun show, though.

752
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,600
I think it'll be cool.

753
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,800
We'll see what happens with it.

754
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,800
Okay, let me see how long we do in this now.

755
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,520
It's how, yeah, I didn't make just have a short show for you guys today.

756
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,560
I don't want to overdo it.

757
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,440
Yeah, 34 minutes.

758
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,600
You know, let's play one more song and I'll get out of your way.

759
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,400
This is a song that I found over at mashuptown.com.

760
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,200
And I thought it was just such a great song for kind of a,

761
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,240
well, it would have been better for a Sunday morning or Sunday afternoon.

762
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,040
But when they'll work as well,

763
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,600
Fuego, he's matched up beautiful, easy girls.

764
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,440
I know you're gonna love it right here on the Wednesday, Charlie.

765
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,560
You're happy, so excited.

766
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,440
It's always side of what you say.

767
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:10,600
Over, down my own knees, beautiful girls.

768
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,160
They only want to do you dirt.

769
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,280
They'll have you, so excited.

770
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,280
So excited when they say it's over.

771
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,000
See, it's hurting that no part used to chill after dark.

772
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,840
Oh, and it took my heart.

773
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,720
That's when we fell apart, because we both thought that love,

774
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,960
last forever, last forever.

775
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,560
They say we're too young to get ourselves strong.

776
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,400
Oh, we didn't care.

777
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:47,960
We made it very clearly our souls said that we couldn't last together.

778
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,240
Let's together, let's together.

779
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,240
Shaky, shaky, shaky.

780
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,960
Go away to beautiful girls.

781
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,440
That's why you don't have a word.

782
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,640
You're happy, so excited.

783
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:12,440
So excited when you say it's over, down my own knees, beautiful girls.

784
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,000
They only want to do you dirt.

785
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,040
They'll have you, so excited.

786
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,160
So excited when they say it's over.

787
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,760
It was back in 99, watching movies all the time.

788
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,360
Oh, and now we're in the way for doing my first cry.

789
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:36,760
And I never thought that we was gonna see each other, each other.

790
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,560
And then I came out, my people fell down so full.

791
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,760
I went my girl, who I thought was my word.

792
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,160
It came out to me that she wasn't the girl for me.

793
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:55,160
It came out for me, it came out for me.

794
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:28,520
You're away to beautiful girls.

795
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,000
That's why you don't have a word.

796
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,960
You're happy, so excited.

797
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:42,920
So excited when you say it's over, down my own knees, beautiful girls.

798
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,400
They only want to do you dirt.

799
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:57,240
They'll have you, so excited when you say it's over, down my own knees, beautiful girls.

800
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,640
That's why you don't have a word.

801
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:11,480
You're happy, so excited when you say it's over, down my own knees, beautiful girls.

802
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,040
They only want to do you dirt.

803
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:25,720
They'll have you, so excited when you say it's over, down my own knees, beautiful girls.

804
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,200
That's why you don't have a word.

805
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:37,960
You're happy, so excited, so excited when you say it's over, down my own knees, beautiful girls.

806
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:44,360
What a perfect match, Sean Kingston, beautiful girl, and Carmino's, of course,

807
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,240
easy like a Sunday morning, matched up.

808
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,000
They just sound fantastic together.

809
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,680
Love that.

810
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:55,960
All right, body, let me see, I think we'll do another show tomorrow, Friday.

811
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,120
It'll be a four-day Charlie week, close, close, close, close.

812
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,920
All right, everybody, thank you so much for listening.
