1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Shara Charley, 7-4-2.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
With $16 billion worth of airplane strapped to my ass,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
then the next generation radio contenting my ears.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We don't need not seeking forgiveness.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I like to think I'm flying to the future.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I guess it's a happy curry.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Come on, they're more on its brand new day.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000

Come on, they're more on its brand new day.

Come on, they're more on its brand new day.

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Come on, they're more on its brand new day.

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Come on, they're more on its brand new day.

Come on, they're more on its brand new day.

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Come on, they're more on its brand new day.

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,500
Come on, they're

69
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,000
Come on, they're more on its brand new day.

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Come on, they're more on its brand new day.

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I really needed to play something that reminded me that I'm free.

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Good morning freedom.

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And good morning.

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Good afternoon.

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Good evening.

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hello.

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Good day to you tomorrow.

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Daily source code episode number 742.

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey.

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In a cloudy and an overcast killed for it.

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
West Side of Gtown.

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Wow.

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I've always missed that part on that record.

84
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hey, everybody.

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
How are you doing?

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Folks listening to the podcast version of the Daily source code.

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Those of you checking us out live on live 365.

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Having its usual problems.

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
People not being able to connect.

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Kind of pisses me off because I went for the 99 dollar a month option.

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I actually paid a year in advance.

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Could I figure, you know, well, it's a little bit cheaper.

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why not?

94
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I've used them before.

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But I've never seen these problems with these guys.

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Last time I used their service was pool.

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't know.

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Maybe a year and a half or two years ago.

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So they're with me hanging there.

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We're doing the best that we can.

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I feel kind of anxious today.

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And, you know, woke up and I don't know.

103
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm just feeling restless really.

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's an unrest throughout my entire body.

105
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And I'm trying to pinpoint this.

106
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You know, I'm examining these feelings.

107
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I think what is really going on with me.

108
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And I think there's a number of things.

109
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And a lot of it is just the conversations we're having on the tanty source code.

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
A lot of this stuff was really freaking me out.

111
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I mean, not like I'm tripping.

112
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But just, you know, my mind keeps on going.

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's very, very hard to stop thinking about all these different conversations.

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And, you know, it's a fact.

115
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I feel, or at least for me, if you start to get some information overload on particular topics.

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Those of the complicated kind, or perhaps even those of the conspirator kind.

117
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Your mind starts going pretty far.

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And luckily I've been getting a lot of, you know, a lot of the contrarian views.

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And a lot of these topics we've been talking about the multicultural society.

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We've been talking about, well, that's why I played Good Morning Freedom about our own freedom.

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How free are we?

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What is the status of our freedom of speech and freedom of expression?

123
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The financial crisis.

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You know, thoughts of taking DNA from kids in a term if they're going to be troublemakers later on.

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I mean, just saw this stuff and it's very hard to weigh exactly what is happening.

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What isn't happening?

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What's true?

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What's not true?

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Where the half-throughs?

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Where the word of the half-truths intersect?

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's complicated.

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So luckily, though, today, we're going to get through a lot of this with some excellent feedback

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and some great comments and some good questions, which is really the best thing to do, I think, at this point.

134
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And it'll really come down to education, I think.

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Remember, this is a political, politically correct free zone on the daily source code.

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is where we talk about anything and everything and everything goes, no name calling alive.

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Hey, Adam, this is Jared from Washington State.

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That footballer Friday was fierce.

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Way to kick him in the teeth.

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Taking a pass on important issues because they're difficult and messy is totally chicken.

141
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That guy with the hard pronounced name from the Netherlands may be a little over the top from an American or Canadian point of view,

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
but he should say whatever he thinks is right.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's what freedom of speech is about.

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The importance of freedom of speech is why political correctness is so dangerous.

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I hate political correctness.

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It limits every discussion.

147
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The sense is conversation and it makes topics and ideas off limits.

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This is one of the problems with the public schools.

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It pre-programs kids that some thoughts are just not acceptable.

150
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That conformity is key and that is part of the reason for the lag in maturity of our own country.

151
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I want to even start an American news.

152
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I watch BBC America because they seem to have a brain in a couple of balls.

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I totally disagree with the constant demonization of the rich.

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Thank God for the well to do.

155
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You know, those guys didn't just bingo and win this money.

156
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Most of them worked very hard to get what they have.

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I don't know about everybody else.

158
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But I am not employed by the poor.

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
A rich guy who worked hard to get where he is has given me the opportunity to make a living.

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Wave that rich guy flag and tell him to shut the fuck up.

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm not rich, but I want to be.

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And so do all those antiest bastards who are giving you all this shit.

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's all I got.

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Jared from Washington State.

165
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, Jared.

166
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No kids.

167
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Got a dog.

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Go time.

169
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
See you later.

170
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I love you meeting that.

171
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah.

172
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah.

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And this is one of the things that I struggle with all the time.

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I mean obviously I was born rich.

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You know, comparatively speaking to the entire planet born very, very rich.

176
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But I've also been monetarily rich myself.

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I've been, you know, ever since I've been a millionaire since I was 23.

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So for 20 years I've been in a very small percentage of the world.

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You know, that can say that they're that wealthy.

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And of course there's many, many people much wealthier than I am.

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But it's hard, you know, it make it, how do you put things into perspective?

182
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And I think, I think that, and wow, it's already becoming hard for me to start to formulate a lot of this stuff.

183
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That we really have to caution ourselves each as an individual.

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That we're responsible for everything and anything just as much as anyone else.

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You know, at the bottom basis of it all, one human is exactly the same as the next human.

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And this is kind of my Dutch upbringing that comes out by saying that, you know, we all get out of bed.

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
One, one leg at a time.

188
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We all put on our trousers.

189
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
One leg at a time.

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Of course, I'm Bruce Dickinson. And when I do that, I make hit record.

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Sorry, little throwback to the cowbell.

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So, you know, no one's better than another person or no one's worse than another person.

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But it is our responsibility. And I think maybe that's where I want to go today.

194
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I think it's our responsibility as, a lot of us here in the chucklehead group are parents.

195
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Or in your parents to be, or it will soon be parents, or at least have some responsibility over more than just yourself.

196
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
There's someone else in your life more than likely.

197
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That could even be an aged parent for all I care.

198
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But that's pretty much just looking at the basic demographics of the show.

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's who we are.

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And I think that we're doing the world a huge disservice by, and this goes across the board.

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And of course, I'm putting hand on my heart.

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You know, I'm doing the same thing.

203
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's very easy to complain and yell at the man at the government at them.

204
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But they, we should actually, we should outlaw the word they on the show as well.

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I really despise that all my life.

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I remember them TV, Steve Leeds, my good buddy, would say, hey, you know, they really want you to cut your hair.

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So who's they? Well, you know, they up there at the office.

208
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Fuck that. They can come down here and talk to me about it.

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I never did cut my hair. By the way, I got fired seven times. They hired me back each time.

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But the responsibility is ours.

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And I think we're probably not doing a very good job with our children.

212
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And that's mainly because there's so much distraction going on in the world.

213
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We're creating a lot of it, by the way, ourselves.

214
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And we're, we're falling into a number of traps that we actually have set ourselves.

215
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And we've set ourselves up for partially through just apparently the way human humans work and the way our, what's in our DNA and what we crave and what we strive for.

216
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But we are missing a lot of the, the important things and we're certainly not questioning them.

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Enough ourselves and we're definitely not opening up dialogue with the next generation is to what this is all really about.

218
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And by the way, kids are not stupid. You know, has my daughter heard of the credit crisis?

219
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Does she know what it is? No. Does she care? No.

220
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Because it's not a topic of conversation. Well, it is actually here. But in general, that's not a topic of conversation.

221
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I was shocked yesterday. Absolutely shocked.

222
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Christina says, Dad, Dad, I finally found a great way to get songs on the internet.

223
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh, well, what is that? She says, look, it's this thing called a zurious. Oh, my God.

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:24,000
She says, yeah, I have to do was find a file that says to rent, which was kind of cute, you know, because she's never, she's clearly never had this conversation in her own community or maybe only written, but we call it a torrent. She said it to rent.

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And he can just download this music.

226
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And I said, well, dude, this is problematic. And you know, and I started the dialogue with her first all about copyright and these bands.

227
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And actually the way she founded was I had told her about the radio head album that she could download that one for free or she could contribute whatever she thought was appropriate. Of course, she downloaded it for free.

228
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And that's how she found this whole Victorian thing.

229
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And of course, now I know exactly when it's on because the home bandwidth and the entire house slows down to a crawl. She doesn't really understand what's happening.

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I did walk her through it and I told her about copyright and how, you know, her favorite bands, you know, how she's basically taking money from them.

231
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And you know, suggests that some alternative ways and easier ways to get music on to her computer.

232
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Because that's really what it is. She buys CDs quite frequently.

233
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But she finds that a pain in the ass and the ripping and she just doesn't want to do that. She just wants to have an instant gratification.

234
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And of course, I also would letter her to the fact that, you know, this is trackable and that you could wind up with no internet.

235
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
With no internet service whatsoever. But I was kind of disappointed. I was severely disappointed in myself.

236
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That here I am, a guy who knows a lot about this has grown up with this has been a part of this file sharing and the internet in general.

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And I'm just flabbergasted that my knowledge and my values towards this and I do not download songs off of the torrent.

238
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And, you know, in fact, I tried to reverse the process and I tried to give music exposures for people go out and buy it.

239
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm flabbergasted that none of that has passed down on to her. So we got to talk about education.

240
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Because, you know, let's face it. You know, I got a lot of living left to do and I'm going to enjoy myself. But I don't think I have.

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's a young man's game, you know, to go and prove stuff and change the world. I can certainly facilitate and do all I can.

242
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And I do that in many different ways.

243
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But we really have to start this educational process at home. And that goes across the board for all groups, all race, all religions, all creeds, everything.

244
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And I know I'm not alone. And this is good, man. This is really good that we're starting.

245
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
By the way, if you're listening on live 365, it's very possible that the stream is going in and out.

246
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Because I'm quite sure that my daughter is downstairs with her azureus P to P on.

247
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And I think I can even see nice cast telling me that it's messed up. So, sorry about that.

248
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But here is someone who is incredibly smart, who I've known for almost a decade actually.

249
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah, maybe even longer than a decade. But we've been good friends, certainly intensely for the past a couple of years, Andrew Grummit from Pachio.

250
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And he has some questions that just, you know, for someone who's very, very smart. I'm like, okay, wow, we read none of us really understand the basics of what's in front of us and how things work in the world.

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And I have a sneaking suspicion that this is not being taught properly in school. And if it is, it's probably only very superficial,

252
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm not going into the real meeting potatoes, which, of course, is the interesting thing about how our world runs and who does the running.

253
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Hey Adam, it's Andrew Grummit here, checking in from HQ.

254
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Actually, this time, I don't have an HQ update, but rather I wanted to check in on the money system conversation that has been taking place on your show.

255
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So, I'm not in the economist, but I've been really interested in this stuff. I think it's fascinating.

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And I'm trying to wrap my head around it. So, I wanted to pass a couple of observations by your listeners, hopefully get some stuff on level feedback.

257
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Okay, by the way, I love that. That's right, calling out on the savants. Hey, I wonder if nylon's okay in the middle of all of this.

258
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Excuse me, you are a New York financial guru, savante in London, the nylon.

259
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I hope he's still got a gig, you know, we don't know exactly what he does, but I think he's in the financial sector.

260
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes, indeed. We need some savants on this. Bring it on.

261
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The first one, the gold standard, right, this is part of Ron Paul's platform. Something you've mentioned before.

262
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And there's something about it. I can't quite get my head around. So here it is. It's a thought experiment.

263
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We know that there's only so much gold in the earth, right? There's only so much gold you can dig up.

264
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So let's imagine a world where we have 100 people and 100 gold pieces, right?

265
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So basically, let's say we start off with each of those 100 people having one gold piece.

266
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Okay, now, you know, some time goes by, people have kids and the population doubles.

267
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So now there are 200 people and only 100 gold pieces. How do we, you know, how do we handle that?

268
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Does each person on average, now maybe has, you know, half a gold piece.

269
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And effectively, if we use the, you know, the weight of the gold as a measure of currency, suddenly, there's, you know, more people, but just the same amount of money.

270
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So how does it work, right? Because generally speaking, prices go up.

271
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:10,000
People's incomes go up for better or worse. You know, there's this feeling of progress as time goes on and people's wealth gets larger.

272
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Hopefully. So I don't, it seems contrary to that trend that you would have a fixed amount of money and that generally speaking on average,

273
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
people would have less money with each successive generation.

274
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So I, I just don't know how, how do you apply that thinking to a world where there's increasing population and, you know, maybe we're nowhere near it, but a finite amount of gold.

275
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So I don't, I don't know how to square the, the gold standard way of doing money with those facts and maybe somebody in the audience does.

276
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Okay. All right. So here's what I've learned Andrew and it may not be correct, but first of all, I think you're confusing two things.

277
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The gold's equating the gold standard to the way money works in circulation.

278
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So let's just remove that for a second and just say, we have want them, you know, or sticks or whatever.

279
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And these sticks are attributed to value and everyone agrees that, you know, a stick has an intrinsic value either by its length or perhaps if we use paper sticks by the number written on it and it was, you know, and there's a known amount of this in circulation.

280
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So what you say, I have to agree that if we all have an equal amount of sticks.

281
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Someone's going to wind up with, as we start to trade and buy goods and services from each other, you know, at times you'll have less and then if you have some good services or products, then you know, you'll make more.

282
00:18:44,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And I think that this is exactly where a central bank comes into play because in order to manage that economy, depending on how hard this economy works and what they produce or if they're mainly consumption focused.

283
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And, you know, this, of course, is now now you're getting into some heavy shit economics because, you know, that it then imports and exports come into what this leave all of this to the side.

284
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This is just a village.

285
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You probably could get around, you know, just with the sticks, right, but that would depend on if you wanted to buy something that you didn't have enough sticks for.

286
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And so that's where banking comes into play.

287
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So when you have a central bank, then there is an entity, a force, a regardless of who it is, that manages a lot of that economy by putting more sticks into the pool.

288
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And this, of course, is extremely interesting because how many sticks do you need to have to lend, how many sticks can you lend out to someone based upon how many sticks you have.

289
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So immediate conventional childish thinking as well, if I have 10 sticks, I can lend people 10 sticks.

290
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Well, that's not exactly what is going on because we have fractional reserve banking.

291
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And I bet you that that's going to be Andrew's next question.

292
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So the gold standard is a different topic altogether, Andrew.

293
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I believe that, you know, okay, so I believe that the reason why we don't just live in a society with an equal amount of sticks for everyone is because society grows.

294
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And because of that growth or, you know, with international important exports balance has to be, you hear these words all the time, you know, nice start to think about what they mean, right, what is the trade balance, well, it's an important part of the economy to understand the value of your sticks.

295
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Inflation of prices, et cetera, all of it really there's an equal and opposite reaction for everything that is done.

296
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And this, of course, is what all this interest rate talk is all about.

297
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
To now on to Andrew's next question.

298
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And then there's the second one, which is the, the fractional reserve lending system.

299
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I want to say that you said on yesterday's show that a bank could lend 10 times what it had, which it's kind of misleading.

300
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I think that I've done some reading about this and I think what the role is this for each hundred dollars a bank receives into posits.

301
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It can turn around and invest something like 90% of that.

302
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So that's a fundamental difference the way I've read it and I and I also have looked around and again, I could be wrong.

303
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It is my understanding that fractional reserve banking works by you have 10 sticks and you're allowed to lend out 10 times that amount.

304
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So you have to have at least 10% of it in or that whatever you have in deposits, you can lend out 10 times that.

305
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And I presume that only works if your bank is ensured of the some other deal going on in the background.

306
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You know, of course, that's exactly what happens when there's a run on the bank.

307
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There's a run on the bank then, you know, all those 10 other people come running and say, hey.

308
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Wait a minute, I'm saying it the wrong way.

309
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
See how fucking complicated this is.

310
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:36,000
There's a run on the bank then all the people who've actually deposited money start taking it out, but that has a like a multiplier domino effect on what you have outstanding.

311
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And of course banks don't just lend out, they borrow all the time.

312
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's the business.

313
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
The business is borrowing and lending of money and arbitraging.

314
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So in other words, bilo sell high and this can be thousands of percentages of dollars.

315
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But if you have enough of them, they start to add up.

316
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And of course lending at the end of the day is always based on trust.

317
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Right, that might be where the 10 to one number comes from, but there's a limit.

318
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The Federal Reserve sets a limit on, you know, the fraction of that hundred dollars at the bank and then turn around and invest.

319
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And it kind of, I mean, it makes sense to me in a certain way that the bank should be able to take that money and essentially make money from it, right?

320
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That is, well, not make money in the printing money sense, but rather make money in the be profitable sense, right?

321
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
A bank is a business.

322
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:37,000
They have, they've got to, you know, run the ATM machines and then the bank branches and whatever else they do.

323
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So in order to make money, they essentially take your money and they invest it, right?

324
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So you give them a hundred dollars and if they were required to keep that hundred dollars in their safe, they wouldn't have a way to be profitable, right?

325
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So I guess the question is, you know, how much of that should they be able to invest?

326
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And where do the limits come from and what are the implications of that?

327
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So those are kind of my two points in this discussion.

328
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm really curious to see if anybody out there has some thoughts about anyway.

329
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Thanks for having the discussion, really enjoying following it.

330
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And that's all for now.

331
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
All right, bye Andrew.

332
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And by the way, you know, I know you don't call it an orphan Andrew, but come on, get with it, man.

333
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Do some of the official sign-off, Lingo, will you?

334
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Yes, so you may have received this PowerPoint that's been doing the rounds on the internet, which explains the banking crisis.

335
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And it's kind of a humoristic cartoon, essentially showing how all of these lending and borrowing institutions.

336
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And by the way, that includes us.

337
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You know, what Andrew would call investing, what a bank does, another would call borrowing or, for instance, if I buy a house and I have a mortgage, I put down 10%.

338
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Right?

339
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So if it's a hundred thousand dollar house, I put down ten thousand dollars.

340
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I borrow ninety thousand dollars.

341
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
The house goes up in value.

342
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I've just doubled my money.

343
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Yeah, as sure there's a little bit of a loss for the interest that I've had to pay, but that's exactly what banks do.

344
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
They do it with all kinds of things with the exchanging of money.

345
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
They do it with investments.

346
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
They do it with all kinds of financial instruments.

347
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It's coming up with different ways to borrow money at a lower cost than you can lend it out to someone that's the basic business.

348
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So anyway, so I'm amazed at how people, particularly with a couple of visual aids, are able to really explain this quite succinctly.

349
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And in fact, I got a voice comment here, which kind of explains the Federal Reserve in under a minute.

350
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Hi, Adam, Eric from Portland.

351
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
This whole Federal Reserve thing is a little complex for some people to get their minds around.

352
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And I've found a nicer way to an easy way for people to understand it is to just pull out a dollar bill and look at it.

353
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It is not just a dollar bill.

354
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's a contract.

355
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
If you look at the top of it on the face side, you look at the top of it.

356
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It's going to say Federal Reserve, Federal Reserve note.

357
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
That's the lender.

358
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Down there, there's little signatures at the contract signing for the American People's

359
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
at Treasure and the Secretary of the Treasury.

360
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Those are the borrowers and they're signing on our behalf on the American People's behalf.

361
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So look at a dollar bill as just a simple contract.

362
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And you'll realize that that contract is just paper and it's not backed by anything.

363
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Hope that helps.

364
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It certainly helps for some part.

365
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Why is it that our political leaders?

366
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Why is it that why don't they just take the time out?

367
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Take five minutes and explain in simple terms because this stuff is simple.

368
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I mean, yeah, it seems very complicated because there's lots of zeroes and it's, you know,

369
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
and it's intricately linked to all kinds of other systems and issues.

370
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
But I think basic economics is, it wouldn't be bad.

371
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You know, well, we can't expect that from President Bush.

372
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But why doesn't Obama take some time and just say that or Hillary?

373
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Oh, she really understands it.

374
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Just explain how it works where the money comes from, you know,

375
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:20,000
explain this situation to the people so that we as, as a world population,

376
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
because it is interlinked throughout the world.

377
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
This is not just a problem in the United States.

378
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
So we can all understand it and then we can educate ourselves.

379
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And then stay away from the pitfalls in the future, which in this case in the subprime mortgage crisis

380
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,000
was that we didn't understand exactly how the adjustable rate mortgages worked

381
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
and that refinancing is only possible if the housing value continues to rise

382
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and it's not a set given fact that house prices always go up.

383
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Very, very simple things.

384
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You know, so instead of people saying, we were dupped by them and they screwed us.

385
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Now, you've got to educate yourself.

386
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But I think we deserve some of that from our leaders.

387
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And I don't mind being patronized a little bit like I'm some idiot because clearly I am.

388
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I don't understand this stuff.

389
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
No wonder a lot of smart people I know understand it.

390
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Thank you to the BBC who had a fantastic program on last night,

391
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
called the Super Rich, the greed game.

392
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And you can get on the BBC eye player if you're still in the UK.

393
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It's good for another six days.

394
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I hope that although I don't like piracy, but I think it's such a good piece of work.

395
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And of course, it has been paid for by the British populace.

396
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I hope someone puts that out there like on YouTube or Google video.

397
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So that other people can see it all hunter-round for it.

398
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But it's just a fantastic show.

399
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
A little over the top about the super rich.

400
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's like blah, blah, blah, whatever.

401
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But just understanding what happened and why the system broke down.

402
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Then all of a sudden you can put it in perspective.

403
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And you see all these bank guys, the guys in the strip bars.

404
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I understand that they just overplayed their hand and overplayed the game.

405
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And there was not their own elders and people responsible.

406
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Played along and did really educate them as to what could happen.

407
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And we screwed up.

408
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
We'll get out of it.

409
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I do like this news that I saw from...

410
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Who sent this to me.

411
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I think that Naly Cruz, of course, is the...

412
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
What is her exact title, the competition minister?

413
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
She's the one that makes sure a company says play honest.

414
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
She is now starting investigations into the state bailout of Northern Rock.

415
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Because there are European rules against doing this.

416
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
We can't have all of individual member states of the European Union.

417
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Just willingly going around and bailing out whatever and whatever they want.

418
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And of course, that's where a lot of the dissatisfaction comes from.

419
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And that is just the anger that builds up inside of us.

420
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But if we understand better what's going on, then we'll be able to combat that in many different levels, including political.

421
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You know, your kids can run for office, you know.

422
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It's not too late to let them know that.

423
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I don't know where I was going with that crap.

424
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So I almost want to rewind what I just said.

425
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I was on the roll.

426
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Anyway, we'll work on it.

427
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I need your help, those savants.

428
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Let us know what's going on, okay?

429
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Hey Adam, it's Jack.

430
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Are the multiculturalism discussion?

431
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I think it's a dangerous to lump a whole group of people based on the actions of a few violent,

432
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
so-so-siffrous minority.

433
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
As it is dangerous to lump all journalists based on the faux-siffrous idiotic Glenn Beck.

434
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Okay, point will made podcaster for me to know in his Jack.

435
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Actually, it just came to me when I was talking about,

436
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
thank you, Jack, for kind of jogging my memory there.

437
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So what really gets people angry is you see these crises brought on by big institutions.

438
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And yes, in some cases, very wealthy people.

439
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And it hurts everybody, but the people who get helped by the government, for a number of reasons, not just altruistic,

440
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:25,000
but a number of reasons, seem to be these large institutions and wealthy people, and seemingly they therefore have no risk to taking even greater risks.

441
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:33,000
There's no downside. There's no repercussions for them taking that type of risk. Of course, in recession, the little guy and we all get fucked.

442
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And that makes you angry. Angry. So you want to we all get angry, but at the same time educate ourselves on what the hell is going on.

443
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
We understand that we can definitely change it. And you can do that because at the end of the day, who is it based on?

444
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Right? Who was the subprime mortgage based on? Who was the housing boom based on?

445
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Based on us. Based on us borrowing to buy.

446
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Selling at a profit, going back, refinancing, borrowing to buy, buy sell, buy low sell, high, make money, party, party.

447
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
We did it. So within we can stop it, right? It's that simple.

448
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You know, but this whole day thing is just, I should stop that myself and I think you should consider it because it's just going a little bit out of hand.

449
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Now, of course, to educate yourself and this is something that I've been working on as a personal mission.

450
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
It's, you know, there's so much information coming in. And in fact, I use Google News as an example of this.

451
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
If you just go to news.google.com, you'll see a whole bunch of stories in different categories.

452
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And these are all aggregated and supposedly the the hot stories bubble to the top, but they've got a whole bunch of different things.

453
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Different, like, showbees, entertainment sports, etc. Now, I really look at sports ever.

454
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I saw on the page. But what I'm trying to do now is when I see a headline.

455
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
The first thing I, I, before clicking on it because that's where you go down the rabbit hole.

456
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Before clicking on it, I'm like, do I really need to know this?

457
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Will it enrich my life? Will it make any difference to me at this moment?

458
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I mean, unless you're in like a major major leisure time moment.

459
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You know, like, here's one, Britney, anything Britney Spears. You know, those headlines are, are you just want to click on like, oh my gosh.

460
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And you know, instead of going into why I want to click on it.

461
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's like, what is the benefit going to be? I'm not even just not going to click on that link. You know, it's all right.

462
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So I'll sound stupid by not knowing what happened to her.

463
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You know, I'll live with that. I'll know, you know, I'll click on things that I really evaluate for second.

464
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Because when you click on like a Britney link and this, of course, is what publishes are very good at and what I try to do myself is,

465
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
you know, they draw you in and here's another link to click on it. Get more info and see more pictures before you know it.

466
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
What the hell was I was trying to get the news? Wasn't I? So evaluate this stuff. You know, don't just click Willy and Lily.

467
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
That's probably not a very good idea.

468
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And sometimes, of course, you just have to be in your leisure time mode and whether you're watching, whether you're clicking around and Googling things or whether you're watching certain types of television.

469
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Well, you know, that's a moment where you can, you know, you think you're resting your brain. You aren't really, but at least you can put some different impulses in there.

470
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,000
But when you're really focused on getting some information and learning something or when you're just just news in general, this is a good thing.

471
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Anything you see evaluate why you're going to click on that link.

472
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
It would probably boost our economy by a trillion dollars if you all did that.

473
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It would save us a lot of time jerking off doing nothing.

474
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Adam, it's Chris and Nashville.

475
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I've been listening to Noah Jen the number 24 and the park where John is saying that these shows are detrimental to our mental state of being.

476
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
He's absolutely right.

477
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm sick and tired of all those big brother, you know, all this reality bullshit.

478
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's just,

479
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I only played a little bit of that for one reason because for those, and a lot of you listened to Noah Jen does well, I know.

480
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And we kind of had a cliffhanger that we left on the last show.

481
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So of course, a new one coming up this weekend.

482
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And I need to provide a rebuttal because, and this is why I wanted to just say this for a second.

483
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I did not say I'm a fan, because this is, we had a whole conversation.

484
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And I said, I was a fan of a certain type of reality programming.

485
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Namely, the talent contest with voting and honest judges.

486
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And that and, and there was one specific example of honesty.

487
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And that'll be part of my rebuttal, which was Jerry Springers, nothing but the truth.

488
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I just want to say this has nothing to do with big brother, although that, I can say a lot about that as well.

489
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But in general, I will be talking in my rebuttal about reality television.

490
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And why I do believe that there is value to that genre.

491
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And it should be an interesting show.

492
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So Friday or Saturday, you never know when we released that.

493
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Hey, Noah, let's play a song.

494
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Something I found on the podcast music network just uploaded this morning.

495
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And there's nothing better than the Rolling Stones than our Rolling Stones tribute band with their own material.

496
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And they have the only one going without giving up.

497
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Straighten all my hands at the end.

498
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You're gonna ask a pause and you're gonna...

499
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Let's go find where the old drone.

500
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And I just stand with different lines.

501
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I'll figure out where the river is.

502
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
My shows are ready to die.

503
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Oh yeah.

504
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Oh yeah.

505
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Oh yeah.

506
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Oh yeah.

507
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Oh yeah.

508
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Oh yeah.

509
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Oh yeah.

510
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Oh yeah.

511
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Oh.

512
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Oh yeah.

513
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Oh yeah.

514
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Ah.

515
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Oh yeah.

516
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Oh yes.

517
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Oh yeah.

518
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Oh.

519
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Oh.

520
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
For the chamber of the smaaaight

521
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
You're probably scared of past me

522
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Let the show with perfect size

523
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And I'll come back to your body

524
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Let me summon you

525
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Get it out for me now

526
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Just for me to say

527
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Okay, I'll come home from

528
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I just need your help

529
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Oh yeah

530
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Oh

531
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
When is the minister

532
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Of the moment you raise

533
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And these objects are self-known

534
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Self-love

535
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Self-righteousness

536
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Why the victim is convicted

537
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Running out to steal them

538
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I guess you're falling into the moon

539
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And your flesh rip by your chain

540
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Oh yeah

541
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I thought that was kind of interesting

542
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
The name was really what caught my eye

543
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
The power goats

544
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Deep love

545
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
That attention to potting music

546
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Now we're going to force I will share the location of this band

547
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And their music on the PMN

548
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Through the show notes at the daily source code

549
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
At daily source code.com

550
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Actually

551
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Okay, I think we're going to leave it at that for today

552
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Because it'll want to think about

553
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And I'm still in the middle of my learning journey

554
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And my quest

555
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So I will turn it over to the sabons

556
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
You know how to reach me at

557
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Adam at podshow.com

558
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Of course if you look at the show notes

559
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You can find the

560
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Phone numbers to call in

561
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And leave some feedback

562
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Keep it short

563
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
If possible

564
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
In fact, can't someone out there

565
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Describe how our economy works

566
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And how the Federal Reserve works

567
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And how certain elements or discussions

568
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
We've talked about in under 60 seconds

569
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I mean, that should be possible

570
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Something that I can just

571
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Fire off an MP3 to my daughter

572
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And she'll understand it

573
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Wouldn't that be amazing?

574
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Wouldn't we be doing something interesting?

575
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
All right everybody

576
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Thank you very much for listening

577
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I think the live 365 stream

578
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Wasn't too great today

579
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I'm not quite sure what the problem is

580
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Also our bandwidth here as you know

581
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Is severely hampered by the

582
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
The illegality of a teenager

583
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Who needs more speaking to

584
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Before I start closing a port

585
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Because that of course is the ultimate

586
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Why to get whatever I want

587
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Tomorrow I have some more dental work

588
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Being done so I don't know if I'll do a show

589
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But Friday definitely full on

590
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Fubar I hope we'll have the stream up

591
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And running perfectly so get your songs in

592
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Early so we can crank it out

593
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Have a maximum music good time

594
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Live your life with passion

595
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And because that is something you control

596
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And while others don't control all of it

597
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Enjoy your freedom

598
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Another pop show podcast

599
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Stick it in your ear
