129
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Okay,だ that's why I don't answer,

130
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,400
Gilford asked tripping me out, man, and we didn't hear a single thing that must have been six

131
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,160
fire trucks, the guy said Friday night into Saturday, you know, we were home, and we were

132
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,560
watching TV hanging out, didn't hear a thing. Now, the houses aren't that close together,

133
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,080
but still damn. First of all, to have a burglary take place, and then have the place to

134
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,320
march. The guy's like, well, now you have something to tell Patricia, I said, I think not,

135
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,480
I don't think we're going to be doing that. Anyway, if you want to participate in today's show,

136
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,960
I got a roll over my wire, and we go. I'm still not going to do Skype calls just yet, but I am

137
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,640
watching Twitter and people are already feeding back, so that's how they appreciated. And I

138
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,640
listened back to yesterday's show, you know, there were some weird things with the sound levels,

139
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,840
which are technical and was my fault. It was very cool I have to say to be talking about

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,760
something, and about a minute into the topic, then all of a sudden some responses or some

141
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,600
input would pop up on Twitter. It works. It's kind of interesting, so I'm going to keep it at

142
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,560
this level for now before we bring people in. Of course, we always have people on the show.

143
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,800
It's just we don't bring them in live at this point in time, at this juncture. Of course,

144
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,080
the guy who does the opening for the Daily Source Code PD Love from Lovehouse Radio, we all know

145
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,520
and love him. He's a parent, and he does some daddy cast, and he's concerned about this DNA

146
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,200
testing and called in. So, of course, we want to hear from PD Love. Hey, Adam PD Love from Lovehouse

147
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:30,720
Radio, and the Daddy cast. You're talking about this DNA typing, and you're discussion with

148
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,640
about all this stuff that they can do with this. Let me just let me just interrupt for people just

149
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,760
tuning in either to the stream or the podcast. So, this is a guy from the Scotland Yard who said,

150
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,840
you know what, we should have a debate. He didn't say we should start doing it, but we should have a debate

151
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,960
about starting the test kids as a five years of age to see if they have any criminal behavior

152
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,480
DNA. And if so, then we can put them into special training. I think you just rip them out of the womb.

153
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,720
Doing an amniot. Why wait until they're five? Why bother? So, this, of course, is stirring a

154
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,760
lot of shit up, and that's what PD Love is calling about. You really get reminds me when you were,

155
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,520
you know, talking to the lady Patricia about, you know, that making you watching what you eat,

156
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,000
and then start dictating what you eat, and that's not a thing. You reminds me of a book I'd be

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,040
a friend of mine and I had back about 16 years ago, and we started working on it, didn't finish it,

158
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:31,680
but there's all doubts. At the time, all the different tobacco lawsuits going on, and some

159
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,800
of the same players from today, but Nationalized Health Care, that kind of thing, and our premise

160
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,680
was that the government had Nationalized Health Care, and now they had the right to treat every citizen,

161
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,080
almost like a fleet vehicle in a corporation. They got to tell you what you got to eat.

162
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,000
They got to tell you when to go in for your check-ups, so they got to tell you, you know, what,

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,200
you know, they basically owned the bodies of the people.

164
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,360
Oh, wait until they insert the chip dude, when you get your RFID chip inserted,

165
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,360
if you don't play by the rules, they just turn your money off. Oh, I'm sorry, your chip no longer

166
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,400
allows you to withdraw cash when making any payments. You watch. And I guess that's one of my big

167
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,800
things about all this talk about in your health care reform and Nationalizing things. Where's

168
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,200
it stop? Where? You know, they're taking DNA to figure out what type of person you are,

169
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,720
what if they get it wrong for one thing? Let's not, sorry, we've incarcerated 5,000 people

170
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,960
because we forgot to carry the one. But basically, if they're going to start doing these types

171
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,600
of things, if the government is going to start owning the citizens, then we've given up our freedom.

172
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,560
We've given up our freedom. We've given up our freedom. We've given up our freedom. We've given up our freedom.

173
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:46,960
Oh, dude. PD, start. If they're going to start, we will give up our freedom. Oh, man, please.

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,240
Oh, please. You're all ready working for tax money for gas money right now. That's what most of us

175
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,520
are working for. Just to be able to put the go juice into the machines, the audio owner's

176
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:05,920
dude. And it's not the government, okay? It's not the government. It's the banks. It's the rich families.

177
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:15,360
It's names like Goldman, Oppenheimer, Rockefeller, JP Morgan Chase. These are the people who own us.

178
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,600
Look at it. They own, they own all the mortgages. She got to work for that with a kick out of your

179
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:29,600
house. That's my definition of ownership right there. A lot, obviously. And that's what scares me about

180
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,800
these different things. It looks so good from the own setting. It looks like all they're protecting

181
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,480
me there. They're giving health care to everybody there. They're socializing medicine and to

182
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,760
make it available to everybody. But at the same time, they're owning you. They're owning the people

183
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,480
that you're giving stuff away. Nothing comes for free. And if they're going to own your body,

184
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,560
they're going to tell you, okay, you need to exercise more. So we're going to start making sure

185
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,560
you log exercise, you know, running miles every winter day. And only eating these certain foods.

186
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,880
And by the way, if you get sick, we're going to, you know, take your body and we're going to

187
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,960
rejuvenate it, but we're going to give it to somebody else. You know what, and you give your organs away.

188
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:17,360
We worried about it. So anyway, I think this whole subject is just very scary. And I agree with the

189
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,000
caller. Don't touch my kids. I think it would James have said. Don't touch my kids. That's the

190
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,440
same way I feel. So keep the DNA guys away. Anyway, love you, mean it. No homo, great hair, hope you

191
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,120
win, and try there's something else that they added to that. But talk to you later, Adam. Bye bye.

192
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,160
Well, dude, let me just tell you your kids are already in the DNA database, okay? When they're

193
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,360
born in the United States, DNA blood samples are taken. And I'm pretty sure that this stuff

194
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,080
remains good. You know, it's like you can look, there's stuff in the database. They have the DNA.

195
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,720
You know, so they may not have tested all the theories on it. But as far as I know, the DNA is the DNA.

196
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,920
It's in the database. I'm not a DNA expert. By the way, shout out, we could use a DNA

197
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,720
subont on the Charlie. That's for sure. I was talking to a buddy of mine last night. In the Netherlands,

198
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,080
there's this thing one week after your child is born, you have to go back to the hospital

199
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:22,960
for a heal prick. That's on the database, didn't it? A prick in a Dutch is a, is a jab,

200
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:31,360
is you know, a needle. Okay. We're in the tower of Babble today. So they, they jab your, your kid

201
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,560
in their heel. And what they're doing there is they're taking a sample for some no well-known diseases.

202
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:44,240
And this friend of mine, person actually had a slight DNA malformity, I guess it's called.

203
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,240
And they were aware of it and then he's fine, you know, it's just some minor, minor shit.

204
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,280
Of course, the minor shit in that area can be quite major, so I don't want to downplay it.

205
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:04,000
But they found out that their sons DNA had been added to a DNA database without their permission.

206
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,440
It had already just been done just by default. So I'm sure it's all in there. I don't know

207
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,360
when this started, I don't remember DNA taking place in the 60s. So I'm probably not in it, but

208
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:21,600
dude, it's bad. Let's see if you want to participate in the show today, then just

209
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:30,560
just shoot me a tweet. You can go to Twitter.com and sign up. It's Adam Curry, all one word. That's

210
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,360
we want to follow me and that's what we want to send direct messages to. So my

211
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,600
Dodds is listening to the live stream on live 365 and he sent me a link here about the bank

212
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,400
of England and the Federal Reserve denying a report that they're in talks over possibly using

213
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,920
public funds to make mass purchases of mortgage back securities to ease the global credit crisis.

214
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,080
However, the bank of England said it was considering a number of other unspecified

215
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,840
options to address the turmoil and financial markets, which is continued despite the injection

216
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,560
by central banks of billions of dollars of liquidity and cuts and interest rates. Well,

217
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,840
let me tell you, of course, they're going to use public funds. Oh, actually, technically they're not.

218
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,720
They're just going to print some more money. Okay? They print it up. That's what banks are.

219
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,880
Banks are money creation companies and they're all commercial. Particularly the Federal Reserve.

220
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,160
So yeah, and this whole thing with JP Morgan and with Bear Stearns, this quote buyout,

221
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,880
that was just they printed up $30 billion. So that effectively devalues the money in your pocket.

222
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,240
Thanks, guys. Hope you all had a nice weekend. So I'm pretty sure, uh, oh, John Arnold says it's

223
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,280
called a heel prick test here in the UK as well, off to all children born in the UK by default.

224
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,400
Well, in the US, he'll prick mean something completely different. So let's just stay away from that show.

225
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:58,080
It's one of the pod save music network. Jersey Todd sent me this. This is an Olympic gold medalist

226
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:05,520
winner who's now got a record out on the P.D. M.A. and Cardi Patterson, temporary life ordinary girl.

227
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:32,880
This time it just won't stop raining on my parade. Time has come to speck on me waiting for me to fade

228
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:52,400
away into the graves. And I tried to tell myself, it's not where I'm going to be wrong.

229
00:15:52,400 --> 00:16:01,680
It is a time for everything that I've been in for way too long. I'm not as good for the world.

230
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,680
I'm just an ordinary girl but I'm a person yet out of this temporary life.

231
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:18,880
It can't be like this forever. Someday it's gonna change, but that someday it's coming too far

232
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:29,840
and I don't want to wave my phone let me pretend but I won't let this be the end of me. No way, no way

233
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:39,200
I might need somebody shorter to catch the sins I cry and even with no end it's that I know I will survive.

234
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:55,120
I won't break me in my take all I need to get back where I want to be. And I gotta tell myself

235
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:04,160
it's not where I'm going to be wrong. It is a time for everything that I've been in for way too long

236
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:15,440
I'm not as good for the world. I'm just an ordinary girl but I'm a person yet out of this temporary life.

237
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:24,800
It can't be like this forever. Don't exactly know where I'm going but any place is better than where I am.

238
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:33,760
This is not a permanent situation. I'm going back to where I began

239
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:47,600
Where I used to run for the world. It's a time for everything that I've been in for way too long

240
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:57,600
I'm just an ordinary girl but I'm a person yet out of this temporary life.

241
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:05,600
It's not where I used to run for everything that I've been in for way too long

242
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:13,600
I'm not as good for the world. I'm just an ordinary girl but I'm a person yet out of this house

243
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:23,600
I'm just an ordinary girl but I'm a person yet out of this temporary life

244
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Well I'd say she's anything but an ordinary girl when she's not

245
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Carly Patterson from the Potset Music Network links to that of course in the show notes today at resourceco.com

246
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,600
I try to put in links to everything in the show notes including songs that are not on the PMN

247
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,600
In that case I try to link to DRM Free MP3s and Amazon.com

248
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,600
I've been having a lot of good success there. A lot of this old stuff unfortunately is not available on e-music

249
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
You know we have a great promotion going on with e-music.com

250
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,600
If you go to e-music.com slash daily source code you will receive 35 free songs

251
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,600
No obligation whatsoever. It's the best deal anywhere that you can find for e-music.com

252
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,600
There's a lot of potsafe stuff on there so I'm actually considering

253
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,600
We've been to talks with these guys. We should link up the database that we have and if artists want to sell songs on e-music

254
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,600
With just it should be a check box, right? Something really really simple

255
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Anyway working on all that

256
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:26,600
I often bitch about the audience and understanding the makeup of it. By the way, if you have not looked at the survey

257
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,600
I think it's actually it's time to do another results

258
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,600
You know we did got that nice graph that I put up on curry.com a while ago

259
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,600
But people continue to enter their information. I think we have about a thousand entries now

260
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,600
You can find the link in the show notes at daily source code.com and curry.com

261
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Nicely cross-posted

262
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,600
And well sometimes I'm not entirely right about the makeup of the audience

263
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
And boy did you guys let me know all about it

264
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Hey Adam, this is Gabe from San Diego, California

265
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:08,600
I'm just calling because I heard a couple of DSC's back ago that you said that only middle age and braille

266
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,600
The people just know the DSC will. I'm 24 years old and I like your show

267
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:23,600
So I'm also going to respond to the DNA story that you just mentioned

268
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:34,600
That I've heard that there's a movie called 46 that uses the DNA story as a background

269
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,600
To a future society where everyone has to be placed under insurance

270
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:48,600
And they somehow have these restrictions in this thing where you can't make babies

271
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Because if you have the similar DNA to your father, mother, uncle, brother

272
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:58,600
And I'll insist all that stuff then it gets to crazy levels and all that stuff

273
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:08,600
So well I'm not sure how to end this call but I guess you could say I like to show

274
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Remember you an MTV and um, okay

275
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
I don't love you no homo and

276
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Hope you win. All right. Also please play based on your show

277
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
I've taken care of that part

278
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Also this Friday I got a call from James of North

279
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,600
I believe on Channel 5 they're going to play the movie Gattica

280
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,600
If you're in the United Kingdom, you want to watch that

281
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,600
It's a very esoteric kind of new wave

282
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Ardy funky science fiction piece

283
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,600
To put it mildly and it's rather long

284
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,600
But if you really get into the story and you're not disturbed by any outside

285
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,600
You know, this is the kind of thing you want to throw on the plasma

286
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,600
You want to crank the sound up, turn down the house lights

287
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Light up a big split and rock and roll

288
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,600
And it'll trip you out. I just got a Twitter here from from PWb

289
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
Our satellite repairman

290
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
He says that for some reason live 365

291
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,600
He's not available to get it or it's off air or something like that

292
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
No, it looks like people run

293
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
So I don't know what's going on

294
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600
I'm glad I'm still doing these tests. There's do this so much to

295
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,600
Look at and and think about

296
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,600
While there's also words supposed to be coming out of my mouth sometimes it gets very difficult

297
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Yesterday I played this piece by a guy named Pat Condell

298
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,600
And he basically opened up from a British perspective

299
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
In a very typical British way

300
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,600
And just let loose on the whole idea of the multicultural society

301
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,600
And it was just it was just filled with with very

302
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Very heavily loaded interesting stuff

303
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,600
And I asked you guys to perform some homework

304
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,600
Check this guy side out telling what you think about it

305
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
This appears to be

306
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,600
The type of talk that's going on behind closed doors

307
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Not just in the United Kingdom but all across Europe

308
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
In fact there was a demonstration over the weekend

309
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,600
In damn square and Amsterdam against the Dutch politician

310
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Heard builders who's coming out with this quote

311
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Anti islam

312
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Or anti-coron movie

313
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,600
A 15 minute movie is not a long movie by the way

314
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
And there was a big protest on the dam

315
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Well it depends on how you look at it

316
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,600
You know there was a like 1500 people

317
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Some say you know maybe it was 5000 but just looking at the pictures

318
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,600
And I know dam square it looked like it was you know

319
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,600
1500 maybe 2000 tops

320
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,600
And previous demonstrations that have taken place on dam square

321
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Have been a million people

322
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
To stop nuclear deployment

323
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
I mean I've seen huge crowds there

324
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,600
So that leads me to believe that this indeed is probably a conversation

325
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,600
It's going on taking place behind closed doors

326
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,600
And hey if this is independent media and the mainstream media is not

327
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Bringing this to the forefront I think that I should

328
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Because I'm just a conduit

329
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,600
Parkie who's been really active helping me out with the show lately

330
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Sending in good links and stories called in and had the following to say about Mr. Pat Condell

331
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,600
Hi there Mr. Parkie checking in from a rather noisy city of London

332
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,600
I just listened to the last show with Pat Condell

333
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,600
I just wanted to let you know that I've been subscribing to this podcast

334
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,600
For about six months now and I've been encouraged

335
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,600
And everybody you listen to 30 source code

336
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
To go and listen to his back catalogue of podcasts

337
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,600
And sometimes you'll do a bit of baking in the earlier shows

338
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Just kind of mono-ish but you'll get there

339
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Again, sometimes he's opinion about some opinion

340
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
But by the same token I think you're absolutely right

341
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,600
It doesn't take the pulse of a lot of UK British feeling

342
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,600
I don't think he's a racist I don't think he's got some very strong opinions

343
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,600
He lays into Christianity, Judaism, Islam

344
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Almost everybody I think he just doesn't like organised religions

345
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,600
And yeah just get your guys to check out all of his podcast

346
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Listen from number one because I think he sets a thing quite well there

347
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
All right, take out Tuesday

348
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,600
All right, and I park you thanks keep the good stuff coming man

349
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Appreciate all the feedback and the input and of course

350
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,600
It always takes a couple of days before people really get into the swing of a conversation

351
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Yeah, we're just now really getting into the DNA issue

352
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,600
And that of course is because of the delayed nature of podcasting

353
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
Which is kind of interesting

354
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600

380
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:20,600
uh for those of you uh checking it out on the live stream today live through 65.com don't

381
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,040
tell me you couldn't keep your feet still. Party Ben just makes you want to jump up and

382
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:30,600
dance, honey. Calling up the pieces. Be more remakes of course average white band mixed in

383
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,080
there with uh what uh what the hell is the name of the song picking up the pieces there you go.

384
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,400
Elio, Elio. Well that's just quite interesting. I must say I'm enjoying uh doing the show

385
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,040
knowing that there are people listening to the live stream. For some reason it gives me

386
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:51,080
something extra there. It doesn't feel like I'm just talking into Hild. You know, Hild,

387
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,640
Hild is the microphone I'm using to talk into. It feels like there's someone out there.

388
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,400
Uh and even though Pete Obs seems to have some kind of problem getting on uh to the live stream

389
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,120
everyone else says it's working fine. Okay. Hey, let me see. Oh, this actually I've been holding

390
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:10,200
back on this comment for a while is from uh our buddy Trucker Tom uh who has been doing a lot

391
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:16,280
with HD um and we have some HD channels uh they're moving through rotation so you can find those uh

392
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:22,280
at podshow.com uh they'll be highlighted on the home page as well uh but they are available now already

393
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:29,240
and uh you can probably find a couple of them through uh Trucker Trucker Tom himself um and he's

394
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,840
you know it Trucker Tom not just a Trucker dude the guy is a visionary which means he can see into the

395
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:42,520
future and can feel what's coming. Then I think he's right. Yo Adam. Yo Tom while's here aka

396
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:49,560
Trucker Tom. We're gonna talk a little bit about the Apple TV version 2 software. Right, this is the

397
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:55,480
the new version of Apple TV that came out uh uh a free update I believe. By the, I read somewhere

398
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:01,960
it's not available for the leopard yet but under tiger I guess tiger um under the previous version

399
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:10,040
of Apple's OS 10 uh OS you can actually download um something that'll run that software. It's

400
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:16,120
not available for leopard yet I can't wait uh when it is available uh I'm gonna be loading it up

401
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:21,880
you know I will. Just so I can screw up my setup again installing software dangerous business.

402
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:29,320
Update? Of course I was one of the original people early adopters of the uh Apple TV and it was so

403
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:37,880
so it basically uh turned your TV your home theater system into an iPod outlet basically uh but

404
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:45,160
the version 2 software is really cool because it allows you to forget about the computer, forget about

405
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:53,240
iTunes and surf your multimedia right on your HD TV set using the uh little remote control that

406
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:59,960
comes with the Apple TV. Of course you can surf through uh podcasts and not necessarily the podcast

407
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,720
I'm subscribed to an iTunes because I listened to those on my iPod but it lets you know I found myself

408
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,000
kind of surf surfing through other podcasts for topics I'd never thought about while I was in

409
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:17,080
front of my computer so it's a much better uh user experience and I think that it's going to

410
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,960
help out podcasting getting it out beyond that uh and getting it to the television

411
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,000
you know whatever we can do to get it to the television and get it to the home theater where people

412
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,720
can easily uh kind of surf through it with a remote control is a good thing anyhow I hope to see you

413
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:43,800
at the uh new media expo and later this year in Las Vegas I hope you're able to come

414

434
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,800
restless for the song and yes indeed I played it for you

435
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:21,720
and you know who you are learning lots of great things here on on the Twitter feedback loop

436
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,960
again it's really cool because you know Twitter if it refreshes once every three minutes or

437
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:32,600
something and that's when it brings in new messages so I'm probably just at the

438
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:37,240
the cusp of changing the topic or in the middle of the song and just the timing is really

439
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,680
really interesting

440
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,880
Matt Millard or Miller said check out quoteably dot com quoteably dot com slash

441
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,400
Adam Curry you can follow the entire thread of all of what people are saying about you on Twitter

442
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,680
and of course that updates a little more frequently I guess than then Twitter vision

443
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,440
whatever the what does it Twitter was it in that one's called it's Twitter Rific

444
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,240
Twitter vision that's a good one too Ron Stoops says Tom trucker Tom is more than a visionary

445
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,760
he's a missionary a visionary sees the future a missionary makes the future that's the mission

446
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,720
I like the missionary position myself

447
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,280
alright one last rather long comment but well worth it so let's listen to you

448
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:22,120
hi Adam Scott here of Scott podcast.com I was listening to you talking on the latest podcast about

449
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:27,800
the security which you've talked about any number of times before and you're just like of a great

450
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,320
deal of it just on necessary and it sort of reminded me of something that I was thinking about the

451
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:41,320
other night I get a podcast which is nothing less and nothing more than the president's weekly radio

452
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:48,120
address to usually very short so I've listened to a few of these in the last couple

453
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:54,200
seem to bring forth what I'd call a common theme and that theme would be the theme of what I call

454
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:03,560
a Trump card that is for let's say for the liberals a Trump card would be a saying or something

455
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,600
that they bring forth that always seems to trump your argument and for liberals quite often that

456
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:15,800
would be well think of the children yeah yeah oh dude I hear you think of the kids it's all about

457
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:21,960
the children I believe the children are future yeah of course it's true but oh you're so right oh man

458
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,960
you should listen to Noah Jen if you have a if you have a chance Noah Jen that I'll podshow.com

459
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,480
a John C. to Boric and I all the time are listening for these keywords and these messages and

460
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,960
and this is a big one and I also subscribe to the president's weekly radio address that's what

461
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,800
it's called you could find it in my channels Adam dot podshow dot com you can get the whole channel

462
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,560
if you want so you can listen to and watch all the stuff that I'm listening and watching to

463
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:48,920
one a daily basis in my on the go channel it's the top one we can just subscribe to that individually

464
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,880
and put it to anywhere you want including in your own channel absolutely think about the children

465
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,160
but that's changed hasn't it's got you know that would kind of embody it in one phrase think of

466
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:05,240
the children what about the children right and that was the Trump card they'd play that to win all

467
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:11,160
kind of arguments well you know what the Trump card is for this administration I think you already

468
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:17,480
know yes it's not what about the children it's what about the terrorists yeah because I was listening

469
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:26,440
to two different presidential you know weekly addresses and in one he was well actually in both

470
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,720
of them he was trying to get different bills passed through the way he wanted to or in one case

471
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:37,640
he wanted to kill one off they were passing through a bill that would have kept him from

472
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:43,800
torturing and he didn't want that because he didn't say tortures and yeah this is all about the

473
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:52,840
water boarding yeah torture that interrogation techniques but he didn't want that because you know

474
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:58,040
the interrogation techniques sounds better that's good think about the children with your

475
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:03,400
interrogation techniques we don't want to torture children no wait a minute maybe I'm confused now

476
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,840
and then on the other one he was against the bill it was about allowing people to sue telephone

477
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:14,600
companies if they got too much into your privacy because again you know what about those terrorists we

478
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,960
won't be able to find them as well the argument on both of these podcasts or addresses was

479
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,240
exactly the same what are we going to do about those terrorists and I just thought about the whole concept

480
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:34,280
of you know Trump card you were also talking about the I think you're talking about where

481
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,400
terrorists come from or how they're formed what they're all about and I just wanted to tell you

482
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:47,080
about something that I used to see a number of years ago right so I think what I was saying at the

483
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:55,160
time which you're responding to is why why do people do this to us why are the terrorists doing the

484
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:02,600
things they're doing why and I just don't believe it's a religious thing okay neither should you

485
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,760
there's a lot going on there's a lot of reasons why where does it come from okay let's hear Scott's

486
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:15,320
version it was a gosh probably five or seven years ago I have a satellite dish and you can

487
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,720
watch stuff from around the world and one of the feeds it was up there was what they call

488
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:25,320
Masticila and it was a feed that was out of you know that part of the world we're all the

489
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:31,880
terrorists are coming from and what they were feeding on this over and over and over on Masticila TV

490
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,240
were videos showing people who were you know terrorists who were blowing themselves up and fighting

491
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:44,360
for the cause we used to call this musta killer you know we musta kill you anyway

492
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:52,520
something like that really is that still on because that's I I have access to some satellite

493
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:57,160
channel stuff and I can view that over here I wouldn't mind seeing what that's all about was that

494
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:03,160
it's for I'll kite a training channel in any case I've seen the kind of information that was being

495
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:10,360
shown to kids from a very young age made me wonder you know it does this work and you know

496
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,760
is this effective and would they be doing it if it wasn't effective but I just thought you know

497
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,200
on the argument of you know maybe where this sort of thing comes from how how they get people

498
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:25,000
to do stuff like this to blow themselves up and do all that that you know is this possible that

499
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,280
this worked I'm I'm just bringing it up for what it's worth and with that I guess that's pretty

500
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:35,960
much it I noticed that you signed off your podcast with something that I'm I very much believe in

501
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,440
myself he said live with passion I first heard that from Tony Robbins but I can't tell you how

502
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:47,880
much I agree with it Adam take care and bye for now yeah man well it's time for me to confess absolutely

503
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:58,920
am I influenced by Tony Robbins I've read his books I've listened to his tapes and I'm talking

504
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:04,280
