Hey, everybody. Welcome to the Daily Source Code episode number 774 as always or at least

34
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,560
has it's been for the past eight weeks brought to you almost directly from the curry

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,320
manner in the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Guilford. Hey, it's the prize nice

36
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,000
scene each other today. I actually had a couple of meetings scheduled in town. They got

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,200
canceled or actually postponed, I should say. And not too bound about it because today once

38
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,000
again protest in and around London as the holliers, let's just call them the truckers,

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,680
our staging a protest rally. So they're driving on the I think it's the A40 which goes

40
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,160
into London. Some of them are actually parking on the A40 and then they're driving through

41
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,880
Westminster and of course they're protesting the fuel prices and they're saying that

42
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,720
the government really needs to do something about this very very quickly. And they're actually

43
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,320
calling for some kind of anti-competitive behavior compared to Europe. And I guess what they're

44
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,760
saying is because you have truckers coming in from from the continent where there's less

45
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:43,360
taxes on fuel that the British truckers just can't compete. And they're saying hey man, even

46
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,160
these one or two pennies a pound, it's making a difference and we can't keep our heads

47
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,960
above water. It's the second time they've done a protest like this. And interestingly enough,

48
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,080
yesterday I was up in a wadford. Remember the last time I was in a wadford when they had

49
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,120
the previous protest is almost timed with my I should probably not go to wadford because

50
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,640
then we know when I go to wadford to visit my friends at newsquest up there, there'll

51
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,800
be another trucker protest within 24 hours. Anyway, I can of course totally understand and I

52
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,400
got to tell you, I don't think I don't think this is going to let up. And man, I don't see

53
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,640
how any of government including the UK government, they can't let up. They can't let

54
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,200
go these billions of pounds at these guys want relief for because the country's broke. You

55
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,000
know, it's like we got no money. And it's kind of the story everywhere across Europe.

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,920
Now the Lisbon Treaty seems to be falling apart because Germany has not ratified the

57
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,520
proposal yet. Of course Ireland has not the United Kingdom as far as I know, the law still

58
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,800
suits still continues. So even though they have royal ascension still no ratification

59
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,400
and now Poland saying, hey, look, if Ireland is not in, we don't even have to ratify

60
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,600
it. Oh, man, that's pissing off the brand new president of the EU, Mr. Sarcosi. He was

61
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,320
ready, man. He was ready for a real six months of pure presidential pleasure. He got his

62
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,480
babe on his side. He's all trim and fit and he was thinking, I'm just going to be the

63
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,080
root of the roost. And now he's got crap. Let's see how he solves that because I think

64
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,720
there's a lot of questions. And it seems to politicians have questions. Oh, gosh, I'll

65
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,160
go into a head on the hand basket in the world. Anyway, plenty to talk about and I'm glad

66
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:25,960
that I have some extra time to talk to you guys. Starting off with a couple of comments.

67
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,800
And this is based upon Monday's Charlie, we talked about the reasoning behind the price

68
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,200
of oil. Actually, let me do a quick little check here on the futures prices of Brent

69
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:45,280
crude. Hold on, I had it all cute up. Here we go. As of, I'll refresh here. So this is

70
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:54,440
as of 824 AM today, August prices. So this is a future. So basically, someone is willing

71
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,840
to pay $141.15 per barrel as of August, 2008. Kind of cool, because you can see the whole

72
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:09,280
chain of these options. And you'll see that February 09 prices 143.37. So obviously whoever

73
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,080
has this out there is expecting that if someone's going to buy it at this price, they're

74
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,080
obviously expecting it to be higher than that. So that seems to be about the highest one.

75
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,960
It's cool. These futures go all the way through, when we have here 1314, all the way

76
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,280
through December 2016, where the future price is still at 139, of course, with eight years of

77
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,560
inflation that may be cheap at that point in time. No, no, it's still trying to feed and find

78
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,240
out more about how the world bank works. And I went back and re-read a confessions of an economic

79
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,800
hitman. John Perkins has a new book out, actually. See, where does it go? It's a history

80
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,640
of the American Empire or something like that, which seems to be pretty good. I've only just started

81
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:56,960
it. And what this guy says is true is just amazing. He's alive. And I hope you guys did

82
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,200
your homework. I hope you checked out that Lindsey Williams video that I have on Curried.com.

83
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,680
It'll blow your mind when you see what the guy has to say. That's where I got a lot of my theory

84
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,760
from. And of course, I expect this some of the U.S. Check-all heads to check in, including some

85
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:17,120
savons. Here's a topic, Rod. Hey, Adam. It's a topic, Rod. I'm here. I'm a topic about gas

86
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,160
network.com. Just listen to Monday's DSC about your theories on world oil prices. And I think

87
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,320
you're close. There's no doubt that there's lots of very powerful people that like the oil market

88
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,760
just the way it is. Yeah, and I would say it's not really, I don't even think it's a few people.

89
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,120
I think in general, it's the whole system has become corrupted by this dependence upon

90
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,000
oil being traded in U.S. dollars and the deficit being financed that way. Because of course,

91
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,600
the deficit is created. Unfortunately, not through a great health care or fantastic social security.

92
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,080
I think the deficit is pretty much created by war. So that's the military industrial complex

93
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,600
that we were forewarned about. Now, $9 trillion of federal debt, that's what the U.S. owes

94
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,120
other countries. That's just a sad state of affairs. And of course, it's for building all kinds of

95
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,160
you know, war, war crap. Most of it is at least I presume. So yeah, it's a lot of people. It's not

96
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,960
just the happy few as far as I'm concerned. Which is why you really can't pin down to one single conspiracy.

97
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,800
But everyone's kind of being on this game. It's just we've been asleep at the wheel. Because

98
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,240
they worked for us. Remember, they're the drivers, but we pay their tickets.

99
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,520
But we're not going to beat those people by installing little plastic devices.

100
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,880
Also SEO, most of the little marketing sites websites.

101
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,400
Tom McRod. I didn't say we're going to beat anyone with that. I mean, I don't think we're going to

102
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,960
beat the big oil companies by propagating biodiesel either, you know, but it's just maybe a way

103
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,320
a personal way to get a little bit of relief. It sounds like he's not a big believer. Our

104
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,160
savanda, Tom McRod here. No, we're going to beat those people by having a better energy source.

105
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,000
That's available to more and more people. All of them, yes.

106
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,320
Iran was a independent nuclear power source. It scares the heck out of the powers that be

107
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:27,040
the establishment that likes the oil market controlled the way it is. That's why they're afraid.

108
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,560
Anyway, there's no doubt in my military mind that we've got to stop this. We've got to pay attention.

109
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,520
And we've got to tell our representatives that we like expanding nuclear power to avoid the

110
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,720
continued addiction to oil. That's all for now. I work for you.

111
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,640
Thank you. Thank you, Tom McRod.

112
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,640
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Sometimes something just may need some form of a revolution. I don't know.

113
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,080
But I mean, like a loud one. Because you know, I don't think we're going to get very far just

114
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,800
by saying, you know, we want a atomic energy. First of all, it's pretty difficult to rally everyone

115
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:16,080
around the atomic energy. I don't know. I'm just stuck on this topic. I wish I could,

116
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,960
you know, the best thing to do is just to propagate the information and tell everyone as much as

117
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,600
as I know about it. In fact, that even seems to be dangerous. I got an email from someone who

118
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,800
shall go unnamed, who says he has it on a reliable source, that somewhere in September is when the

119
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:43,440
war will start involving the United States, Iran, Israel, and Pakistan. Sounds feasible to me.

120
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,520
And if this does happen, please, you know, if we really get any kind of, we get this

121
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,520
kind of watch it. You know, let's just learn. Let's just presume that the 911 truthers are right.

122
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,400
Let's just presume that for a moment. We know what to look out for, right? So we know we want to look

123
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:11,680
out for, let's see, what was Gulf War 1 when the George Bush's dad went into Iraq. It was, oh,

124
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,320
yes, it was kids, yeah, unplugging incubators, killing children and incubators. I think that was the

125
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:29,120
main driver behind, you know, going to war. This guy is a horrible man. Let's go and take his oil.

126
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,640
And then, of course, we know weapons of mass destruction was used next. So what will it be for Iran?

127
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,640
I don't think the weapons of mass destruction thing is really working so now it's like, you know,

128
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,040
they got a nuclear bomb. I think they'll come up with something more innovative. I think they're

129
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,880
still with a couple months left in the presidency. I think they'll come up with something really

130
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,080
good, something that'll just, outrageous about how horrible Iran is. By the way, if you're a

131
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,760
Iranian, would you please call in? Because I'd like to speak to someone from Iran. And I know that,

132
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,600
you know, there's a huge proliferation on the internet. Although the language that is used by the

133
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,800
Iranians is not pretty universally understood by the rest of the world. I'm understood, but I'm

134
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,400
led to believe that they speak English as a second language quite well. And just looking at pictures

135
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,640
and videos and stuff on even on Facebook, you know, I'm seeing like this is like a young thriving

136
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:27,200
population, the 70% of that country is 30 years or younger. When I go bomb him, he's fucking crazy.

137
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,280
We all know what it's about. So let's just be on the watch. Let's keep our eyes wide open.

138
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,440
Anyway, go back to the hydroxy booster. Yeah, of course, you know, yes, there's MLM websites.

139
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,080
But I think the principle is kind of there. And I've spoke to a couple of people who say to me,

140
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,720
oh, we're no, we're going to, how them shit really does work. It does work. And they've built on

141
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,040
themselves. They haven't bought anything from an SEO, LMM, MLM type websites that just tried it out.

142
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:04,080
Now, maybe it's perception or maybe it changes your driving habits. But hey, if it, no matter

143
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:12,400
what it's doing, if it's working right now, 25% reduction in your gasoline usage could be about

144
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,320
a buck a gallon. So I think it's worth the experiment. Some more calls about that.

145
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,480
I do. Don't call a gas gob. Hey, John. Hi, drugs are based. Yeah. Back away, sorry.

146
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,440
Every time it's a little bit of a feel Christ, it's all these sort of gadgets pop up out of the wood

147
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,960
magnets. Yes, you put a current through water. You break it down into hydrogen and oxygen.

148
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,680
Which you can re-combine to get water back. When it's a energy company, let the current.

149
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,640
Well, a whole second. I'm not saying it's it's efficient for the actual energy produced. I'm

150
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,040
saying the efficiency is co and I do believe this is true. I mean, if you can get it right,

151
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,440
it seems apparent to me that the the efficiency is in your pocketbook, not in the the

152
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,160
power output. And I don't want to get into the argument because I've got lots of physicists

153
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,360
or telling telling me it's impossible. It doesn't work. The numbers don't add up. All I know is that

154
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,600
I know people who are spending about $40 or $50 less a month on gas since they installed

155
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:25,760
the hydroxy booster. Again, it's not about putting your entire automobile on hydrogen, but also

156
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,320
that whole idea of on the go hydrogen. I'm still into that. I think this possibility is in it.

157
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,640
Of course, once the engine is combusting and driving, it should output more power to charge your

158
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:44,960
battery or provide an off answer whatever you need to the to the setup. Look, I don't know. I've ordered

159
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,560
one. I'm going to put it on the jag. I don't know what they have I'm talking about, but I will do

160
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,680
a real conclusive study for myself and I'll let you guys in on it, okay? If you're doing it on board

161
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,320
in the car, it's been generated by the engine. There's no such thing as a free lunch. And then you

162
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,800
feel economy gains. What you always get that when you try and you get, you're looking for an

163
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,680
bird to say, come and drive a little lighter wondering whether it's working. That's a few

164
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,360
tank flows, the driving reserves are normal and the economy returns normal. It happens every time

165
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,080
there's a two crisis. It happens in 73. It happens subsequently and it'll probably happen again.

166
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,560
Just walk away. Nothing to it. John, you're telling me that you were aware of hydroxy

167
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,760
boosters in the 70s? How old are you? I was pretty young in the 70s. I wasn't even thinking

168
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,880
about cars, little-own hydroxy boosters, but I'd be curious to know. If anyone who says this won't

169
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,080
work, have you tried it? That's what I'd like to know. And I'd like to hear from some people who've

170
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,720
tried it and like to hear their results. We've got phone numbers for you to call you know,

171
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,760
it's been so long that I've played one of those jingles. I don't even know the, uh, I don't even

172
00:16:51,760 --> 00:17:00,880
know the numbers by heart anymore, hold on. Plus one, 201, 625, 6357. Of course, I could know the

173
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:08,960
jingles plus and 201, 625, 6357. I came and singing anymore. Anyway, if you're calling from

174
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,760
Europe or from the UK, it's plus four four and the plus of course is handy if you put that into

175
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:20,160
your mobile phone so you can dial it from any country without having to do any pre-codes. Plus

176
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:28,640
for 4200, 768, 13753. If you've used a hydroxy booster, let me know. Did it work for you?

177
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,240
Did you get any results? Do you feel stupid? Do you feel really great? I mean, you got to tell me?

178
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,440
I thought I had to say something as well. Anyway, I'm 27, I want to be a accountant,

179
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,640
I don't know, I'll come to me living in London. Keep all the good work. Thanks. Bye.

180
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,000
Hi Adam, it's Matt from Gamesweasel. On this week's show, we review enemy territory quick,

181
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,560
wars on the Xbox 360. I get a quizzical with the new buzz on the PlayStation 3.

182
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,920
The 3G-8 tells us about the new 90-game and you can win special preview copies of Final Fantasy

183
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,360
7 Crisis Core for the PlayStation, portable, complete without books. That's all it gamesweasel.com.

184
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:06,400
I had the latest and nothing to me. I've been trolling. I've been so transparable.

185
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:17,360
I couldn't have seen. I asked if you liked our new wild, drunken comedies.

186
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,120
But were you like as a child? Did you feel the green?

187
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:30,160
But was you made your college major? Did you have enough of the same?

188
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:37,680
You're the little green. You're still waiting for the world. What a win!

189
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:49,040
The music notes it through the air, along the chattering of all the other people there.

190
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:58,880
It wasn't that green. The sound is just too exist. We're all equipped for me and you.

191
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:14,080
That's not true. Yes, I can't turn the world anymore. I don't know. So unique. I know it happens.

192
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:22,720
Every day, when you be fully, you say it's never been that way, never the right.

193
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:30,720
Even besides, I can't see that photo here. I believe it's true.

194
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,480
It's never been that way, it's never been that way.

195
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:44,960
You know, there's a ranking on the Podship Music Network. You can see what's getting the most

196
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,600
play per day, per week, per month, and all time. This was on the charts all of a sudden.

197
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,560
I know I've played it before Andy Stone in the coffee shop. But I like it as obviously a very

198
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,360
beat-less feel to it. Nice for kind of a rainy Wednesday. Even though the temperature's nice

199
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,440
today in the United Kingdom, man, we got some storms going on. It's just outrageous. Especially

200
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,760
over the North Sea or looking at thunderstorms, hail, real, very typical, typical English weather

201
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,360
in a way. Of course, nearing the finals of Wimbledon, which is about the only thing going on in

202
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,800
the news now, it's just boring. Wow. Oh, here's something I want to tell you about.

203
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,600
It actually comes from the Lady Patricia and the Pod daughter, Christina.

204
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,080
Now, those of you living in the United Kingdom will know about this, but I'm so happy to say

205
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,800
that in a way my dream has come true. The whole thought of branding, we were talking about the

206
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:48,400
creating the wrong brand and just avoiding brands all together. Obviously, it's such a hypnotization

207
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,280
that's going on. You have to wear, you have to have the right sneakers, you have to have the right

208
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,160
shirt, the right watch, the right car, et cetera, and I'm like, well, why don't we just have the wrong

209
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,800
stuff? You know, that's much better. And let's have it not come per se from China. Although

210
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,880
that part I don't think actually was successful with this latest venture, but there's a company now,

211
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,080
which has opened up stores in, well, I know there's one in London, and I think they're opening

212
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,040
up all over Europe, and it's called Primark, and I really love this store. And I can just see

213
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:27,120
Brits rolling their eyes. But what they do is they have, now I'm, I'm no fashionista, but my girls

214
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,360
are. And they had, it's like a huge clothing store. You know, it's like clothing. It's, you know,

215
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,080
but everything from, you know, dresses, slacks, shirts, shorts, belts, bags, shoes, you name it,

216
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,280
you know, real apparel type store. And they sell everything, which as far as I can tell, pretty much

217
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,880
at the price for which it should be sold at. Now, of course, it doesn't have a label on it.

218
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,960
It doesn't say, you know, Gucci, doesn't say Ralph Lauren, it doesn't even say,

219
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:00,880
well, it doesn't even say H&M. Although I wouldn't put H&M in a real high-class category.

220
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,120
And it costs next to nothing. And the, and the girls like freaking out, like, look at all this

221
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,320
great stuff we found. And you know, this is like a whole pile of things with bags and shoes and

222
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:19,920
sunglasses and skirts and socks and bikinis for like 60 or 70 pounds. And like, yeah, and I think

223
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,960
these guys at Primark, Primark, or as I've heard women here call it, Primar Shay.

224
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,960
You know, kind of like a tarjay thing. It's Primar Shay. I think they're going to be very,

225
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,040
very successful. Maybe finally we're starting to break this very vicious circle. You know,

226
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,480
now that people are looking at their pocketbooks and saying crap, I don't have any money left

227
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,760
at the end of the month, mainly because of the price of fuel and food. And maybe we're just all

228
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,360
getting over ourselves here. And I'm really liking it. Look at a Primark, or as we say,

229
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,080
Primar Shay, hello, at a Market here. You might remember about two weeks ago I called

230
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:03,720
us for Got Your Flight from UK to runner who was, runner, byboard them. Yes, or

231
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:10,240
a kind of mountain. Anyway, so I recorded a flight with my motorcycle rider, I allowed to

232
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:19,160
backpack then. It's about 36 minutes. You can get it via a

233
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:31,800
nip url.com slash audio flight and nip url is s and i t url.com slash a u d i o flight all one

234
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:38,440
word. Yeah, I would be glad to get your feedback. I also also tested a couple of new

235
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:44,520
recording equipment doing it. So probably quite a lot of quality. Anyway, thanks

236
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,400
yeah, Marcus, absolutely. Now, I did check it out. And if you like the kind of stuff that

237
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,840
we do with the Delta Sheriff from time to time, this is a great sound seeing tour. Actually,

238
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,200
Marcus did a really fantastic job. He really edited this together. He said it all up. He tells

239
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,280
you each step of the way, he'll break in and you know, before you. So it's not really like a beginning

240
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:08,280
to end flight like I've done, but he's really taking you through the steps and I played it on the

241
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,280
speakers here upstairs in the attic and it sounded really nice. Particularly when it turns the

242
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,240
engine off, because it's a it's a sailplane. It's a motorglider. So once he's up at altitude, it turns

243
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,920
that off and it's like, wow, that's a nice, that's a very quiet ride. So you should check it out

244
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,920
if you're new to that kind of stuff. Absolutely, Marcus, I really appreciate you checking in.

245
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,360
One more comment for today. Hi, I'm Susan from Whistland in here.

246
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:37,080
I'm Dr. Veckel in the month. Um, I'm fortunate to have been on BBC News 24, uh, last time

247
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,200
from heart talk. And he sets an interesting thing. He said that a lot about your list of

248
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,960
three things. They agreed with everything. You said so quite rightly. Um, he also talked about

249
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,280
IT cards. And he mentioned the interesting thing. He said that time is positive agreement. We have

250
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:59,000
with the US for data sharing. Any information, the, uh, you take up my collection systems would

251
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,040
be automatically shared with the US government. Yeah, you know, it's, I don't know if you're referring

252
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,120
to this report that came out to with the New York Times uncovered, uh, beginning of the week,

253
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,000
um, where they're apparently that, I mean, the US have already signed on the dotted line from,

254
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,640
from what I understand, I actually spoke to a minister of parliament today, uh, who said as much.

255
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:27,480
And the idea is that there would be, um, you know, a full agreement between the US and the European

256
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,680
Union, um, to really transfer any and all data when requested from either side. Of course,

257
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,160
all of this will keep us safe from terrorists if you surely understand what it's all for. It's

258
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:45,400
very important. We just comply with this and lie down and take it up the ass. Um, but, um, that could

259
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:51,480
include, uh, indeed, uh, all kinds of records. And the EU is, well, and basically, the United States and

260
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,000
the EU are now pretty much on par with phone taps and, and of course, this, uh, this horrible, horrible

261
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,960
bill, uh, which forces US credit card companies and other, uh, online transactional outfits such

262
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:10,040
as eBay and Amazon to hand over all of the transaction details to the government so they can scan

263
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:17,000
it for, um, oh, terrorism, of course. Yes, it's all for your protection. So it has, it's not

264
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,680
done yet. It's not a done deal, but man, we get those ID cards. I mean, is it just me? It feels like

265
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:28,920
we're into the final stage. If there really is such an evil plan as the new world order, then man,

266
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:35,800
we're getting really close to, to the final phase with oil prices up, food prices up, um, inflation

267
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:45,800
up, uh, economy stagnating, all kinds of invasions into our lives, uh, from all different angles

268
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,280
for all different reasons. I mean, the only thing that has to happen, now is martial law. That's all,

269
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,720
I mean, that's the only thing that has to happen and we're done, right? So I don't think it's quite

270
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:02,920
there yet, but certainly something that warrants fighting, and, um, I have spoken to, uh, minister

271
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,000
of European Parliament, Sophie Innitfeld. You might want to check her out, I'll put a link in the

272
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,600
show notes. She's actually suing the US government with the electronic frontier foundation.

273
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,880
She has pretty much the same problem I have when she enters the US, and she did the, you know,

274
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,520
where they stop you and give you secondary screening, but they can't really tell you what it's about,

275
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,280
and they need to do a freedom of information act, which they never respond to. So she's actually

276
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,920
gotten the EFF involved, and we'll see what comes out of it. I doubt very much, uh, but, you know,

277
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,680
she says, look, just tell me what you've gotten the database. How the hell can we start to

278
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,600
exchange information with you? If you don't even know what's in the database or how to get a

279
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,600
perfectly harmless people on person off of the list. So there are people fighting this, and I encourage

280
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,560
you to do the same. And, uh, unfortunately, you know, the only means we have really are

281
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,800
whatever political processes that are at our, uh, at our fingertips. You know, I might give

282
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:03,320
Sophie a call, and an interviewer on the Charlie about this issue. Let me just see how the

283
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,000
plays out. Uh, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a story on her in the Washington post,

284
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,520
and uh, she's Dutch, so I, you know, I have a kind of shorter lines of communication. We speak the same

285
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,080
language, uh, but she's, uh, also very fluid and English. So we'll, uh, maybe we'll give that a try.

286
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,440
Oh, and see what else you got here on your message, man. Um, this is apparently, uh,

287
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,560
according to any pen on, um, TV, um, to do with the, to agreement that we had,

288
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,360
or because we could, do what we had. So, oh, that's interesting. So it might be part of a

289
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:36,920
different agreement, a nuclear agreement, hmm. Yeah, I'll check that out for sure.

290
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,280
Just making a note of that. What do you think of that? Um, I'll also, um, on the news recently,

291
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,280
classic. I think this, uh, you can then just learn some of the

292
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,720
single aspects and says it's flying cars on the horizon. So, uh, they, they may be, uh,

293
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:55,000
it may be here, but it's a quick and, uh, we hope that doesn't see them yet. Um, all

294
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,440
usual stuff, uh, solar and, uh, anything else like that. And then that, they

295
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,400
work for us, right? I don't have any of them because, uh, a lot of people still

296
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,960
learn to realize it. Yeah, don't forget it. Absolutely. I love

297
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,360
Clive Sinclair. He seems like a really cool guy and, uh, and my first computer

298
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:18,040
actually was the Sinclair ZX 80 for those of you nerds out there. That was my very,

299
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,080
very first, uh, Nax, he wasn't the first one. Yeah, it was one of the first computers

300
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:26,840
that I've ever had, um, along with like, um, a big 20 came after that. Anyway,

301
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,000
doesn't matter. Uh, big fan of the guy. I always thought his, uh, you know,

302
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,480
his electric cart or a bicycle thing, uh, never thought that was really appealing.

303
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,920
It looked pretty frightening because he was so tiny and driving and traffic just didn't

304
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,560
look right. And the flying car, but now it's just not going to happen. And this is coming

305
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,960
from a guy who actually will believe in a hydroxy booster, okay? But the flying car is not going

306
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,480
to happen. It, in fact, it already exists. It's called the airplane. Private aviation

307
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,360
certainly is there for anyone who wants a flying car. You know, we already have the flying

308
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,560
parking lots where you can fly your flying car to, you know, you just have to take a different

309
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,280
car from the airport from the flying car parking lot. Do whatever you want to go.

310
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,760
It's just not going to happen, okay? There's too many reasons why it won't. Yeah, it's, it's

311
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:18,280
it's, it's, it's, it's, you know, yes, I totally believe that new engines and electric engines

312
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,680
and new types of engine management, et cetera, that there'll be lots of exciting new flying

313
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,880
aircraft. But it's not going to be for someone who hasn't trained. I mean, it's just not as simple

314
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,320
as, uh, okay, auto navigation zipping me away. Take me wherever I need to go. I mean,

315
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:39,240
you're talking about mother earth, you know, there's conditions that, uh, that warrant all kinds

316
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,240
of adjustments. And it's just not going to be, you know, it's just not going to be done completely

317
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,080
electronically. Certainly not for any type of, uh, affordable price. Just not going to happen.

318
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,320
Even though I know we all love one, wouldn't we? I'm going to play one more song for you

319
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,600
before I get out today. This is brand new, uh, Lisa was brand new to my ears from the pod

320
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:06,280
save music network. Blake Morgan featuring no one less than letting crabots.

321
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:13,720
Now a big fan of all, so to have this pod safe is truly a gift. Why don't you see on the

322
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Charlie seven seven four.

323
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,240
You're one more side. Let's see who the hell is on this line.

324
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:56,520
Can't miss something safe trip from my mind to help me in the meantime.

325
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:09,080
I just want to spend the night back in time

326
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:21,080
and bring the cells to life from my mind to give me a reason for today.

327
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:28,600
Blow it up and drive away. Let it blow, let it come, let it go, go all the way.

328
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:38,840
Here in all the radio, one more side, let's see who the hell is on this line.

329
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,840
Can't miss something safe trip from my mind to help me in the meantime.

330
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:52,840
Now the radio, one more side, let's see who the hell is on this line.

331
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:59,080
Can't miss something safe trip from my mind to help me in the meantime.

332
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:13,080
Can't miss something safe trip from my mind to give me a reason for today.

333
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:29,080
Can't miss something safe trip from my mind to give me a reason for today.

334
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:35,080
Can't miss something safe trip from my mind to give me a reason for today.

335
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,080
Can't miss something safe trip from my mind to give me a reason for today.

336
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:45,080
Can't miss something safe trip from my mind to give me a reason for today.

337
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,080
Can't miss something safe trip from my mind to give me a reason for today.

338
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:55,160
Can't miss something safe trip from my mind to give me a reason for today.

339
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:05,080
Can't miss anything safe trip from my mind to give me a reason for today.

340
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,320
Oh. Now the radio!

341
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,640
I wonder if there are little minny suns and wateride in there?

342
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,360
Can't miss something safe trip from my mind to give me a reason for today.

343
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,040
Let me prove it, why don't you say it is?

344
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,240
Pods, safe.

345
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,120

pah music.mevio.com as well.

351
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,320
Okay. Um, so I'm not quite sure how the rest of the week is going to look

352
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,600
since stuff has been moved around, um,

353
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,120
but if I'm here another day, you know, I'll do another show for you.

354
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,840
And of course, I am going out to San Francisco,

355
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,840
probably by the end of the month.

356
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,120
Excuse me. Oh, and guess what's going to take place?

357
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,120
Oh, yes.

358
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,320
Excuse me. Finally, a full blown

359
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,920
turn it off unplugged jackout

360
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,640
vacation for the curry clan.

361
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,040
That's right, uh, from the 11th, so they'll be next Friday.

362
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,440
We're taking off. We're going to the south of

363
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,240
France to San Rafael, which is somewhere in between

364
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,640
con and central pay and we've got a pad all lined up there.

365
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,240
We're going to have seven days of nothing but, uh,

366
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,480
hopefully sunshine and that over. I'm really hoping for, um,

367
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,440
this is swimming pool. Of course, with the ocean is nearby.

368
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,400
I'm so looking forward to it. And that means that I will be completely

369
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,920
unjacking from the cha cha.

370
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,240
Unless someone wants to take over and do a couple of best

371
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,960
or, um, or any other ideas, which, of course,

372
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,800
I'm completely open to just to keep him's content.
