33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How did they know?

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Such good for you.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Then I'll tear it.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Will your wake up, wake up.

Throw it on the land.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And kill what you can't just to make the profit's rise.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll say you from her.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
From all that you were.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And how do they know?

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What's good for you?

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000

What a hole.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I start to let head.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Then I'll tear it.

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Will your wake up, wake up.

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000

I'll bring your mind to the clover disguise.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Don't wanna hate you.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't wanna blame it all on you.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Out of all shame.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If you don't look home for you too.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If you don't look home for you too.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you don't look home for you too.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Wake up, wake up.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What a hole.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Wake up, wake up.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What a hole.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I start to let head.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Then I'll tear it.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Will your wake up, wake up.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What a hole.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll bring your mind to the clover disguise.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll bring your mind to the clover disguise.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The hole.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It'll be yours.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll bring your mind to the clover disguise.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
From the affluent suburb of Surrey,

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Jonas Kilford in the United Kingdom,

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
everybody, how you doing?

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's Tuesday, I wanted these days when I stopped apologising for

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
missing out on shows, which of course I did again last week.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Man, though it's just no way around it. It's too busy. Have you seen this media today stuff? I've been doing this

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I got to tell you I'm totally

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Vibin on on this video stuff. It's been

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Six years, I think since I was messing around with Final Cut Pro actually

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It was one of the first versions of the Final Cut Pro. We made our reality show on it

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And it's improved quite a bit since then, but just he got it. It's like

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I guess like Photoshop, you know, if you're really in a Photoshop, which I have never really been into

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You know, you just get into it and hours go by before you know it

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And so I'm really trying to come up with the quickest way and I believe me. I've tried everything

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I've tried live to take, but at the end of the day, you're setting up some templates and stuff

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And yeah, just having a kind of a set systemology and workflow

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah, it's a works best and Final Cut Pro and I'm doing all the stuff myself. I'm loving it

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Which means I'm getting closer to coming up with the

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Some alternative programming that I've been thinking about anyway

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So the main thing is I got stacked up because I had to go to the Netherlands on Sunday

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I hadn't told you guys about this. This was a request that came in several weeks ago

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And it wasn't until they backdored it through my wife

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That sounded kind of weird, but

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Essentially the public one of the public broadcasters in Holland

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So that would be equivalent to BBC, I guess they

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
They do an annual top 2000

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Countdown on New Year's Eve

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So not like Dick Clark's New Year's Rock and Eve, but it's in a studio

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And it's, you know, it's a really good atmosphere and they're doing things a little bit differently this year

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Where just before the top 10 or the top 20, whatever it is, they take about an hour and a half

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And they have a smaller setting almost like a living room

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
With nothing but extremely talented people

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And me

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So you won't know most of them, although this one guy Tuan

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I think he's got a record coming out in England pretty soon

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll be sure to play that

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But Candy Dolphor, you might know Candy, of course, famous for her sex playing

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I've known her since she was 14 years old

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I've played with Prince, you know, when Prince says when I want sex I call Candy that Candy

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Also done a lot of stuff with Dave Stewart, of course

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I think it started with Dave Stewart, now they come to think of it

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Tuan, you host a house, another famous, I would say, world famous, Dutch singer

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It was just, it was just wall to wall really talented people

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And the reason they'd asked me to be there is because Madonna, Prince and Michael Jackson are all turning 50

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They were all turned 50 this year and so they wanted me to tell a story about it

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Not normally, I didn't really feel like doing it, but the producer, you know, worked, producers married to a producer that worked with Patricia

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah, I got Shanghai

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So anyway, so I wound up doing stuff in hotel rooms

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
On Final Cut Pro, you dirty bastard, I hear you thinking

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Oops, I didn't want that one

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Here's what I want

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
All right, early in the week

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hey Adam, how you doing?

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm doing good now

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I was just hit that number 151, but before we start, I want to take you back to the last week

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay, this is why

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hi there Adam, this is Barry Apeo, new ring

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
From the answer number 3

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, 19, every three

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Ah, very good

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Excellent

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Ah, it's too bad we missed it, y'all, thanks for putting that

142
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Disappointed in the last week's hit there

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But due to some delays, I couldn't get it to you on time

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But I didn't want you to miss out on it, so

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's why

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This little flashback to last week

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It tests number 150

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Read all the

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
All right, enough time for hit test number 151, so here we go

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay, test

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Intro number 1

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Uh, flash from the pan

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Ah

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Got it, now I can recognize

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Uh, I don't know the name of the song though

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But I intro sometimes you can recognize so easily

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Number 2

158
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Adult education, hall another

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Hell yeah, on a roll

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So definitely two for three, which flash in the pan song was that I can

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And number 3

162
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Back to land

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Back to reality

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Uh, crap, who sings that

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And it's time for the answer

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And this is answer number 1

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Flash in the pan

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Nineteen 85

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Round midnight

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Think

171
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Think

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Uh

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't understand

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Can't help

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Do you promise man

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You don't help me

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You midnight man

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
There you go, midnight man

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Answer number 1

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And hit test number 1

181
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Five, one

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Midnight man, flash and the pan

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Ah, I don't know

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And this is answer number 2

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Adult education

186
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Nineteen 85

187
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And I don't know the name of the song

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But I'm not telling you, go, that's why

189
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't understand

190
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't understand

191
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh yeah

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What the need of the knowledge

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I can't show it

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But I'm not telling you, that's why

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I don't understand

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Oh yeah

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
All in all

198
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
As answer number 2

199
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And this is answer number 3

200
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't know

201
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't understand

202
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't understand

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh, I don't know

204
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
All in all

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Ah, prefer don't know

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh, I don't understand

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And so number three, soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to soul to

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:43,000
soul to soul to soul to soul to soul

209
00:11:43,000 --> 00:12:04,060
in

210
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,940
all the stuff. We're also moving by the way in the midst of all this lady Patricia off to the

211
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:17,020
the Curry Terrace today for flooring. It's going to be a very, very crazy Christmas. We're going

212
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:24,460
to be sitting in boxes or sitting on boxes with maybe some egg nong. That's what I'll do. I got to

213
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:29,980
make up some egg nong. Anyway, there's so much has happened. Obviously since we last spoke and

214
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,860
it always, it just seems to continue. It never ceases. The funniest thing which actually I put

215
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,260
in my video today that is airing on today. If you go to my video to Arkham, you'll see it is

216
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:45,660
the shoe that was thrown at George Bush while he was getting a speech in Iraq. A couple things,

217
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,660
well, actually a speech. It gets a press conference. A couple things that I noticed about that. So

218
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:55,420
first of all, man, GW got some skills when it comes to ducking the boots. I mean, it's like this,

219
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:02,460
guys had shit thrown at his head before and no doubt about it. What did the Iraqi journalist,

220
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,100
I guess, actually say, was he just pissed at the TSA for having to take a shoes off every single

221
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:14,300
frickin' airport in the world or was it something else? Perhaps it's the fact that Iraq has now

222
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:21,260
authorized, I love this, and the United States subsequently has authorized the purchase by Iraq

223
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:28,380
of several billion dollars worth of war equipment. Oh, man, this is the economic hitman in

224
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:34,460
at work. So if you've never read that book, the either confessions of an economic hitman. I've

225
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,780
talked about it many times. You must read that book and you'll see exactly how all of this works

226
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:44,300
and exactly what went down in Iraq. But I thought it would, you know, thought it was kind of interesting.

227
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,380
And the other thing I noticed about that video is so the guy throws one shoe, then he throws

228
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,660
another shoe and only then in the background do you see like secret service guys running through

229
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:59,900
a back entrance? What the hell is going on with that? Do they not screen people? Do they feel that

230
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,980
it's all safe? I found that to be highly interesting. It took at least 30 seconds before anyone

231
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,020
responded and did anything. Actually, the other journalists were doing more than then secret

232
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:18,220
service as far as I could tell was very, very interesting. Financial markets, which I always

233
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,340
keep my eye on for you. I'm sure you've been taking a look at it as well. Of course, up and down,

234
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,260
we're bouncing all over the place mainly because there's so much uncertainty about the

235
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:34,940
the forthcoming bailout of the auto industry. It's getting really kind of nutty because now,

236
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:40,140
apparently the treasury is going to just make a decision whether they should give some money to

237
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:46,700
these guys or not. I mean, what happened to Congress? Is that no longer necessary? And Congress

238
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,660
doesn't have to make any kinds of decisions. Now, Hank Pauls, I could just make that up all by himself.

239
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:59,580
Oh, yeah, because somehow it fits underneath the tarp bailout bill for troubled asset relief

240
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,500
program. How can that have anything to do with the auto industry?

241
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:10,140
Unless you, I guess you count them as three of America's troubled assets? Yeah, sure.

242
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:17,740
And it's horrible, of course, that these companies are going to fail. And I don't think an injection

243
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:23,660
of cash is going to help at all. It's not even injection. It's a loan that they do have to pay back.

244
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,180
You know, just look at the product. That should tell you enough. I wouldn't invest in it.

245
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,140
Warren Buffett's not stepping up to invest. Why not? Well, because probably people who are

246
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,700
are smart about business look at it and say, nah, not a good idea. You know, kind of like the

247
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,260
way banks aren't giving you a mortgage if you're looking for one. Same thing, but oh, no, we'll just let the

248
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,980
former Goldman Sachs CEO who now runs our money and printing presses make that decision.

249
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,020
And of course, in the meantime, the bailout now really has cost American taxpayers because

250
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,780
you will be paying for it in taxes or indirectly through inflation, which is kind of a hidden tax,

251
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:08,540
eight trillion dollars, eight trillion. And the Federal Reserve and the Treasury or the Federal Reserve

252
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:15,180
specifically won't even tell us who they've lent the money to. Go look at the stories. It's on Bloomberg.

253
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,140
And it's all in the show notes of daily source code.com. And most of the stuff, of course, source

254
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:27,020
from the drop, which is a great place to keep up with what's going on. It's drop.io slash daily source

255
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:33,420
code. Let's see who do we have here. Hey, Adam, it's Cory from Minnesota. Hey, Cory, how are you doing?

256
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,820
I'm going to go back. Thanks for talking about this stuff. I love this show. I love, uh,

257
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,620
love, no agenda because I love to hear you go back and forth with John Devore Act. I got to tell

258
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,020
we had a pretty good show this weekend. It was a little bit long. It was like an hour and 45 minutes,

259
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,140
but yeah, we were into it. Um, thank you. Appreciate you listen. Lots of people tuning into

260
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:58,860
Noah agenda. Noah agenda.mevio.com. It's great. Great, great entertainment, great listening. Hey,

261
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,980
I have an idea, or maybe it's a proposal, or maybe it's just, uh, just someone going to throw

262
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,620
out there. Uh, it has to do with dealing with the subject when you're talking to people that

263
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:14,620
don't necessarily know anything about it, um, or are just don't get that we're getting fucked in the

264
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:23,020
ass by, uh, Googleful leads. You know, wait. You got a little, uh, cow ball ring for that.

265
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,980
It's just a little too much for them to fathom in one sitting. You know, it's hard to go into

266
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,420
with them right away. And what I was thinking is, uh, instead of sitting there and, and a lot of

267
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:38,140
us out there can't sit, you know, we can't sit down and explain everything. I mean, there's just too much

268
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:43,020
to go over. I was wondering if there was something we could do like, is there's some way we could

269
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:49,420
set up some sort of a page, um, kind of a, kind of a starter kit, a jumping off point, uh, just something,

270
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,460
you know, a little introduction to, uh, you know, what's going on out there? You know, that's a,

271
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:00,540
that's a good question. And I found that the, well, I'm just kind of searching my own, uh, my own awakening

272
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:06,860
if you will. I found that looking at one of the hundreds, maybe even thousands by now of videos,

273
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:12,940
and of course, all of them have varying degrees of quality and accuracy. But there's so many

274
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:21,740
great videos that really do get into explaining, um, how the world really works, how what I would

275
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:27,660
call the energy elite control us and have enslaved us to their fossil fuel industry of energy,

276
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,700
of course, being the basis of everything. That seems to be the easiest and, and you've probably

277
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,340
know, you know, many, many different ones. If anything, you'll get people to start thinking,

278
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,020
they may not agree with it. They'll call it total hogwash, but still these videos are,

279
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:46,460
now getting so well produced, um, that, uh, it just has an impact. It certainly worked for me.

280
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,020
So really sending someone to a site where there's lots of words, it still doesn't have the same type

281
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:57,420
of impact as, uh, as a, as a well polished documentary online documentary might have. And maybe

282
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,460
even better, just to, you know, um, there's several places we can download them, burn it to a CD.

283
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,740
So it's not even a web experience. All those nuances I find are very, very important. But at the end

284
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,300
of the day, if you want someone just to read mainstream news about what's really happening,

285
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,980
send them to the source code drop. I mean, that's, those are all links to, um,

286
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,780
mainstream or news organizations that are reporting on things really happening. But because it is

287
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:28,460
not repeated over and over and incessantly repeated over and over again, it just doesn't stick.

288
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,740
It doesn't get to the top of the heap, which is normal in this, uh, info overload society. So

289
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:39,340
I would say a combination of that, uh, drop.io slash daily source code, uh, as well as, uh, one of

290
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,900
your favorite movies, depending on the situation, depending on the person, you can also, uh, pick any

291
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:49,020
number of topics that might, uh, that might shake this person up. Uh, I've done it several times,

292
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,700
um, to people who are highly skeptical, uh, but who at least loved me, uh, who are willing to,

293
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,340
willing to watch something and it did work. And it has continued to work. Time and time again.

294
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,860
I mean, it's hard to just send them to your, your site. It's hard to send them to an Alex

295
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:09,020
Jones site without them being just extremely, extremely cynical about it. It just being completely,

296
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,500
you know, I don't even know what the word is. But uh, just shocked. Yeah, and, and also,

297
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,820
send them to Noah agenda because Noah agenda, I think there's, there's enough balance there

298
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:25,660
between John and I that that it actually, that that could work. It kind of depends on the episode though,

299
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:30,700
but, uh, there's something topical going on. It might be interesting for them to listen to it.

300
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,620
It would know agenda. Me vetoed a call. You know, and, or just, it just completely doubt it.

301
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,860
So I was thinking, you know, hey, what if we could all get together, put our heads together,

302
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,980
and come up with something that is, uh, just, you know, what could we throw into this little

303
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,820
starter pack? If they get everybody thinking, you know, like an FAQ kind of a thing,

304
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,300
just something to kind of get them in slowly. So they're not just going to get slammed with all this

305
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,060
information and just being like, oh my god, you know, what's going on? And I don't believe this

306
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:01,740
is crazy and I leave you alone. You guys are freaks, you know, just something to make it easier

307
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,060
to, uh, to believe. And I think that would help everybody. I'm sure there's tons of people out there

308
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:12,620
that could probably use something like this. And frankly, we need it. We need for people,

309
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:17,340
you know, we need it to be easily digested, you know, because there's a lot of people out there that

310
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:22,460
need to know this obviously. And I think it would just really help the cause and, uh, really helped

311
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,860
the wake people up. So anyway, put it in a ramble too much. Yeah, a little bit at the end, uh,

312
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:33,500
the gist of when I'm talking about. And, uh, well, they work for us. Yeah. And, um, that's

313
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:40,780
really easy to, uh, make everybody understand just what that means. Thanks a lot, Adam. And, uh,

314
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,740
hey, I just got to throw one little plug in there. Music. Goat.com. That's where you can find me.

315
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,540
Anyway, yeah, now I may, well, at the end of the day, you know, it's just not easy. You got to work

316
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:56,540
at it. People don't just wake up from years of hypnotization over night. You know, there is no easy path.

317
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,540
You gotta work at it

318
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:56,540

320
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
Baby on your knees

321
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360
There's a friction

322
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
In the kitchen

323
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,360
In the dream

324
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,360
Yeah, I remember

325
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,260
But I know, yeah, I'

326
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Wait, but I know, yeah

327
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,360
But I know, I know, I know, I see

328
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,360
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I see

329
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,360
But I know, yeah, I know, I, I see

330
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,360
He's right in the end

331
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,360
Look, because you're broken

332
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,360
Is this a joke?

333
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,280
So go by something that you can't afford

334
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,120
Because your road, cause your friends is high

335
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,360
You're such a joke

336
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,160
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

337
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,360
That way it's all created

338
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,360
Even with your heart

339
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,160
Isn't it really, really, really?

340
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,720
Isn't it true?

341
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Isn't it?

342
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

343
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Help me make this

344
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Don't make this amazing

345
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,720
I know I'm going to be a lady

346
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,720
I'm going to be so beautiful

347
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,720
It's you, it's you

348
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
It's me, it's me, it's me

349
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,720
No, no, no, no

350
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,720
It's me, it's me

351
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,720
No, no, no, no, no, no

352
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,720
I can't just say you're not

353
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
What is going to be real

354
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,720
I know I'm going to be a lady

355
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,720
Where is my wife?

356
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Where is my wife?

357
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Where is she?

358
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,720
Yeah, you're not being Hollywood

359
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Where's my wife?

360
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
I'm going to be a lady

361
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
I'm going to be a lady

362
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Yeah, I'm going to be a lady

363
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
And I'm going to be a lady

364
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,720
I'm going to be a lady

365
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
My queen Ed Daven

366
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,120
I'm gonna do it.

367
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,460
I'm gonna go now, man.

368
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,560
I'm gonna do it.

369
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
I'm gonna do it.

370
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,560
I'm gonna do it.

371
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,500
There we all be free.

372
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,800
As some disturbing, I'm sitting pretty much in the middle of the news between the United

373
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,680
States and Europe, and I saw something on the news in Amsterdam when I was there, which

374
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,920
I'll get to in a moment.

375
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:57,360
But I think it relates to this piece, which is from Lou Dobbs.

376
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,080
Let me see.

377
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,400
This was uploaded to YouTube October 29th.

378
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,560
Have a listen to this report.

379
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
It's a wrap.

380
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,160
It's a question tonight about an Army combat brigade being trained to deal with civil

381
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,160
disturbances in the United States.

382
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,400
The Posse Comitatis Act of 1878 generally prohibits federal uniform services from carrying

383
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:21,400
out domestic law enforcement duties, except in cases expressly authorized by the Constitution

384
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,800
or an act of Congress.

385
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,400
Now, you'll hear about this thing called the Posse Comitatis Act a lot.

386
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:34,600
Let me just repeat that that the US military may not be deployed to American streets against

387
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:41,000
American civilian citizens unless carrying out domestic law enforcement duties for carrying

388
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,720
out domestic law enforcement duties except in cases expressly authorized by the Constitution

389
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,440
or an act of Congress.

390
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,400
Now, we pretty serious stuff.

391
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,720
That would essentially be an all-out attack.

392
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,160
That's when they can be deployed to carry out domestic law enforcement duties.

393
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,200
But now, listen to what's happening this Christmas season.

394
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,960
Critics say the brigade's training goes against one of the founding principles of our

395
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,680
country, separation of military and civilian government.

396
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,320
Luis Givoni has our report.

397
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,880
They've spent 30 months on the streets of Baghdad.

398
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,320
Now the first brigade combat team of the Army's third infantry division is back in the USA.

399
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,680
The Army times report in quote, they may be called upon to help with civil unrest.

400
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:29,600
And crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios and quote, the question arises

401
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,680
why and isn't that what the National Guard does?

402
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:38,240
Infantry brigade is designed to engage an enemy with maximum amount of this guy is an attorney

403
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,240
Craig Trebilcock, active force and destroy it.

404
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,440
That's not the sort of thing anybody wants to see in the streets of the United States.

405
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,200
Now almost 5,000 strong.

406
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,600
The brigade is based at Fort Stewart Georgia under control of Northern Command, who

407
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,680
tell CNN quote, the primary purpose of this force is to provide help to people in need

408
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:03,120
in the aftermath of a WMD like event in the homeland so that were they called to support

409
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,040
civil authority, those governors or local state jurisdictions that might need our help,

410
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,200
but they would be responsive and capable in the aftermath of an event like this.

411
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
All right.

412
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:21,160
So, and this is coming from Colonel Michael Boatner, who is interesting title, future operations

413
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,160
Northern Command.

414
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,840
Oh, something that will happen in the future.

415
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:33,000
So they're training and they're going to be setting up DUI traffic stops, which to me just

416
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,280
seems like it's totally wrong.

417
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,840
Now at the same time, and this is why I'm relating, so the question you got to ask

418
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,880
there is, you know, they're training, do they expect something, do they know that we

419
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,400
don't know, now over to the Netherlands.

420
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,520
I'm watching the news, and this is big bruhaha, that the government had ordered the

421
00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:04,560
production and sale of emergency packs, and the reason why I was in new stories because

422
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,840
they did this huge PR and advertising campaign.

423
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,720
They bought all this ad space, but the packs weren't actually in the stores yet.

424
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,080
Now, so they was some governmental screw up, yeah, go figure.

425
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,120
But then, you know, they're showing these packs, and these packs are, first of all, sponsored

426
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,560
by Varkta batteries, which if you're in any emergency, I hope I don't have to rely on Varkta

427
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,960
batteries, batteries, as we say in the UK.

428
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:38,240
You know, it was a time of candles, it was like, and they're literally saying, well, just

429
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,720
in case every household should have one of these, and so they did this big push, they

430
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,840
didn't wait for the supply chain to be ready to actually sell these things in stores.

431
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,040
What do they know that we don't?

432
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,760
And by the way, what is the piece of rope in there for?

433
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,080
That's what I'd like to know.

434
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,040
Is that the hang yourself?

435
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,280
I want to probe it.

436
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:11,040
Hi Adam, it's Matt from Games Weasel on this week's show, I review Lococo 2 on the PSP,

All right, the chuckle head's getting ready to crank it up, I will just pretend it's a little bit

441
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
of a footballer crying.

442
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
The fight's on.

And when we were good, just close your eyes

446
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:13,280
So when we are bad, we'll scare your mind

447
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,280
We're not as light till we're tired

448
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:23,280
Telling things, we're not as light

449
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:28,280
Still around the world, telling you about shit

450
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,280
We said the water's a shadow here

451
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,280
That you're the water's a shadow here

452
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,280
But you're the water's a shadow here

453
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,280
That you're the million shining stars

454
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,280
That you're shining star, we're not as light

455
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,280
Still around the world, telling you about shit

456
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,280
We're not as light till we're tired

Still around the world, telling you about shit

459
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,280

We're not as light, still around the world, telling you about shit

461
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,280

Yeah, we're not as light, we're not as light

463
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Come on, come on

464
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,280
Say hello to my little friend, Adam Kerry

465
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
I'm a really source code

466
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,280
Eduardo, thank you my friend

467
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Excellent

468
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Yeah, fight song

469
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
Yeah, oh, one more thing I wanted to mention about my travels

470
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,280
On the way back, going through simple airport

471
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
Amsterdam International

472
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:46,280
They now have, so there's the H.P.R which is where all the easy jets fly from

473
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,280
I couldn't fly myself by the way because we've got horrible weather here in the UK

474
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,280
We've got missed down to the ground

475
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,280
That went like one in the afternoon

476
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
So I wasn't taking any risk

477
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,280
I just like let me just take the easy jets

478
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
Love the way easy jet works

479
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,280
By the way better than KLM British Airways

480
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,280
When it comes to short haul

481
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Better than anything, I just love the way those guys operate

482
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,280
Anyway, on the way back, you go through the H.P.R you have to go through

483
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,280
They have their own security and they have two lines

484
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,280
One line is the old fashioned x-ray with the metal detectors

485
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,280
The other line is oh yes, it's the new photo scanning device

486
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,280
And this thing is oh man, actually by accident I got on that line

487
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,280
Actually got out of that line

488
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
This is the one if you haven't seen the pictures before

489
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,280
It's where they x-ray you

490
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,280
And they can actually see through your clothing

491
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,280
And see if you know what you have in your pockets or what you're wearing

492
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Or should you have anything hidden on your body

493
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
And it's so degrading

494
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,280
You have to I was looking at people you have to get in and then put your hands up

495
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,280
All the way if the stretch your hands up while they take this picture of you

496
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,280
And you know and this people looking at you like basically naked

497
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,280
And I find this the perfect opportunity to pester my wife

498
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Because she's the one that says oh you know these cameras

499
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,280
I don't mind about the CCTV cameras because you know hey

500
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Wait until your daughter's missing you know

501
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Then you'll be happy they have CCTV cameras

502
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Yeah darling but at the end of the day you know where does it stop

503
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,280
Well if you have I love this line if you have nothing to hide

504
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,280
If you haven't then you have nothing to worry about

505
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,280
So I said to her yes, I say hey man they got they got that newfangled photo x-ray

506
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,280
Where you know because I've shown her the pictures before

507
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,280
And I remember saying oh my gosh oh my

508
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,280
And she said oh what do you mean so now you have to go through that photo thing

509
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
Yeah but I don't know I go through the other one

510
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,280
Chip it eventually they'll have both don't you understand that

511
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,280
She says well I don't like that

512
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,280
I said oh what do you mean if you have nothing to hide

513
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,280
Then what do you have to worry about

514
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,280
But a Bing

515
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,280
Oh it's nasty it's just

516
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,280
I believe when they have that fully

517
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,280
Implemented I think I'm just going to have to ask for a hand search

518
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,280
There surely there must be some legal ground that I can go against that

519
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,280
Oh I feel so violated

520
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,280
You're looking at me naked dude

521
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,280
And as we've established many times before

522
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,280
Naked guys just not a good look

523
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,280
In general

524
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,280
Adam Curry this is Mark from pflying.com

525
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,280
Mark is thankful from the letter pflying.com

526
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,280
I just want to thank you

527
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,280
So much about your show and what you do in your awakening and your message

528
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:39,280
I listened to your show like twice at least twice each time now days because it's just filled with so much great information

529
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,280
You always mentioned about show length

530
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,280
I really would love three hours shows

531
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,280
If you could do three hours shows that would be amazing

532
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,280
If that's all I did I could certainly do three hours shows

533
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,280
I mean that's the reason why I skip them you know

534
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,280
I do this because I really really really enjoyed and I want to give you guys a good experience

535
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,280
I don't want to put out crap just because I have the word daily in the title of the show

536
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,280
I just don't

537
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:10,280
So you know if I if I know that it's it's only going to be half a show because I can't prep properly or

538
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
I'm not feeling right or I'm going to be stressed for time

539
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,280
I just don't do it so and also I really don't pay attention to the clock

540
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,280
I just keep going until I feel like I'm done

541
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,280
Which is the beauty of this

542
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,280
Let's just call it podcasting because that's what the audio stuff still is as far as I'm concerned

543
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,280
The video stuff that I'm working on is going to be different

544
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
We won't call it podcasting we'll call it

545
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,280
We'll call it a revolution

546
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,280
I could even do six hours shows I would follow you

547
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,280
I'm trying to have six hours in your day though

548
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,280
Dude I'm working 18 I just have to spend them on other things

549
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,280
Unfortunately

550
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,280
But I would have wanted to thank you most about is the awakening

551
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,280
And because you without you

552
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,280
I would not be to the point where I am now

553
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,280
I would be believing that

554
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,280
To a kind of took down the Twin Towers

555
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:05,280
And I would be believing that we need this auto bailout

556
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:13,280
I would I would believe all this crap that our government has just screwed us over with

557
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,280
There is nothing that I can do at all

558
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:22,280
That I can pay you back for what you have done back to me

559
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Oh no no no no no never ever ever ever

560
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,280
No no this show was made by you you guys make it you put it together you source it

561
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,280
Almost in its entirety

562
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,280
I'm just kind of the the guy in the middle taking up all the pieces putting together

563
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,280
Spinning it back out no thank you

564
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,280
But having said that next time you're in San Francisco let me know dinner's on me

565
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,280
I'll take you anywhere even though I'm a poor bastard

566
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,280
Oh not a bastard but poor

567
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,280
Anyway, I love you very much

568
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,280
I love you dearly

569
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,280
And of course no homo

570
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,280
Other than that don't know what else to say

571
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,280
Love you show

572
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,280

pflying.com

576
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
All right

577
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,280
Thanks man

578
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,280
I appreciate

579
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,280
There's no money

580
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,280
There's no possessions

581
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,280
Only obsession

582
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,280
I don't need that shit

583
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
Take my money

584
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,280
Take my obsession

585
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:51,280
I just want to be heard

586
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,280
Now that you're all my words

587
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,280
Come into a date man

588
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
Tell no what you heard

589
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,280
It's about a revolution

590
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,280
You don't have any desire

591
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,280
To the final conclusion

592
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Let's do an obsession

593
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,280
Come a race, kick your left and put a knife on me

594
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
Let's say it's a market for stress

595
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,280
You're mistaken to this system

596
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,280
Why can't you answer to me

597
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,280
For that shit you don't mean

598
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,280
If you bet the world is based on me

599
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,280
Step back and see

600
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,280
Stop thinking about yourself

601
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
Stop thinking about

602
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,280
There's no money

603
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,280
There's no possession

604
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Only obsession

605
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,280
I don't need that shit

606
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,280
Take my money

607
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,280
Take my obsession

608
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,280
Take my obsession

609
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,280
I don't need that everything is nothing

610
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,280
Everything is nothing

611
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,280
This reality is really just a fucked up dream

612
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,280
With the flesh and the blood

613
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
Let you call your son

614
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,280
Step in this eye now

615
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
It's a big record

616
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
Take your money

617
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Put it up and back in this world

618
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,280

Take it up

00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,280
You don't need that shit

00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
There's no money

626
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,280
There's no possession

627
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,280
Only obsession

628
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,280
I don't need that shit

629
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,280
Take my money

630
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,280

Take my obsession

I don't need that shit

633
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,280
Money

634
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,280
Posing shit

635
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,280
I don't need that shit

636
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,280
Take your son

637
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,280
Take your son

638
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
Take your clothes

639
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,280
Come your hand

640
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,280
Come in

641
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,280
You just can't win

642
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,280
Just can't win

643
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,280
And everything's your fault

644
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,280
Only you

645
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,280
Take my money

646
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
Take my possession

647
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,280
Take my possession

648
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,280

You don't need that shit

Money

653
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,280
Posing shit

654
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,280
I don't need that shit

655
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,280
Is it just me or is it hard rocker today?

656
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
I think we can establish that

657
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
Pop a roach

658
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,280
Two angels and insects

659
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,280
Daily source code

660
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,280
Episode 8

661
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,280
One

662
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,280
One

663
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,280
Actually I had the game today

664
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,280
I see it's only 130

665
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,280
I've done just about everything I've got to do

666
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,280
I do want to mention sponsors of the daily source code

667
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,280
Because in these economic times

668
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,280
These are the perfect types of ads

669
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,280
You want to hear about because they're actually products that you want to buy

670
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,280
I'm sure you're going to use these companies or something similar

671
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,280
If you don't already

672
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,280
And we're all looking for a good deal these days

673
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,280
And you just can't get these products

674
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,280
Any cheaper anywhere

675
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,280
Particularly online

676
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,280
We have the best offering

677
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,280
We go out and negotiate with these companies

678
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,280
So that we can give the audience members a great discount

679
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,280
And producers of great programming

680
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,280
Participate in each sale

681
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,280
So let me just run down because it's so much

682
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,280
First of all, eHarmony, this thing

683
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,280
I've never used the dating site obviously

684
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,280
It've been married for over 20 years

685
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,280
But I hear a lot, I really do know

686
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,280
Actually I know a lot of people who have met each other online

687
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,280
And they've had very successful relationships

688
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,280
And they continue to be successful

689
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,280
Of course, I'm sure there's a regular ratio

690
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,280
There of relationships that don't work out

691
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,280
But it's not free to find someone online

692
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,280
In the proper environment

693
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,280
You've got all kinds of

694
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,280
Basically sites that are set up to be for hookers, I guess

695
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,280
Was it adult friend finder

696
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,280
That's my favorite

697
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,280
But eHarmony.com has a great reputation

698
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,280
You know what they do

699
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,280

Sharper image, you know

723
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,280
If a mall didn't have a Sharper image

724
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,280

None of them do anymore

Now this showed up on the drop

743
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,280
And I'm like

744
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,280
Yeah

745
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,280
I kind of dig that

746
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,280
Because I am in love with the 80s

747
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,280
So the song is about

748
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,280
Listen to the lyrics

749
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,280
I think you'll enjoy it

750
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,280
So it was Jeremy in 1983

751
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,280
And as Ocean Pacific team

752
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,280
We got a bloody knee

753
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,280
On a skateboard

754
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,280
In the half-pipe

755
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,280
In the backyard

756
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,280
That Tuesday night

757
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,280
And I'm only gonna kiss my left ear

758
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,280
And I can't work in on this podcast

759
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,280
All summer long

760
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,280
And my favorite bit

761
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,280
All these beats

762
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,280
And I'm gonna wear a pink touch

763
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,280
To the floor

764
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,280
I'm trying to gloss through the first four window

765
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,280
He's gotten fast

766
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,280
Cause I never did a thing so

767
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,280
And I look up to my big

768
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,280
Well cause in the 80s

769
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,280
All the ladies

770
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,280
Grab this hand and cut in like go

771
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,280
And I'm only gonna kiss my left ear

772
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,280
And I can't work in on this podcast

773
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,280
All summer long

774
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,280
And my favorite bit

775
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,280
All these beats

776
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,280
And I'm gonna wear a pink touch

777
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,280
To the floor

778
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,280
I'm trying to gloss through the first window

779
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,280
He's gotten fast

780
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,280
Cause in the half-pipe

781
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,280
And I'm only gonna kiss my left ear

782
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,280
He's gotten fast

783
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,280
I'm trying to gloss through the first window

784
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,280
I'm trying to gloss through the first window

785
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,280
He's gotten fast

786
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,280
Cause in the 80s

787
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,280
All these beats

788
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,280
And I'm only gonna kiss my left ear

789
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,280
When you're the president

790
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,280
All the breakfast club

791
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,280
And you're the hesitant

792
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,280
To fall in love

793
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,280
To fall in love

794
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,280
To fall in love

795
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,280
To fall in love

796
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,280
For ladies

797
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:50,280
Diamonds

798
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,280
I am from Canada

799
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,280
I'm playing thoughts to the floor

800
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,280
Without a year

801
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:02,280
Who could possibly go wrong

802
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:11,280
You're not where, I'll take my feet off your head

803
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,280
Cause you're feeling way too far in love

804
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:54,280
Yeah, I love with the 80s. I've got to mention there was one other guest on that show I did in Amsterdam, Ruby Wax

805
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,280
Who now apparently is doing a Ruby Wax show in the Netherlands as well

806
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,280
She's kind of franchising herself

807
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,280
But it was interesting because you know when people have been in Amsterdam

808
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,280
But in particular for a while at least out of the country she lives in the UK

809
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,280
I don't think she does much in the States anymore at all

810
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,280
You know then there's always a little bit more vocal and think that no one will ever hear what she's saying

811
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,280
And I could tell you know she's like, I don't do this damn promotional thing

812
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,280
I'll go on there, I'll talk some crap and she was talking about her vagina within 30 seconds

813
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,280
I mean it was pretty, pretty wrang, but funny, got to admit very funny

814
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,280
But she started off by saying, fascist Britain, you know this is a horrible

815
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,280
And she kept saying fascist fascist Britain

816
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,280
Which of course I have to agree with her

817
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,280
And she was relating that to not being able to say anything anymore

818
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,280
Because everything is so politically correct

819
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,280
And then she relayed the Russell Brand Jonathan Ross story poorly

820
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:59,280
I might not, if you can't just explain that in 30 seconds you kind of got to know a little bit of the background

821
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,280
And I thought to myself, wow you know big mouth, Ruby

822
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,280
Why don't you say that over here with your big mouth

823
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,280
Which I don't think she will be doing any time soon

824
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,280
Alright, quick rundown of the drop before we wrap it up for today

825
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,280
Let me see what we've got

826
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,280
Oh and the UK and other dance controversy, strictly come dancing

827
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,280
This is dancing with the stars here in the UK

828
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,280
Oh I heard about this, I didn't see it because it happened Saturday

829
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,280
But apparently this is like banana republic

830
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,280
I can't believe people, you know so

831
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,280
So you already know that the guy who really couldn't dance

832
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,280
But it was very entertaining John Sergeant got thrown off the show

833
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,280
Yeah, he resigned or left or whatever

834
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,280
So they covered that one up

835
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,280
And not that this matters in anyone's life

836
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,280
It's just to show you how complacent the public is

837
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,280
When you're being screwed right before you're very eyes

838
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,280
Or what we actually complain about is opposed to the real crimes that are going down

839
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,280
So now what happened last Saturday is no one got voted off

840
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,280
All three couples went through to the next round the reason why

841
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,280
It was kind of complicated, let me see

842
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,280
I'll read it to you

843
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,280
The problems encountered on Saturday show occurred when there was a tie between dancers

844
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:18,280
Lisa Snowden and Rachel Stephens following the judges scoring

845
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,280
Okay, so the first was the judges scoring then the audience gets to vote

846
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,280
Because of the way the points were then awarded

847
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,280
Actor Chambers and Partner Camilla Dalarib

848
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,280
Could not have been saved from the dance off

849
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,280
Regardless of how many public votes he had received

850
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,280
And that was considered to be unfair by the show's producers

851
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,280
Unfair

852
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,280
So obviously that's you know there's something going on there

853
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,280
Just like the the X factor the UK version had their finals

854
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,280
They're big finale on

855
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,280
I guess that was was it Saturday night?

856
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,280
Yeah, I think it was Saturday night

857
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,280
And see had three three finalists

858
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,280
You had a group called JLS

859
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,280
You had some young kid

860
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,280
It was kind of cute but very young like 15 years old or whatever

861
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,280
And you had like another with Leona Lewis like clone

862
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:11,280
And so they got to sing with the superstar of the three sets they each did

863
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,280
And so the kid sang with a crap

864
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,280
I don't remember I don't remember who he sang with

865
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:22,280
The group sang with boys on and the girls sang with Beyonce

866
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,280
Hello Beyonce a duet with Beyonce

867
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,280
Yeah, do you think that that would be a shoe in for the winner?

868
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,280
I mean come on

869
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,280
And then at this BBC thing

870
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,280
1800 people complained

871
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,280
They felt they were ripped off

872
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,280
Hey, I got news for you

873
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,280
You're getting really ripped off by your government

874
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,280
For hundreds of billions

875
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,280
If not truly

876
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,280
And all people please wake up

877
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,280
Let's see what else we have on the on the drop for today

878
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,280
I'm more about censorship in Australia

879
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,280
Gosh man

880
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,280
And they in the UK they just announced that as well

881
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,280
That they're going ahead

882
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,280
British telecom is going to install that form thing

883
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,280
P-H-O-R-M, pop a hotel Oscar Romeo, Mike form which is

884
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,280
Head-end ISP based filtering and insertion of advertising

885
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,280
It's supposed to be opt-in but

886
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,280
Well, we'll have to see

887
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,280
Have to see what happens with that

888
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,280
I'm getting a BT pipe

889
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,280
Obama still me it's stimulus could reach one trillion dollars

890
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,280
Hmm

Paralyzes 12 year old girl yet no kidding

00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,280
From the waist down by a mystery illness

895
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,280
No mystery to the chuckleheads

896
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:48,280
A mystery illness that came on 30 minutes after she was given the new anti cervical cancer jab

897
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,280
Oh, yes

898
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,280
Ashley Cave suffered

899
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,280
Suffered dizziness and headaches

900
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:59,280
Soon after the vaccination under school and then deteriorated rapidly collapsing several times over the following days

901
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,280
A week later she was admitted to hospital after losing all strength in her legs

902
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,280
And two months later there's been no improvement

903
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,280
Horrible

904
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,280
Ah, this is so horrible

905
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,280
Please don't just inject your kids with anything

906
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,280
Do a little bit of research

907
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,280
Please please please

908
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,280

Of course, let me just check the second page

Numerismatic trade

916
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,280
I don't even want to look at that

917
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,280
I can't even pronounce the word while I look at the story

918
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,280
Food banks turn to farmers fishermen and grocers as manufacturers have less surplus to give

919
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:54,280
Oh, let's see, that's a Yahoo story from associated press

920
00:54:54,280 --> 00:55:00,280
California commercial fishing boats donated 260 pounds of rockfish this month

921
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,280
Food banks running out of food

922
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,280
There's no joke

923
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,280
California running out of money

924
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,280
Peels court case brought in at freedom

925
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,280

Boy, oh boy

927
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,280
And of course, and I did mention this on no agenda

928
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,280
Lisbon Treaty is pretty much adopted now

929
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,280
As the commissioners were essentially handed a bribe by saying, you know what?

930
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:36,280
If we continue to ram through this Lisbon Treaty, which is all legalese to further the agenda of one world government

931
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:42,280
And as far as I'm concerned, pretty much set up and orchestrated for the financial new world order

932
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,280
And make no mistake, they're calling it that openly

933
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,280
This is not a, you know, I'm allowed to say this now

934
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,280
Looking at time mags in here all of these links to be found in the show notes

There it is, that's a title of the article

938
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:08,280
With him, President elect Barack Obama with his national security team at the news conference in Chicago

939
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,280
The new world order

940
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,280
It's no joke, it's here

941
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,280
And you may think it's great, but I prefer to have some kind of sovereignty across nations

942
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,280
I kind of like different cultures

943
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,280
You know what, it just kind of makes me feel good

944
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,280
All right, everybody, time to get out of here

945
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,280
One more song

00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:33,280
To take you into the rest of the week, and I hope to do another show

947
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,280

Right, right, right, right, right

When I was here, I played it hard, fast, night, and everything

00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,280
Walk the way, walk the way, walk the day

I'm lazy, coming, easy, coming, easy, coming away
