1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, and the next generation radio

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:18,440
content in my ears.

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,840
And now the man willing to march on DC all the way from the UK, it's Adam Curry and the

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,500
DSC 723.

5
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,840
I think that's what I did, drink out and buy me

6
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,840
When am I on the road?

7
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,840
Love, love, hate, hate

8
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,440
When am I on the road?

9
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,840
Love, love, hate, hate, hate, hate

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,840
Everything, we'll never run between

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,840
Those are the my interests, need, affordability

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,840
And the war has took us by, I'm the world that has built us in time

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Set the head of heart, take it from major heart

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,840
Can't I do, girls to get through to you?

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,840
I can't tell that you, crazy

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,500
The standard here, about what's the normal

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,840
This, you tell me is, you tell me I'm going without your help

18
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,840
Add some๑wwSh, get some gold

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,840
No, if you're me, if you're me, believe me

20
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Okay see

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
Okay see

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Okay see

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Okay see

24
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,840
Yes, see

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,840
I got my bubble came out

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,840
I can't be vision is all

27
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,240
I got the violence in hand if I'm too real is all

28
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,240
I love this great nation

29
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,640
I love this great nation

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,640
I got my fish, I got my hair, I got so far away

31
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,640
This dance for me, you see it's in the club

32
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Really like to feel nice

33
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,640
You see it's on the floor

34
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,640
You'll be watching all night, we need a look about it

35
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Oh, sit down

36
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,640
Boy, you turn me inside

37
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,640
And round me round

38
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,640
Oh, sit down

39
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,640
Boy, you turn me inside

40
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,640
And round, round

41
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,640
Round, upside down, you turn me

42
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,640
You give a love instinctively

43
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Round and round, you turn me

44
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,640
I say to me, you respect for me

45
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,640
I'm upside down, you turn me

46
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,640
And you give a love instinctively

47
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,640
Round and round, you turn me

48
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Say to me, you respect for me

49
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
I got the problem, you know

50
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,640
I got the problem, you know

51
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,640
I got my fish, I got your hope

52
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,640
I got my fish, I got my fish

53
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,640
I got my violence in hand if I'm too real is all

54
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
I got the problem, you know

55
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Isn't it so easy to teach?

56
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
I got my problems, you know

57
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,680
I got the intuition

58
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,640
You're so holy, I got matter

59
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
I got the demon all the time

60
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
I asked you just come home

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
I got my violence in hand if I'm too real

62
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,400
I got my violence in hand if you're being lost

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,640
I got the idea

64
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
I got it, you turned me inside

65
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
And round, you turn me inside

66
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,640
Man, all's as good as this

67
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
I stradion, ageal

68
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,640
I'm upside down

69
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Mm, ah

70
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,280
Come on

71
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:48,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

72
00:04:48,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh,

73
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,780
Françaisiantly

74
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,000
THEY ARE H mio

75
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,160
Dear god!

76
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,040
DJ Lobster Bus kicks it off

77
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,240
With a hood

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,480
What is he saying here in his show notes?

79
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,840
Not since you were saved for Africa

80
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,320
So I had such a collection of mega stars

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,200
nuggets been assembled for musical cars

82
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,760
Michael Jackson, Paul McCartney, Rihanna, Nellie Frutato,

83
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,560
nine-inch nails, Mary J. Blides, Dan Ross, Rick James,

84
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,800
and the temptations.

85
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,760
Hick an off-dirty source code episode number 723.

86
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,600
Everybody how you doing?

87
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,760
Late in getting the show started again today, because I got some goodies

88
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,120
came in and I had to hook him up and configure him.

89
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,520
And of course, that screwed up just about everything.

90
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,840
You know, I've been working on the ultimate set up

91
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,000
to have the, like this ending here.

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,600
I've got my fist, I've got my pair, I've got some followers.

93
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,480
You know, yeah, working on, uh,

94
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,960
working on setting up the ultimate all-in-one studio for portability.

95
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,200
And I told you that I'm using Ableton Live.

96
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,400
I'm using soundbite as a cart rack, but Ableton Live

97
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,600
because of the low latency factor, because of, um,

98
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,160
you know, the power of the MacBook Pro, essentially.

99
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,920
It all handles it so I can listen to my voice and real-time processing.

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And I told you I was really getting into this MIDI stuff using a MIDI controller

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,360
to control the software.

102
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,400
And so I got a, um, a beautiful, um, just in love with this device already.

103
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,000
A beautiful little, little MIDI control, um, well, they call the control surface.

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,600
But I think this is a control device.

105
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,840
It's, um, from Thader Fox.

106
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,200
How you can find them at Thader Fox.de.

107
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,240
And essentially, it's a, it's a little mixer.

108
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,160
It fits almost on the palm of your hand.

109
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,760
It's, uh, it's shaped just right.

110
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,880
I'm going to put a link in the show notes.

111
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,000
You got to see this thing.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,120
It's shaped just right.

113
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,320
It has nice little angles.

114
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,160
So you can, you know, so the, the way you'd expect a mixer to be,

115
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,800
it has, uh, one, two, three, four, six channels.

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
It has a cross-fader, which I won't use.

117
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
And it also has a number of color-coded buttons.

118
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,720
So I can use those to fire up, uh, different, uh, sound effects or songs

119
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,080
within Ableton Live.

120
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,440
Really loving it.

121
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,840
But of course, I had to configure a new MIDI interface.

122
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,160
And I got a, a little, uh, what is this, uh, an Ederol MIDI interface.

123
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,640
I did a little geeky here, but folks who give a shit, uh, the UM-1 EX.

124
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,240
Uh, so essentially, there's just one wire, uh, going out of this fader Fox into my computer.

125
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,360
I've got the headphones plugged in.

126
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,440
Got the microphone plugged in and I'm done.

127
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,240
And see now when I move this little fader here, kind of, uh,

128
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,160
here, I'll move this up and down and, uh, controls the volume.

129
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,800
And I can see the, uh, the fader indicator on the screen moving.

130
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,880
What was really weird is when you start to configure MIDI devices and you're novice like myself,

131
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,600
um, you know, you have to teach the MIDI device, what controls it's going to handle.

132
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,480
And everything you add to it essentially adds up to the processor, doing more work,

133
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,240
both with MIDI, but also with audio.

134
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,240
And if you have another, uh, MIDI device or interface that, uh, that isn't attached.

135
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,480
It might be looking for that and it could, anything.

136
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,040
All of these different moves can essentially raise your, uh, your processor speed.

137
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,920
And then able to live starts to crap out and so yeah.

138
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,600
And I hunt. What's that?

139
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,320
Oh, thank you.

140
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,560
Peanut butter.

141
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,760
Yeah. Thank you.

142
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,480
Yeah, peanut butter sandwich. Thank you.

143
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,440
Um, oh, no, I should probably lower this threshold a little bit.

144
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,360
That was the lady Patricia who just walked in with some nice,

145
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,560
set peanut butter sandwiches.

146
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,600
Love it. Hey, happy Valentine's Day. By the way, if you're listening to the show on February the 14th,

147
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,440
don't forget his Valentine's Day. There's something you should be doing.

148
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,640
Uh, I spent this morning of Valentine's Day, um, at the dentist.

149
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,680
Man, the older I get, the more this should just starts the fall apart.

150
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,840
I hate it. Anyway, so it's not entirely configured properly. And I've, you know, it was just getting so late

151
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,280
that I figured I just got to get going. Maybe I'll be able to make the show a little bit shorter today.

152
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,440
Just because I don't want to be messing around. But you guys are in effect kind of guinea pigs

153
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,440
for this episode 723 of the Charlie, which of course is coming to you from the curry manner and the

154
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,800
affluent suburb of Surinone is gilford. Crap weather out today. It's, uh, we've got to overcast

155
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,280
guys. It's going to stay. This is what came in from continental Europe. They had that weather yesterday.

156
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,800
And I did do about it. Anyway, good day to be inside playing around with some toys, huh?

157
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:04,120
Yeah. I had them this is Stephen Boston. I did do demographic survey on the website and I found out that

158
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,320
there is no option for zero kids. So thanks to you. I now have one kid and I hope that you're helping

159
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,000
to pay child support on that. So I'm male 41 on a teacher. So I guess you call that middle income.

160
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,840
And, uh, let's see, I have great hair. I really hope I win and I love you, meet it.

161
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,840
All right. Then, oh, well, thank you. I'm sorry about that. I fixed that by the way. That should be

162
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,160
working now. It was kind of dumb. Everyone had to have at least one child on the survey. You should

163
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,480
take a look at it. It's very interesting. Still, I'd have to say predominantly a male audience, but

164
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,920
a couple of very interesting female listeners in there. And of course, that's the only reason I did the

165
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:45,560
whole damn survey. You know, Adam, Nathan Centaroza, um, 27 today, uh, male obviously, uh,

166
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:52,520
Mac user folder, but until, um, whether they're demographic, you want nothing. Get to it.

167
00:10:52,520 --> 00:11:00,280
Uh, 6.6. Whoa. Um, libertarian. Anyway, I was trying to work with Podshow, subscribe to

168
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:07,480
your op-salt show and I can't find a way to subscribe to it in iTunes. Um, Podshow seems to be

169
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:16,600
all self-contained and I can't find any fucking feet. Um, so, uh, well, um, love you, no homo, uh,

170
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,160
great hair, hope you win. Um, whatever. I hope you want.

171
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:27,880
Emma, bye, bye, bye, bye. Dude, I hate it when people don't look. If you go to op-salt.podshow.com

172
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,960
right there on the home page, you'll see there's an RSS link. And of course, if you click on any of the

173
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,440
episodes, you'll see RSS links, links for iTunes, links and their icons. It looks like an icon, uh,

174
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:45,800
for iTunes. It's not that hard to recognize. But yes, in V3 in the new version of Podshow, which, uh,

175
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,800
I think we're going into close beta in next week or two. It seems to be moved along quite

176
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,520
quickly. All the functionality is built. Now we're strapping on the UI, which, of course, is always

177
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:01,800
the hardest part. Um, oh, we're going to be surfacing those links, uh, a hell of a lot better,

178
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,120
so you can, uh, so you can find it. Okay, so I have to call up screaming at me.

179
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:17,320
It's all football, man. Here's one for all the gigs. You know who you are.

180
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:34,920
Every one is so vulnerable. I'm there busy, except for me. The world wide web is so insecure,

181
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:52,600
town aside, but I'm so glad. I am fireworld in every single way, nerds can't bring me down.

182
00:12:52,680 --> 00:13:07,320
And I run anti-virus every single day. Yes, nerds can't bring me down. No, no,

183
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,880
ain't gonna bring me down today.

184
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:36,760
To all you moops, you're delirious, your brows are closed. You're so exfoliating, yeah. You're trying

185
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:46,200
hard to fix that awful mess that used to be. Your precious piece, see to you let that

186
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:57,000
virus in, but I'm unhackable no matter what they say. Let's get and bring me down.

187
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:11,640
My fishing filter told me that this is not eBay. Yes, nerds can't bring me down. Oh, no,

188
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:19,160
ain't gonna bring me down today. You get your money, space, head, to get your money.

189
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,920
There's gonna come anti-virus, you're delirious, your brows are closed. You're delirious, your brows are closed.

190
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:33,960
It's all matter, I'm again, you gotta lose, clean in your face. You'll be sees a big disgrace.

191
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:44,760
Fire since he comes back, you probably should have bought a knife. I am fire walled and never sing away.

192
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:53,080
Let's get and bring me down. Oh, no, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

193
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:05,960
I've got spyware blast. Turing in my train. Yes, please get bring me down. Oh, no, no, oh, oh, don't

194
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:15,960
Oh, how beautiful is that, huh?

195
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,960
For all the nerds.

196
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,960
That's Bob Riching.

197
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,960
I've been out of to call the Fump Unhackable.

198
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,960
You'll find out on the Podscape Music Network a night.

199
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Of course it is.

200
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,960
Today.

201
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:44,960
Of course it's a cover, which is always a gray area, but under the auspices of fair use for satire.

202
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,960
I'm sure it's going to be okay.

203
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
I hope.

204
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
You know what?

205
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,960
I don't know if you're listening to the track, or maybe even DJ Lobster does at the opening of the show.

206
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,960
With the say, say, say, isn't the all-star jam?

207
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,960
I could hear some anomalies going on with the audio.

208
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,960
So I'm going to make today show a little bit short because it's just going to drive me nuts.

209
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Hey, if I'm paying attention to it.

210
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Oh, this is really good.

211
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
So this is kind of cool.

212
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,960
It's been going on for this is the, to just 720, 720.

213
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,960
So the fourth that actually within three episodes, we were able to solve a pretty interesting problem.

214
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:30,960
The one of the chuckleheads had with his Nokia, not the 810, but the 800, but he did have the new internet tablet software.

215
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,960
And his flash plug-in apparently stopped world flash.

216
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
The hell is going on.

217
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
Stop.

218
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,960
His flash didn't work on his browser anymore.

219
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
And we couldn't figure it out.

220
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,960
And we had another chucklehead call up and give him some advice.

221
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,960
And check and see if the plug-ins had mysteriously become disabled and low on behold.

222
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Thank you so much for the fix.

223
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Work with a dream.

224
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Turn the plug-in back on.

225
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Drop rate flash and work like a dream.

226
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,960
You want to talk to Nokia people and tell them the text and not be such asses.

227
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,960
I mean, the guy I'm technical at Facebook and told me, well, you're screwed.

228
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
We're not doing any updates.

229
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
So live with it.

230
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,960
That's quite literally what the guy told me.

231
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,960
And all he had to do was tell me to turn on the plug-in.

232
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Thank you very much.

233
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
You have a call for a game with the fix.

234
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,960
I really appreciate that.

235
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Yeah, man.

236
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,960
That's how it's supposed to work.

237
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,960
Absolutely.

238
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
You send it in.

239
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
We fix all the problems.

240
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,960
And let me see.

241
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,960
I got a whole bunch of count coming about the Snoop Dogg nation notice the United Kingdom.

242
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,960
The surveillance state.

243
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
I'm thinking, now, I'm not going to play those.

244
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,960
I want to save those for tomorrow.

245
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Or maybe on Monday, I'm going to San Francisco next week.

246
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,960
So it'll be the true test of the mobile setup on the road.

247
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,960
Oh, well, I really want to tell a port.

248
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,960
It's funny because when you think about flying that distance, it's like 10 hour flight.

249
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,960
You think about it's like, oh, man, it's going to take a whole day.

250
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,960
It really doesn't take a day because you leave around 11 am and you arrive around 130 pm.

251
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,960
So you don't really miss all that much out of the day kind of because of the times on changes.

252
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,960
And then actually when I'm flying, I kind of enjoy it because it's so nice and calm.

253
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
But, you know, it's kind of sucks.

254
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Particularly, I just don't want to go.

255
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
I want to be with my family, my girls.

256
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,960
We got to.

257
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
We got to.

258
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
We got some stuff going on with pod shows.

259
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
We got to rock and roll now.

260
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,960
We've got to start doing it while the iron is still hot.

261
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,960
So I don't know what you're doing for Valentine's Day for your loved one.

262
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,960
A lot of people think it's just a commercial bunch of who we.

263
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,960
And so they don't participate in it, but I'm a sucker that way.

264
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,960
And actually Christina gave us a Valentine's card this morning, which was very sweet.

265
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
You know, I think for, well, Christina's 17.

266
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,960
So for at least 10 years, maybe 12 Patricia's always bought her a Valentine's card.

267
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,960
And she didn't do it this year.

268
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Patricia bought me one, of course.

269
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,960
And then.

270
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,960
So she didn't buy one for Christina and Christina had bought one for us with the best mom and dad in the world.

271
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
I'm like, oh, that's so cool.

272
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,960
So of course, Patricia felt like shit was just pretty funny.

273
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
All right, so we're going to play Valentine's song for you.

274
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,960
And this is actually, you know, this is, I told you it was really easy.

275
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,960
If you want to get your song played on the daily source code, all you got to do is

276
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,960
preferably be female.

277
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Cute is good as well.

278
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,960
And do some good songs and send me a comment.

279
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
That's that easy literally.

280
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,960
What the hell is that?

281
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Oh, man.

282
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
I got the wrong one.

283
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
Hold on a second.

284
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
I hate it when that happens.

285
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
It was all set up to hold on.

286
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,960
This is the right.

287
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
This is the one I want.

288
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
Whoa.

289
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,960
No, that was interesting.

290
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Huh.

291
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,960
I was dragging a file onto the sound by the application.

292
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,960
Oh, this is turning out to be a real geek fest.

293
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,960
And I passed over Ableton Live.

294
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,960
And boy, didn't like that.

295
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,960
I thought it had to import a song just because I passed over it.

296
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Sorry about that.

297
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Okay.

298
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
I got a bit into it.

299
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Basically, I had to restart and pick this up.

300
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,960
So you missed a minute of my life.

301
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Doesn't that suck, huh?

302
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Hey Adam.

303
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
It's a little straight from Holland.

304
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:28,960
It's when I was always singing and dancing and listening to music and loving your show.

305
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
Now, I got to tell you something.

306
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,960
A few weeks ago, I was around in my bike.

307
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,960
When my head up in the clouds, all in love, and I got this melody.

308
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
That doesn't she sound awesome.

309
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Doesn't she sound full of energy and yet something very naughty behind those words?

310
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
Mind.

311
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
And I just sang a little bit.

312
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Got a few lyrics in my head.

313
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,960
And I got home to a friend of mine, Karen.

314
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,960
And she was just playing a little bit guitar and I started to sing.

315
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,960
And we're just jamming, just playing around, fooling around.

316
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,960
And we wrote this great love song.

317
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
It's called Amazing.

318
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,960
And it is amazing.

319
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,960
It's got a whole love vibe going on.

320
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
Yeah, baby.

321
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,960
But before you're going to play, I just have to say,

322
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Will you please stop sending me a request about naked pictures?

323
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
Okay, I really don't like it.

324
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,960
And lady, just call me.

325
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
She doesn't like it either.

326
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
So you better stop, all right?

327
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Okay.

328
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,960
So I would love it if you would play the song.

329
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
And you'll love it too.

330
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
I'm sure.

331
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,960
For everyone else who's going to love it,

332
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,960
check it out on LuluMusic.com.

333
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Amazing.

334
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
Oh, by the way.

335
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Yeah.

336
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Love you.

337
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
And I'm mean it right here.

338
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
I'm going to cook you in.

339
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
I love you.

340
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
I'm mean it.

341
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Great hair.

342
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Oh, you mean it.

343
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,960
I love you, mean it.

344
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
Great hair.

345
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Hope you win.

346
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Thanks, baby.

347
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,960
I love the way you start to smile.

348
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,960
When you look at me,

349
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,960
A grateful look so full,

350
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,960
It's like there's no one else to see.

351
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,960
The way we said together,

352
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,960
feels like the world is ours.

353
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,960
The things you said the way you left

354
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,960
I know that the world needs ours.

355
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Cause you're so amazing.

356
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:50,960
And you're so truly in love.

357
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Yes, it's so amazing.

358
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:19,960
How you've got me in love.

359
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,960
I love the way you stroke my hair,

360
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,960
but it's a shame to speak.

361
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,960
The care you share through your hands

362
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,960
with a tennis show me.

363
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,960
We lay together,

364
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,960
feels like the world is ours.

365
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,960
The things you say the way you look

366
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,960
I know that the world is ours.

367
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Cause you're so amazing.

368
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:06,960
And you're so truly in love.

369
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Yes, it's so amazing.

370
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,960
How you've got me in love.

371
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:30,960
Cause you're so amazing.

372
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:38,960
And you're so truly in love.

373
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Yes, it's so amazing.

374
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:56,960
How you've got me in love.

375
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:06,960
I love, I love, I love, I love.

376
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,960
It's not just a beautiful story.

377
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Right in her bike, feeling in love, went back home.

378
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:28,960
I wrote some lyrics with a friend.

379
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:36,960
And recorded the song.

380
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,960
And here it is, in the, well, I can say hundreds of thousands of years.

381
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
How awesome is that, man?

382
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
I love what we're doing.

383
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,960
I hate the fact that my sound system sounds crap,

384
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
but otherwise I'm pretty happy.

385
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,960
As Lulu, and you're so amazing, the DSC bonus edition,

386
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,960
for which, of course, I'm very grateful.

387
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,960
So I'm going to work on this stuff.

388
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,960
Tomorrow we'll do a proper food bar Friday.

389
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,960
I'm going to be home tomorrow.

390
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,960
If time to prepare for it, get everything set up and ready.

391
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
I'll fix all of the crackles.

392
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,960
And we'll be jamming it out with some great songs.

393
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,960
Hit test, maybe Amy Mackle, bring the,

394
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
ostracized by.

395
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,960
And we'll talk with some angry brits who are both angry at,

396
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,960
the state of affairs in the UK.

397
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,960
And also angry at me.

398
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
So how much fun will that be, huh?

399
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
All right, everybody.

400
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
