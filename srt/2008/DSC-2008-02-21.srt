Hey, Miss something, how you doing? You done with your next class of wine?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
How do you feel?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Feeling kind of scary right now?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Uh-huh, so you're feeling a little woozy right now?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I am.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What do you wear?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What do you wear?

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm wearing pajamas.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So you got pajamas bottoms and a pajamas top?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah, I'm simple like that.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I was actually...

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I was a little Sam, let's just have a pretty alternate...

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
...and it's sale.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You made a booty call and it's failed.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So you see this?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's sale.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Boy's are so dumb.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're kidding me.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If I were in Brooklyn right now, I'd be your booty call baby.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I was just so...

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I was a booty call.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And we were all.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What do you do every night?

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And if I'm staggering, if I'm not getting someone else?

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Really?

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Of course.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I think I do everything.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Every night?

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Every night?

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I think I'm a little...

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
...when I'm ordered.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah, there's a pattern.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Really?

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Really?

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's always the same thing.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The end of the day, always go to the store and buy batteries.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And I'm going to be branded as the girl,

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
but the real, the serious, common stadium.

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I certainly hope so.

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No.

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No.

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I just need to relax.

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There's needs to help.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Everybody's surprised.

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm just gonna take a couple of days for myself.

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I wish I had more girls.

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I gotta tell you.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not alone.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't know.

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Cut girl.

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Adam, you got girl.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I love it.

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Grim and on wine.

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I really appreciate this, you know,

60
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
because I'm an old guy and this makes me feel really hot.

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay.

62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Thank you.

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Thank you.

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Welcome to the DSC 727.

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We're hopefully on this show.

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Adam Curry will finally reveal

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
that he and only he was the mastermind behind.

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Millie Vanilli.

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Come on, Adam.

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000

71
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

73
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We don't need no sticky and dirty things.

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I like to think I'm fine.

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000

Love shy Mr. Gorgeous kicking off

142
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,100
Daily source goes up but episode number 727 coming to you from the curry condo

143
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,100
Very rainy northern California the rain has just been following me everywhere

144
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,100
It is total crap where they're hey everybody how you doing

145
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:03,100
It's your buddy Adam and it is well it's Thursday of course

146
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,100
I had the opportunity to actually do the food war Friday this evening

147
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,100
But things are going so well and with the new set up and I'm happy how everything sounds

148
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,100
And we got people ready to call in in the chat room on the conference room like screw it

149
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,100
I'm going to do a Thursday show and a food bar Friday show of course

150
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100
The friends down under in Australia

151
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:29,100
Won't actually hear the Friday show until somewhere around Monday afternoon

152
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,100
So it's been

153
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,100
Feels like the week is almost over although we still have tomorrow to get through

154
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,100
And spend a lot of time in meetings today

155
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,100
In relatively small enclosed areas with lots of guys

156
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,100
So it started to heat up get stinky sweaty and you know

157
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,100
That's what business is all about isn't it?

158
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,100
So we got lots to do today lots of things that have come in on the voicemail

159
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,100
I'm sure there are some folks who have stuff to talk about

160
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,100
Who have called in to the talk shoe system

161
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,100
And actually I did warn everybody if you're listening now

162
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,100
He didn't hear the warning earlier

163
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,100
I thought it actually was not very nice of me to be using this talk shoe

164
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,100
Set up without actually giving anything back to them

165
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,100
The way talk shoe works as far as I understand it is you basically

166
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,100
You can set up a call it doesn't cost anything

167
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,100
And lots of people can dial in it's a great infrastructure

168
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
And I wasn't recording anything

169
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,100
So I decided to hit the record button on the talk shoe interface here

170
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,100
So there will be a version of the daily source code that you get from daily source code.com

171
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,100
And then some version of something

172
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,100
I'm not quite sure what it's going to sound like it will be at first for me

173
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,100
And when you go to the talk shoe dot com and you listen to

174
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,100
Essentially what everyone who's on the call was hearing

175
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,100
So probably pretty shitty sounding music

176
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,100
And maybe if people are talking amongst themselves

177
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,100
You'll be able to hear stuff that they're talking about

178
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,100
While I'm actually doing the show

179
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,100
And of course, they got people talking about other things

180
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,100
It would just call it into the voicemail lines

181
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,100
Hey Adam it's David from a Jacksonville Florida

182
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,100
I just wanted to call on maybe a quick comment

183
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,100
First up your pants I cranky geeks was great

184
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,100
Really enjoy that show

185
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,100
Really live into that some of the people that differ

186
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
I can usually get on there

187
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:25,100
Other than the tow crank and in how to show

188
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,100
Sebastian Republic

189
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,100
I also wanted to comment because I just listened to the latest DSC

190
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,100
And the follow was interesting that people

191
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,100
I found that

192
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
See they found that you and Leo

193
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,100
You had some kind of

194
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,100
Some kind of snack going on there

195
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,100
Yeah, that was after I did a cranky geeks

196
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
A lot of people did say hey man

197
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,100
It was in the comments actually on that episode on the show

198
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
CrankyGeeks.com and people saying

199
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,100
What was wrong?

200
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
How come Adam and Leo didn't get along?

201
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,100
What was all that?

202
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,100
What was that tension?

203
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,100
And I already spelled that by saying

204
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,100
It was absolutely no tension

205
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,100
We were just having fun and

206
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,100
And besides that

207
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
It's video, you know

208
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,100
You have no context of what's actually happening

209
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,100
It was interesting because something I noticed about Leo

210
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,100
He has this very annoying habit of talking over people

211
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,100
And I got to say I love Leo

212
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
No homo

213
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,100
Thank you's a great guy

214
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,100
I listened to practically every podcast that he puts

215
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,100
out on twitch.tv

216
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
But I've noticed through listening to

217
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
Years of podcast for him

218
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,100
That he does have a habit

219
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,100
But I don't know where it comes from

220
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,100
I guess it may be a radio thing

221
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,100
Trying to control

222
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
You know, callers and conversations

223
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,100
But just thought that was actually

224
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
Want to drop you a line

225
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,100
And what you know what I thought

226
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,100
Also, great hair

227
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,100
Hope you went

228
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
Love you to homo

229
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
35 nail

230
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
More time listener

231
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Every kid

232
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,100
I like great demographic crap

233
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
Alright man, thank you

234
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Hopefully Leo is going to invite me

235
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,100
On to Twitter Sunday

236
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,100
He did mention and he said

237
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,100
Dude, this was a lot of fun

238
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,100
You should come on on twitch Sunday

239
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,100
So while I will be in the in town

240
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
I will have everything I'll have time

241
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,100
I'm not going anywhere

242
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
It was kind of funny because he said

243
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Oh wait a minute

244
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Dave whiner is going to be on

245
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
Is that a problem?

246
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
I said no, of course not

247
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,100
I don't have any problem with that

248
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,100
And he said, well I'll have to check with Dave

249
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,100
But I have a lot of fun

250
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
We could talk about some interesting stuff

251
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,100
So we'll say he hasn't reached out to me yet

252
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,100
So I don't know if it's happening

253
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,100
But of course I'll let you know

254
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,100
And you'll see that Leo and I love each other

255
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,100
Man, it's nothing wrong going on

256
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
By the way, thanks to a

257
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Sander Sunder, I should say

258
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,100
Who did the opening for today

259
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
Show kind of recap of yesterday

260
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,100
We had miss something from Brooklyn on the show

261
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,100
I see she's already dialed in

262
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
So I'm sure that we'll be able to talk to her

263
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Girlfriend Wanker Girl

264
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,100
Let's come down from Canada and

265
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
They're together and they're drinking some wine

266
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
And listen to the show

267
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
You can find Sander's work at podcaststudio.nl

268
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
And I got a couple of

269
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
You know, I really love it when people send me

270
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,100
Intro to the program

271
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Because you know, it's like having a different intro

272
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Each time is cool

273
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
And that saves me a lot of hassle

274
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
One time that I don't have to create stuff

275
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,100
And you guys are so incredibly creative

276
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
And I received a couple

277
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Different intros for today

278
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
So of course the one you heard first

279
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Sander's then you heard

280
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Obviously, well, we all know

281
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
PD Love does a great job on doing

282
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Charlie intros

283
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
But there's also a two

284
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,100
Oh, man, I damn damn damn

285
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
I got to go to my Gmail for a second

286
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
Hold on a second. I want to

287
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
I want to make sure that I credit people correctly

288
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Two pilots

289
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
Who fly a commercial

290
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
Here we go. This is from

291
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Glenn FlyingPilot.com

292
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
I recorded in an MD80 cockpit

293
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,100
Between myself and my co-pilot

294
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
At 33,000 feet

295
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Over Western Kansas

296
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,100
You've always wondered what those pilots are doing

297
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
Up front while you're sitting in back

298
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,100
And thinking everything is all safe and sound

299
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,100
And they're paying attention to what's going on

300
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Well, here's what they're really doing in the cockpit

301
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Hey, man

302
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
What's that on the horizon?

303
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,100
What's that on the screen?

304
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Bravo

305
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
That's it. You don't have to hear it Charlie seven

306
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
Twenty seven

307
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
Who's that?

308
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
Big red retro 80s

309
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Look and do the controls and the pink jumper

310
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
I have no idea

311
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,100
Are you sure it's a dude?

312
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
Are you sure it's a dude?

313
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Yeah, thank you very much

314
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
Oh, that reminds me by the way

315
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
I've got a couple of emails about this

316
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
And this

317
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
I'll let me find this for you

318
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,100
This is a new website that apparently is getting some traction

319
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,100
Because I must have received about 20 different

320
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,100
Twenty different links to it

321
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:10,100
www.men who look like old lesbians.blogspot.com

322
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Yeah, you guessed it

323
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
I'm right up there with the best of them

324
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,100

From show such as Five Funny by Midnight

Film Spotting

341
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
That's what she said

342
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,100
The Matt cast the typical Mac user

343
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100

I sent out a tweet

355
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,100
A tweet

356
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
With instructions which of course

357
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
Lead you right back to curry.com

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100

And I'll bring in as soon as I can

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Couple of other interesting calls that came into the voicemail

363
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,100
This one trip me out

364
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Because it made me realize that

365
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
We're really onto something here

366
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,100
I mean like real power and podcasting

367
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,100
Although this message is for Adam Curry

368
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,100
My name is Constance Rockline

369
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,100
I'm calling on behalf of Dr. Murray

370
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Saber and who is running for UN

371
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
So when I first heard

372
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,100

373
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,100
Wait a minute this is I

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,100
Why Dr.'s calling me

375
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,100
But it's Dr. Murray Saber and let's listen

376
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,100

377
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,100

And talk about his campaign

380
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
If you would like to call me back my phone number

381
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,100
I'll just talk over the phone number for a second

382
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,100

383
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
Or you can email me

384
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100

385
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
No time to edit

386
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
C-O-N-S-T-A-N-C-E

387
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,100
At M-U-R-A-Y-A-A-A-N

388
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,100
Thank you

389
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
Alright so

390
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,100
What is up with this?

391
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,100
I'm like wait a minute

392
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Here is someone who's running for Senate

393
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Calling in to the voicemail line

394
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
So you know obviously

395
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,100
Not an insider has no real contact when they know email

396
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,100
Just through the voicemail

397
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Saying that the candidate

398
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Would like to talk to me

399
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Oh

400
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,100
I like it

401
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,100
That's pretty cool

402
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,100
So now I'm a part of the political engine

403
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,100
So of course I went to

404
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
TheM.com that's Sierra Elf Abravo

405
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,100
Romeo in the At November

406
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,100
Actually the Murray Sabre in all one word

407
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
And well low and behold

408
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,100
I think this is a guy that I can support

409
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Because the first thing I saw was a YouTube video

410
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
With the following

411
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
Well it's good to be here today with my friend Murray

412
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
And I'm very happy to endorse his candidacy

413
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
For the US Senate

414
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
This to me is very necessary

415
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
Because Murray and I have been good friends for a long time

416
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,100
We have strong agreement on all economic policies

417
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
And on the social policies as well

418
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
So he's going to make a great candidate

419
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100
And a great senator

420
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,100
And it is right now

421
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Because the economic policies

422
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
Becoming so important

423
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,100
This is why we need somebody

424
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
Murray out there campaigning

425
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
And running and being a senator

426
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
Because this economy is going to come unravel

427
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
And we need the free market

428
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Hard money approach to this

429
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
We have the answers

430
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,100
We know how we got in this trouble

431
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,100
We have to do Murray Sabre is the answer

432
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
He's the one that can present the case

433
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
And New Jersey will benefit

434
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,100
By his election

435
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,100
So before he jumps in an answer

436
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,100
So basically you're seeing a video of Dr. Rompall

437
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
With Dr. Murray Sabre

438
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
And standing next to each other

439
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
I presume somewhere in Washington

440
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
I can see a capital building in the background

441
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
And so you look at his website here

442
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
And I do this and another one of these guys

443
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Who's switching on

444
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Here's his platform

445
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
For interrere and illegal immigration

446
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,100
To cure our economic well

447
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Being by getting government off our backs

448
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,100
And out of our wallets

449
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,100
And I like this one

450
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
Secura first class education for our children

451
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
So they can compete in the global economy

452
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,100
And I propose federal tax credits

453
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,100
To allow parents to exercise their school

454
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,100
Choice rights

455
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,100
From my adopted homestay

456
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100
New Jersey

457
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
Like it

458
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
Okay here's Murray

459
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,100
I want to thank you Ron. I've been on each other for the nearly 30 years

460
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,660
years and that's a pleasure to represent you in the state of New Jersey. I've been around

461
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,340
the presidential forum throughout the state. I'll continue to do so until February 5th

462
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,980
and it's been a real honest any side-by-side with you for all these many years to promote

463
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,380
free markets and limited government. Thank you. Good luck in your campaign. Thank you.

464
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,100
So I don't know much about this guy but I will look into him and of course I'm going to have

465
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,420
him on the show. I always like that. Anyone from New Jersey happened to be listening

466
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,500
in tonight. If you are, just give me a wave in the chat room or anyone who knows anything

467
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:36,900
about this guy. I love to know about it. And while you guys are thinking about that very

468
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:43,460
difficult question, I received an email from the Lady Patricia. She sent a to me just before she

469
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:50,500
went to bed. Actually it was an email with a YouTube video attached to it and I went ahead and

470
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:57,060
broke all the rules and recorded the song that she sent for me. I think you'll recognize that

471
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,780
if you were around in 1972. Love me, see you forever.

472
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:43,060
All right, sing along everybody. It must be love, love, love.

473
00:18:50,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Love is love, love is love, love is love, love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love

474
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,180
love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is health is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love

475
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Mach is the first

476
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:38,500
I know that it's you I need to take the blues away

477
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,500
It must be love, love, love, love

478
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,500
It must be love, love, love, love

479
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Nothing more, nothing less, nothing less than nothing

480
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,500
It must be love, love, love

481
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,500
It must be love, love, love

482
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Nothing more, nothing less than nothing less than nothing

483
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500
It's such a beautiful song

484
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,500
And to receive that for my lover, long distance

485
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
I just make she feel good all over

486
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Love is see-for, it must be love, love, love

487
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,500
I see DJ Stain in the chat room saying that he's familiar with the song

488
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
But not from the 1970s

489
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,500
But from its use in a toilet paper advertisement

490
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Wow, wonderful, don't you just love what commercialism does to me

491
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,500
I see a wanker girls on

492
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Wanker girls, are you there?

493
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Are you there with Miss Something from Brooklyn?

494
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Yes, yes, yes

495
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Oh boy, are you not dialed in on Skype by your darling?

496
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Is that really sucks?

497
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Yeah, you can break it up

498
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Are you actually in Brooklyn with Miss Something?

499
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,500
Yeah, I'm sitting right next to her

500
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Hold on a second, let me just do something here

501
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Let me, I gotta try this one

502
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
There we go, okay

503
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,500
I had to mute everybody else because there was too much noise on

504
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Okay, so what you guys, when did you get in?

505
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Ah man, it's not gonna work

506
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,500
What, when did you get in Wanker girl?

507
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
You know Adam, we're gonna call back in

508
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Okay, you go ahead and do that

509
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
And I'll unmute everybody else

510
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
There you go

511
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
We'll do my son

512
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
What a bunch of noise

513
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
All right, well you're dialing right back

514
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Here's something interesting that came in today

515
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Something Apple is intending on doing

516
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Although I don't know if they're actually intending on doing it

517
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,500
But apparently there is a patent filing for the following

518
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Hey Adam, this is Monica for you

519
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Just a story about a patent that Apple's trying to get on

520
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:08,500
On the man podcasting and basically I understand it is

521
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Taking Snips out of a podcast that's putty been

522
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
And customizing a feed

523
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,500
But from different podcasts which seems kind of distinct

524
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
You can read about it on

525
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Or at least why I found it was Apple inside your dot com

526
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,500
And it had like Apple looks towards personal advice

527
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
On the man podcast

528
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Those interesting ones get come to that

529
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,500
Love you in a homo and all the rest

530
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
Bye

531
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Yeah man, thank you

532
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,500
So I looked that up and indeed on the Apple Insider

533
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
It looks like

534
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
It's kind of interesting

535
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,500
It's something that is not really a new idea

536
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,500
But what this patent filing or whatever it is

537
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
It intends to do

538
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,500
Is for Apple apparently or through iTunes

539
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
Whatever

540
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,500
To be able to assemble a new podcast

541
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
A new file that you would download

542
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Which consists of pieces of other shows

543
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
And the examples they have is

544
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,500
Well you may not be interested in the entire program

545
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Maybe you only want one little piece

546
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
So you can take a little piece from this one

547
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
A little piece from that one

548
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
A little piece from that one

549
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
And you can then mash them together

550
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,500
And it'll automatically turn into a show that you want

551
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Essentially

552
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,500
The same thing we have put together with channels with full shows

553
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
So you can determine the order that you want

554
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
So for instance my channel my on the go channel

555
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
You can see it at atom.podshow.com

556
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
You can hit play

557
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
And you'll see exactly what happens

558
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
It has an intro

559
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Then it always goes to the weather report for Guilford

560
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Which is an automatic robot weather report

561
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Then it gets the New York Times front page

562
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
And then I think tech five

563
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,500
With John Devorak and then it goes into someone

564
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Longer shows like Pacific Coast, Hellway

565
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
And buzz out loud and other stuff that I listened to

566
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
And I kind of just hit it once

567
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
And it's an automatically generating playlist

568
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
But it's the whole shows

569
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,500
It's very interesting if if Apple or anyone for that matter

570
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
Intends to chop up

571
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Programs that are created

572
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,500
And to create derivative works out of that

573
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,500
I'm not quite sure how I feel about it actually

574
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
So for instance you could say

575
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,500
I'm only interested in having the hit test

576
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Out of the daily source code on Fridays

577
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,500
And I want to mash that together with something else

578
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
It's I don't know

579
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,500
I have my kind of my doubts about it

580
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
If I think that's a good thing or not

581
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,500
How about anyone out there on the call

582
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,500
See corpaters and you read the same article

583
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:45,500
Boy that was a long silence wasn't it

584
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,500
Did anyone out there read this article?

585
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,500
No

586
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Okay

587
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
Sometimes this live call and stuff really works

588
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,500
And sometimes it just kind of doesn't

589
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,500
Boy do I really need to have a

590
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,500
A moderator or someone who can a hand razor

591
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,500
Or are you on now?

592
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
It was muted

593
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,500
Okay

594
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
Well let's go back to Wanker girl

595
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
See if she's back on

596
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
But I'm here

597
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Hey that's much better

598
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
Are you calling through regular phone now?

599
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Yeah

600
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
The call let me use salsa

601
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Oh that's so sweet of her

602
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,500
So you just got into it

603
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
You just got in today

604
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Yeah

605
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
I got in around ten thirty this morning

606
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
My flight was at five o'clock

607
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
Thank you sleeping

608
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Now what I'd like you to do is

609
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
I'd like you to explain to the audience

610
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
The story behind you

611
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
And let me just mute everybody else

612
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Just so we have a better sound

613
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
Just a few guys

614
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,500
I'd like you to explain

615
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
The story of how you two met

616
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Because I think it was partially through either podcast

617
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
Or maybe even pod show right?

618
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
That's absolutely right

619
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
Okay

620
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Let's turn back the clock

621
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
It's time for a moment here

622
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,500
And around I guess it was a year and a half ago

623
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,500
I and my boyfriend is 10 years

624
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
We broke up

625
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Lots of tears, lots of trauma

626
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
All of that stuff

627
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
And so I did a show

628
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
I actually

629
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
Wait a minute let me ask you

630
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
Let me ask you a question

631
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Wanker girl

632
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Did he dump you or did you dump him?

633
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Very complicated question

634
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,500
No I think it's quite simple

635
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
But from your answer

636
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
I presume he dumped you

637
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
Yes, initially somewhat

638
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
But then

639
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
Sort of came close

640
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,500
And back

641
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
What happened?

642
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
Did he cheat on you?

643
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
No no no no no

644
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,500
He just went a little crazy

645
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
And started acting pretty weird

646
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,500
And

647
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
What do you mean?

648
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Explain it to him

649
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,500
He sort of got involved with another girl online

650
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
Yeah

651
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
And I sort of didn't find out about that

652
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
So afterwards

653
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,500
And you have a problem with that?

654
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,500
No, actually no

655
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,500
I don't

656
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
But he wanted to meet her

657
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
And be with her

658
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
And all of that stuff

659
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Okay, that's a problem

660
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,500
That is a problem

661
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,500
Yeah

662
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
Okay, all right

663
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
So you guys broke up

664
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
And it was a big big trauma

665
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
And at the same time

666
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,500
We have

667
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Something over here who lives in Brooklyn

668
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
And she had the similar experience

669
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Or she also broke up with her boyfriend

670
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
Or whatever

671
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
Exactly

672
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,500
She had a breakup of her own

673
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
And she ended up finding my show

674
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
And because the podcast

675
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
She was well

676
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
And I had a show that was all about my breakup

677
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
And she emailed me

678
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,500
And from that one email

679
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,500
Let's do many, many, many, many, many emails

680
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
Sort of a

681
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
Initially sort of

682
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,500
Sort of

683
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
What I mean in complaining

684
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Probably a little bit at the beginning

685
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
But then it just became

686
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
About us hanging out and talking

687
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,500
And I think

688
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
After like three or four months

689
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Sort of email in each other

690
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
I helped out a plane

691
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
And came to New York

692
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,500
And I met her

693
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,500
So this rest is history

694
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,500
Right, because this is actually

695
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Become much more

696
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,500
From what I understand

697
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
You two have created some

698
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
You know, fantastic female bond

699
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
And you've pulled each other

700
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
Through this traumatic experience

701
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
And now I mean

702
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
This is, you guys hook up all the time

703
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Right?

704
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,500
I mean, she's either going up to see you

705
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Or you're coming down to see her

706
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,500
That's right, she's my best friend

707
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Okay

708
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Now last night

709
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
She's giving me a cheers

710
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
With a glass of wine right now

711
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
Perfect, perfect

712
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
Because last night

713
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
She called into the show

714
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
And she was a little bit woozy

715
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
And she had one or two glasses of wine

716
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
She said she's a lightweight

717
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,500
And she was pretty revealing

718
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
And I got to tell you

719
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,500
It was fascinating to listen to

720
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
So you guys drink it

721
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Drink it together

722
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,500
I don't know

723
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
All of that stuff

724
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Are you guys drinking together

725
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
No?

726
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Yeah, yeah

727
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
We're drinking together

728
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,500
We're on our second bottle of wine

729
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,500
No way

730
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,500
Oh man

731
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Yes way

732
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Oh way, okay, awesome

733
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,500
Awesome, what are you guys wearing

734
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
What are we wearing

735
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,500
Yeah, so you're sitting there in her apartment

736
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Which I think it's about as a big as a box car

737
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
And

738
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,500
And you're drinking wine

739
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
And you're listening to the show

740
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
And now I just have

741
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Are you like

742
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Do you have your comfortable clothes on

743
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
You curled up on the couch or

744
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
Just give me the scene

745
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
So I can kind of imagine it

746
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Well, what obviously make it out of

747
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
Exactly, that's what I wanted to hear

748
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,500
Ah nice nice nice nice nice

749
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
I love to please the fans

750
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Yeah, no, I know you are

751
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,500
You're not kidding, right?

752
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
You guys are sitting there

753
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Half naked, I'm sure

754
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,500
No, I did, of course I do

755
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
Look, I've spent three minutes on you already

756
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
I need to know all kinds of stuff pretty soon

757
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:56,500
Yeah, so basically I actually listened to the show

758
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,500
Because I got into the city this morning

759
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
And she told me that she had pulled into

760
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
And so I listened to the show

761
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,500
And you know, it made me get a little bit

762
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Okay

763
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
But it was very entertaining

764
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
Okay, all right

765
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
I'm assuming that it's just mostly boys

766
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
That call into your show

767
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Well, yeah, they call in all the time

768
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
But I only put girls on the air

769
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,500
Listen, why don't you guys have another

770
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Another couple of sips of wine

771
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
And I'll check him with you later

772
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
And see how you're doing

773
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,500
And see if you're feeling a little bit more comfortable

774
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Oh, of course, we'll be waiting for you

775
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
Okay, I love that

776
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
Hi, that means the candy man

777
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
Once again with some audio feedback

778
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:45,500
This time, some feedback on your cranky geek

779
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,500
Geeks appearance yesterday

780
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,500
Of course, I mean, the four of you, you're all good guys

781
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,500
And you know what you are doing

782
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,500
But I just, personally, I'm having some, let's say

783
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,500
Problems with the show itself

784
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,500
Okay, all right, the first, oh, this is, this is Luke the candy man

785
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
He's my Nokia hookup

786
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
But we just, we just call him the candy man

787
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,500
And he, oh, he's very opinionated this Luke guy

788
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,500
And he likes to send me text messages

789
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Really long ones that come in in like seven or eight different parts

790
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,500
Because they get broken up after 140 characters

791
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
Whatever the limit is

792
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
That's always interesting, I'm sitting in a meeting

793
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,500
And my, my phone starts vibrating

794
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
And I'm like, oh, I wonder who's SMSing now

795
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
I was like, no, the one?

796
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Oh, that's gotta be Luke

797
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,500
Geeks and the four months, it's in, it's kind of for me

798
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,500
It looks like it's, it's everything

799
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
That is wrong with television at the moment

800
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,500
I mean, there was no discussion, none of the topics

801
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,500
We're kind of covered in, in great death

802
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Everything was, was rather shallow

803
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
And then once the discussion got started

804
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,500
It was cut short by commercial break

805
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
So for instance, this item on

806
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,500
HD and video and video uploading issues

807
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
And everything you discussed around that

808
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Interesting discussion which was kind of ended

809
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,500
Hanging in the air, I mean the show itself

810
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,500
It's kind of good entertainment

811
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
But yeah, when you watch it, you get the feeling

812
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Everybody is kind of in a hurry

813
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Everybody just gives their opinion

814
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,500
But there is no real structured discussion going on

815
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,500
And perhaps that's not the, not the idea behind the show either

816
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,500
But then I'm wondering what does this add on top of what we can see

817
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
On television day in the day out already

818
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,500
So it would be, it would be good to have your views on that

819
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
And yeah, it would be interesting to hear

820
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
Okay, thanks, boy

821
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,500
Wow, well my views on that, Luke

822
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Candyman

823
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,500
First of all, please point me towards the show on television

824
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,500
That is anything remotely like cranky geeks

825
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,500
That even has any of the stories that are remotely like cranky geeks

826
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,500
Or any of the fantastic personalities

827
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Like cranky geeks

828
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Actually, there is a very structured show

829
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
I think it's a fabulous format

830
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
You have two guests

831
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
You have Jonsi Dvorak

832
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Who basically is the moderator of the conversation

833
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
But it's opinionated

834
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,500
And the real cool thing about cranky geeks

835
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,500
Is you've got the shill

836
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
Sebastian the shill

837
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
Who not only selects the stories

838
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
But he's kind of there

839
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
To prod the conversation

840
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Or to pull back and be quiet when appropriate

841
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,500
I think it's a, it's a great format

842
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,500
And you know, where else will you find out about a scuba car?

843
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,500
But actually the HD conversation

844
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,500
I have not seen that on television anywhere

845
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
So I don't know what you're looking for

846
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
But look, at the end of the day

847
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,500
Video, no matter where you're looking at it on television

848
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Or particularly on your computer

849
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
I mean when people are looking at their computer

850
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
And looking at a piece of video

851
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,500
It's only a small piece of the real estate on that screen

852
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
There's all kinds of stuff happening there

853
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,500
All kinds of distractions you've got Twitter going

854
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
You've got your email coming in

855
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,500
Some other instant messenger

856
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
God knows what you've got to run

857
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
And we've got to keep people engaged

858
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
And that means you've got to be short

859
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
You've got to be in and you've got to be out

860
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
If we would make this thing any longer

861
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Like it's only half an hour

862
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,500
And we go through seven or eight topics

863
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,500
I don't know, I'm confused as to

864
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,500
Is to how you actually see that that has no added value

865
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
Hmm

866
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,500
All right, let's see

867
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Oh, I got the invite from Ranger Craig

868
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,500
Or not invite, I kind of invited myself

869
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
To go over to Alcatraz

870
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,500
And see if I could do a show from the jail in the base

871
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,500
Hi Adam

872
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,500
Mike Pico

873
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Long time listener, all that jazz

874
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
I was listening to the DSC today

875
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,500
The one for the 20th of February

876
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
And it was 720

877
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
You're talking to the Ranger from Alcatraz

878
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
Yeah, I believe it's Ranger Dan

879
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
No, maybe Ranger Dave, I'm talking to him

880
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
Ranger by the Ranger over there

881
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
Craig

882
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,500
And you discussed the possibility of going out

883
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
And spending the night on the rock

884
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,500
For the podcast opportunity

885
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,500
To send some great audio back

886
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,500
And I thought that if you wanted to really draw some

887
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Some attention to the whole thing

888
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
You might want to do it for a charity

889
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,500
I really don't have anything in mind

890
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
Specifically

891
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,500
And maybe the bail add them out

892
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,500
Type of vibe has been overdone

893
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
But I really see that as a chance

894
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:25,500
To do some good with fame and notoriety

895
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
And that's just my thought

896
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,500
If you're willing to do whatever I can from where I am

897
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,500
That's your moment in Delaware

898
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,500
But hey, just thought through the idea out there

899
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Love what you do

900
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,500
Great hair

901
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,500
Great hair

902
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Love you

903
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,500
Love you, hope you win

904
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
And I'm going to leave that other thing off

905
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
Because I kind of tend to agree

906
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,500
If somebody's coming to the conversation

907
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,500
Late

908
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Probably not the best thing to throw in there

909
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,500
Do well, dude

910
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
All right, man, thank you

911
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,500
I'm not a big fan of celebrities doing charities

912
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
Because I feel that in most cases

913
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,500
It's really more beneficial to the

914
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,500
Coat celebrity status of the celebrity

915
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
And I give my money privately

916
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
And in many instances

917
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,500
Very quietly

918
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
Sometimes recipients don't even know

919
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,500
That I've donated or have helped someone out

920
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
It is different by the way

921
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,500
With the political candidate

922
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Like Dr. Ron Paul who I continue to support

923
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,500
And who is still absolutely in the running

924
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,500
For a public and nomination

925
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,500
For as the Republican candidate

926
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,500
You never know what can happen

927
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
You already see a little scandal happening

928
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,500
With the John McCain there

929
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
I mean, nothing too is nothing bad

930
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Nothing nothing nothing nuts

931
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,500
He'll get over it

932
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
But anything can happen

933
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,500
You know, it's

934
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
You're basically only a heartbeat away

935
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,500
And every single instance

936
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
Hey, by the way, has did anyone see

937
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,500
The rumors been around for a long, long time

938
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
About Hillary Clinton

939
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Having a

940
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
A lesbian lover

941
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
And today I saw

942
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
It's probably related to the McCain thing

943
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
Now all the stuff is bubbling up to the top

944
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,500
But this woman

945
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Who is this beautiful Pakistani woman

946
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Who is rumored to be her lesbian lover

947
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,500
I mean, this is

948
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,500
I actually got kind of turned on by the whole idea

949
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
Has anyone else seen that?

950
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
Who's dialed in right now?

951
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Anyone see this woman

952
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,500
Who apparently is having an affair with the Hillary Clinton?

953
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
I love this

954
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,500
I love it

955
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,500
I ask questions, no one answers

956
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Let's check in, Wanker Girl

957
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,500
How are you guys doing?

958
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Speaking of lesbians

959
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,500
I'm lying down now

960
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
And where's this something

961
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
Is she lying down next here?

962
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
I don't know

963
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
She's like a stupid way

964
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,500
She has to consider

965
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
I've ever

966
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
You guys ever get really close when you're all

967
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,500
I can imagine where you're like

968
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,500
You know, depressed about your boyfriends

969
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
And you're kind of

970
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,500
You know, commiserating together

971
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
And then you think, you know, screw it

972
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Let's, we're doing away with men all together

973
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
And maybe we should just

974
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Maybe we should just try something together

975
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,500
Well, you know, she's inspired us

976
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Oh, really?

977
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
Well, you know

978
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Um, what you've been a big

979
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
Um, sort of the tone

980
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
And I was just sending me to pictures

981
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,500
I think, right?

982
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Yes

983
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Well, you guys would send naked pictures

984
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
To each other

985
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Before we knew it, so

986
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
Wait a minute

987
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,500
So you would send naked pictures to each other

988
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
And that would help you get over the heartbreak

989
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Is that it?

990
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Not quite

991
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Not quite

992
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,500
Um, how do I say this?

993
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Just say it

994
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
Look, it's our, listen, it's just us

995
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,500
It's just you, you me and a couple other people listening

996
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Um, well, um, I guess

997
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
Sort of when we first started talking

998
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,500
And then we both had sort of

999
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,500
Our separate sort of online relationship

1000
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,500
Takenings

1001
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,500
Together

1002
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Oh, with other men, okay?

1003
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,500
Yeah

1004
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
And whatever we would send anything

1005
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Send them pictures

1006
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
So each other

1007
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,500
And sort of like what do you think

1008
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,500
And who's who's like says

1009
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,500
Talk louder, baby

1010
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,500
You're breaking up

1011
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,500
You're breaking up a little bit

1012
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
But what we would send

1013
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
We would send pictures to be men

1014
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
On my, but before we would send them

1015
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,500
We would send other and get opinion

1016
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,500
Oh, for like approval

1017
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,500
Okay, and when with these be just

1018
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,500
The pictures of your face

1019
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
With a little bit of top

1020
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,500
Now

1021
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
No

1022
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Oh, wow

1023
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,500
Okay, so then of course

1024
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
What happened is you guys were exchanging pictures

1025
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,500
And you got kind of excited by it, right?

1026
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
Oh, crap

1027
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,500
You want me to say yeah

1028
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,500
No, forget about it

1029
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,500
I wanted you to be honest

1030
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,500
That's all right

1031
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
Well, now we'll initially

1032
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,500
We were just, you know, we giggled

1033
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
And awful lot

1034
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
Because in particular

1035
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,500
I am

1036
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
I used to make these videos for this guy

1037
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,500
I'm lying

1038
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,500
And

1039
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
How come this never happens to me?

1040
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,500
I don't understand that

1041
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
I've been doing this show for

1042
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
Well, like three years now

1043
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
I've never received a naked picture

1044
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,500
I never get any naked videos

1045
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,500
Wow, what, what am I doing wrong?

1046
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,500
You have to be lying

1047
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,500
You're lying

1048
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,500
No, the only naked pictures I get

1049
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,500
Are joke naked pictures, right?

1050
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,500
So they'll send some, you know, like a photo shop

1051
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
Or, oh, here's a naked picture

1052
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,500
It's like a baby picture, you know

1053
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
So, yeah, no, I don't get that

1054
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
I absolutely do not get that

1055
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
I think that way

1056
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
I always imagine that

1057
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
It's actually a lot of pictures

1058
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
Or

1059
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
No, not a single one

1060
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,500
So fast

1061
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,500
So fast

1062
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
Well, we do that a lot

1063
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,500
It was actually quite funny

1064
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
Because, like, basically before we actually even

1065
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,500
That each other

1066
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
We've seen each other completely naked

1067
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,500
And it's been completely natural

1068
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
We've been completely natural

1069
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,500
Yeah, I agree

1070
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,500
It is natural

1071
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
And I think you should do it some more

1072
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,500
And maybe tomorrow

1073
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,500
We are sleeping in the same bed

1074
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,500
Of course you are

1075
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,500
Now, would you be so kind as to send me some pictures

1076
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
To a view?

1077
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,500
You want us to send you naked

1078
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,500
I'll just pictures of us

1079
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,500
No, no, no, it would totally naked pictures

1080
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,500
Are you kidding me?

1081
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,500
And, you know, romantic, you know, like sexy

1082
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,500
So, okay, just let me clarify this

1083
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,500
That you want me in the cold to send you naked pictures

1084
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Of me and her to gather

1085
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,500
Yes

1086
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,500
Is that too much to ask?

1087
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,500
Look at what I do

1088
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,500
Look at, look at the effort I put into making this show

1089
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,500
Look at, look at all the work I'm doing

1090
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,500
Don't I deserve a break?

1091
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,500
I don't remember if you can answer that question

1092
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,500
All right

1093
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,500
All right

1094
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,500
I got

1095
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,500
It's all found to maybe in girl, you know

1096
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
You think about it for a second

1097
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,500
In the meantime, I've got

1098
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,500

1099
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,500

00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,500

Hey, look dude, I gotta tell you

1106
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
I am getting completely uncomfortable

1107
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,500
Being your pod pimp

1108
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,500
All right, I'll be your musicologist

1109
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,500
But I'm not somebody that's just going to run around

1110
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Trying to find pod babes for you

1111
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,500
All right

1112
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,500
All right, yeah, you know you're right

1113
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500

She's out of Kentucky

00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,500
And I'm just really digging her sound a lot

1119

I know, I know, I don't usually bring you some country artists

1120
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,500

00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,500
Glendonese from the bot save using network

00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,500
He said in a whole mess of song

1181
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,500
So, and I need you to be sending in some stuff as well

1182
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,500
He's going to rock it out

1183
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,500
I'll need it by the end of this week

1184
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,500
All right, man, we're already at like 46 minutes

1185
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,500
Time flies when you're having fun

1186
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,500
Hey, Mike a girl, would you mind putting Nicole on for a second

1187
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,500
Just put, put me something on the phone

1188
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
For a second, please

1189
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,500
Oh, hey baby

1190
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,500
There you are

1191
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,500
There you are

1192
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,500
Hey, how you to listen

1193
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,500
So, while she's out of the room for a second

1194
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,500
Because we know each other a little bit better

1195
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,500
I have a volume of kind of met when I grow

1196
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,500
So, this picture, you can do that for me, right

1197
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,500
Oh, I'll work on it

1198
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,500
Oh, baby

00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,500
I would, you know what

1200
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,500
And then, oh, here's what I'll do

1201
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,500
I'll make sure the range of Craig

1202
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,500
That he hooks us up

1203
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,500
So, the three of us can get thrown into jail

1204
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,500
An alcatraz for the night

1205
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,500
Did you imagine that through that would be

1206
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,500
I don't know how much

1207
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,500
You're such a tease

1208
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,500
Uh, never

1209
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,500
All right, well

1210
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
Adam, we're going to bed

1211
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,500
Okay, I know

00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,500
I know, I know that after the things of the show

1213
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
You need to do, you need to take care of business

1214
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,500
There's no supposed to take care of

1215
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,500
Okay

1216
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,500
All right, baby, thank you very much

1217
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
Say hi to uh, to blanket a little for me

1218
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,500
And maybe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow

1219
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,500
Are you probably going out tomorrow?

1220
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,500
No, you're not going to be hanging around

1221
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,500
I'm doing the show

1222
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,500
Yeah, we're not sitting by the phone

1223
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,500
Okay

1224
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,500
Just send me the picture

1225
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,500
So, I can tell everyone how awesome you guys look

1226
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,500
Okay

1227
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,500
All right, yeah

1228
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,500
Thank you

1229
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,500
All right, I love you, me

1230
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,500
I love you, me

1231
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,500
I love you, me, me, me, me, me, me

1232
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,500
Okay, bye

1233
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,500
All right, so what did I not get to?

1234
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,500
Um, there was some northern rock

1235
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,500
Actually, I will read this

1236
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,500
Uh, this was an awesome article

1237
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,500
on the register, which is one of, I have to say

1238
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,500
When it comes to certainly UK news

1239
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,500
But also some tech news

1240
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,500
The register dot was a dot com

1241
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,500
I think, right?

1242
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,500
Uh, dot code.uk

1243
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,500
Um, this was sent in by

1244
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,500
Let me check it

1245
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,500
Uh, Mark, could I have

1246
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,500
I wonder if he's related to the famous Johan

1247
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,500
Um, John Oates writes

1248
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,500
Check this out

1249
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,500
There was an inclusion

1250
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,500
Of a paragraph

1251
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,500
In the bill to nationalize northern rock

1252
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,500
Which is this bank that

1253
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,500
In case you're just joining the

1254
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,500
Conversation

1255
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,500
This bank in the United Kingdom

1256
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,500
Who were bailed out by the government

1257
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,500
With tax money to the tune of

1258
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,500
$100 billion in guarantees

1259
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,500
And this paragraph

1260
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,500
Exempts the bank from the Freedom of Information Act

1261
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,500
So

1262
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,500
The legislation to bring the bank in a public

1263
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,500
Ownership includes the paragraph

1264
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,500
Which states

1265
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,500
Northern Rock should not be covered by the

1266
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,500
Freedom of Information Act

1267
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,500
Man, this thing is really

1268
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,500
Starting to stink up the room

1269
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,500
If you know what I'm saying

1270
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,500
So the Conservatives are the

1271
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,500
Or the Tories, I should say

1272
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,500
Are now coming up and yelling about this

1273
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,500
And saying this is a messed up

1274
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,500
I think we're going to see a major crisis

1275
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,500
With Gordon Brown

1276
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,500
I think, and this is

1277
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,500
Uh, this is a lot of stuff going on

1278
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,500
This is a wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong

1279
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,500
And it's, you know, it seems like

1280
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,500
It's just rife in the labor party

1281
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,500
So when I get back to the UK

1282
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,500
Which probably won't be until the end of next week

1283
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,500
Looks like because

1284
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
Well, we're working on version 3

1285
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
Of podshow.com

1286
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,500
Working very hard

1287
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,500
We're working on tons of new productions

1288
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,500
We've got some great new campaigns for

1289
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,500
Podshow producers

1290
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,500
We're also going to be opening that up

1291
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,500
To a wider group of producers who are interested

1292
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
This is a lot of shit going on

1293
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,500
Anyway

1294
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,500
More tomorrow again

1295
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,500
Please, I'd like you to

1296
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,500
To think about sending in some tunes

1297
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,500
Soundtrack to your life

1298
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,500
Anything that you feel is appropriate for the football

1299
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,500
