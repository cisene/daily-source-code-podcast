1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Delta Shared Charlie, 8-0-1.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:13,500
And during the few moments that we have left, we're running tall, right down to that, in a language that everybody here can answer the undistinguishable.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,500
The $60 million worth of airplane straps by aspirin.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,500
For the next generation, bring you caught any mightors.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,500
We don't need a deep interest in it.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Augustine is an angry.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,500
The Kingma!

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,500
What do you say?

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,500
The concept of the reality.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,500
I know you're ready.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,500
I know you're dreams.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,500
I've been a friend in one of me.

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Oh, I'm a self-generationality.

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,500
I like most of me.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,500
And can I be?

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,500
I'm a self-generationality.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
A self-generationality.

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,500
A self-generationality.

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Me and life,

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Love and pride,

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
But I miss me,

23
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,500
To the next generation.

24
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Only you can set me free.

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,500
So thin, you need to be.

27
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,500
I'm a slime, I'm a semi-auty baby.

28
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Oh, I'm a self-generationality.

29
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

30
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

31
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Only you can set me free.

32
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,500
I'm a self-generationality.

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

34
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

35
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

36
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Me and life,

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Love and pride,

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
But I miss me,

39
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,500
To the next generation.

40
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

41
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Only you can set me free.

42
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

43
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

44
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

45
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

46
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

47
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

48
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

49
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

50
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

51
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

52
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

53
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

54
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Sergeant.

55
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,500
GO!

56
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Copima.

57
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
My partner.

58
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

59
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,500
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

60
00:04:46,500 --> 00:05:02,680
I'm thinking that's 1989, maybe 1990, oh man those guys were way far ahead of their time.

61
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,720
Hey everybody, Daily Source Code episode number 801 coming to you from the Curry Manor once again.

62
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,220
I'm back in Blighty for just a little bit after more or less five weeks on the road three

63
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:18,180
weeks in San Francisco, quick trip back to the Netherlands for the surprise party for Bob,

64
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,700
then back for another full week in San Francisco and Los Angeles and I arrived yesterday.

65
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,220
I was supposed to arrive a lot earlier and I would have maybe even have tried to e-cotta

66
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,180
show yesterday, but got in, really didn't get in the house until about 4, 4, 30.

67
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,980
So, took a little bit longer than usual, also coming in from LAX, there's different thing.

68
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:44,540
In a Virgin Atlantic uses different planes, they use the Airbus instead of the 747, so it's

69
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,540
a bit.

70
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:51,580
It's an uncomfortable kind of, honestly it reminds me, you know those diagrams of slave ships,

71
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:59,300
where we have all the bodies laid out in rows, that's kind of what the Airbus Virgin Atlantic

72
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:06,460
experience is like, it's just one long container, one long tube filled with people lay

73
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,100
down in almost that exact same position, it's kind of scary, you should look at the diagram

74
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:18,500
of the Airbus, what is it, the AS340, 600 I think is the model, it's the elongated one.

75
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,420
Anyway, it doesn't matter, I'm back here, I'm a kind of trip and out from the jet lag,

76
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,980
it's, you know, going back and forth and a week and it's just kind of weird, both the

77
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:33,220
lady Patricia and Christina have, oops, am I getting a hair cell phone signal coming through

78
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,300
here, which what where is it, ah, you know what that is, it's here, see if you can identify

79
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:46,460
this sound, can you identify that, let me try it again, that's closed and now open, that

80
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:52,820
my friends is the G1 Google phone, which we'll be giving you a review of later on in this

81
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,820
very program.

82
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,660
Anyway, both the girls are out, they left this morning, late this morning to the Netherlands

83
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,260
Patricia has her first of the series of live shows for pop stars, the show she's judging

84
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,260
right now in the Netherlands.

85
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,660
Number one, it's time to slide on Fridays, a huge audience market share, and a show with

86
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,220
actual losers, which, you know, I enjoy very much, it's good to have a show with people

87
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,180
who compete and people who think a lot of themselves and then lose, and of course, it's

88
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:26,020
great to see winners as well, man, it's, and it's, that show, when it comes to entertainment

89
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,020
because that's all it is, that show is well put together.

90
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:35,380
Anyway, so Patricia is off, and Dexter is along with them, Dexter, now officially being

91
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,700
Christina's boyfriend, how do I know it's official, well, well, they went through the

92
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:45,700
official boyfriend girlfriend ceremony of stating so on their Facebook by setting their

93
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:51,580
in a relationship with flag to each other, so this is a big deal, is another man in my

94
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,580
house.

95
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:59,780
I woke up this morning, there he was, as Dexter, so they took along some camera equipment,

96
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:07,060
they're starting the Chrissy and Dexter show, a video short episodic, and Dexter has

97
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,900
a little production company, he does lots of video work, and I can't wait to see what

98
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,500
these kids come up with, they were outside this morning early, getting, getting footage,

99
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,220
I guess they're doing this first episode, which their pilot episode will be about their

100
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,500
trip, you know, they had the wireless mic with a cute little mic flag with a Mivio

101
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:33,980
on it and Dexter and Chrissy, oh boy, so that means I'm all alone here, just me and the animals,

102
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,380
and you chuckle heads along for the ride, it is Thursday, it's about five o'clock in the

103
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:45,260
afternoon, I've been trying to catch up a little bit on stuff on the drop and things in general,

104
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,820
and they're just really four main topics that I want to run through with you today, one of

105
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,860
them will be just the general economy, of course, the bailout, I won't dwell on that too long,

106
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:00,540
I do want to talk about some of the feedback I've been getting about from Obama supporters.

107
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:08,940
As promised, a review of the G1 Google phone, which have now had my possession for almost

108
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,740
36 hours, and of course some of us, I'm going to use it along the way, I'm not going to make this a

109
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,100
super, super long show, it shouldn't turn into the hour and a half we've been doing,

110
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,380
because I am saving things for tomorrow for an official food war Friday, since I'll also be here

111
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:28,620
by myself and let's plenty of time without distraction to eat out a food war Friday edition.

112
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,580
Saturday, of course, no agenda, Patricia is coming back on Saturday, the kids, as we call them,

113
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,980
the childrens, will be coming back on Sunday, so that's my life, how you doing?

114
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,220
Hey, so I start off with cult of personality, and a couple of reasons for that to start it off with,

115
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,860
I came back and I had already seen this, I think on my way to the airport, I was scanning through

116
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:56,540
some news, trying to get back into the UK news loop, and it's really amazing.

117
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:07,980
At the top of all news today, front page of most newspapers, if not all, top of the news,

118
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,740
and I'm not just talking top of the news, I'm talking like 10 minutes top of the news,

119
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:21,180
more important than anything else, lead story, lead story is about a radio show hosted by Russell

120
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,300
Brand. Now, he works for, he does a show, I think it's only a weekend show, I don't know if it's

121
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:33,500
a daily or a weekly show for the BBC for Radio 2. Russell Brand, of course, he hosted the MTV

122
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Music Awards, he's in that movie, something forget about Sarah, I saw it on the plane actually,

123
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,020
it's cute, it's a fun little movie. He has a radio show, and the guy is absolutely insane,

124
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:54,460
and I usually like the stuff he says, he makes me laugh, he's very quick, very witty, very abrasive,

125
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:00,220
you know what you get with this guy, and certainly the radio 2 knows what they got with this guy,

126
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,900
and along with him on this controversial, or this, it is, of course, the big Russell Brand,

127
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:11,740
Jonathan Ross controversy, so in this controversy, Jonathan Ross, who is arguably the number one

128
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,260
TV talk show host in Britain, he has this show on Friday nights, it's the show to be in,

129
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:23,340
it's all the superstar foreign guests come to see his show, I mean, it is the place to be, and he

130
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:29,420
makes an enormous amount of money by UK standards, I believe it's 6 million pounds a year, he also

131
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:36,300
does a once a week radio show on Saturdays, which is usually, it's okay, it's kind of fun, I like

132
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:43,260
his Friday night TV, his talk show better, and then he does, he's a major film buff, his wife also

133
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:50,300
writes movies, I believe, writes scripts, many, some big movies, and so he does like a movie

134
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:57,580
preview or review show, so they were on together, and they decided to call up Andrew Sachs,

135
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:04,700
he played Manuel on faulty towers, which of course is John Cleese produced the vehicle, I think

136
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:13,660
was a, I'd call it a Monte Python spin-off, and so whatever transpired in this, so they called

137
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,860
him, I believe he was supposed to be on for an interview, I'm not quite sure, but they called

138
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,940
them, they got his answering machine, and then they started goofing around leaving stupid messages

139
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,220
on his answering machine, and what they said, which I'm happy to let you hear if you can actually

140
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:33,100
sit through it, because it's actually it's boring, what they said has become the outrage to such an

141
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:40,540
extent that Russell brand has now quit his radio show, he resigned, and Jonathan Ross has been

142
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:46,620
placed on the inactive list, so normally he tapes his show on Wednesday, his television show,

143
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,900
he didn't tape it on Wednesday, we'll not air on Friday, even though they've both publicly stated

144
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:58,540
apologies, the director general of the BBC is investigating until further notice, Jonathan Ross will be

145
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:05,580
will be kept inactive, will be, what is the word I'm looking for? He gets pushed to the

146
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:11,740
bench, he's on the bench, what he is, he's benched, and there are 20 or 30,000 complaints that

147
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,100
came into the BBC, and this is a gross misuse of taxpayer funding, or actually it's licensed

148
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:24,620
fee funding, because you pay it independently of the tax system, like 151 pounds a year, and people are

149
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:30,620
just in arms, and this is like the biggest news, and I said to Patricia, how can this be? I mean,

150
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,500
there are other things going on in the world, yeah, sure, this is interesting,

151
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,700
and it's fun, and you know, they basically insulted the guy, so big deal, you know, if anything,

152
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:50,540
it was a non-funny bit, they should be benched or fired for being not funny, not for some

153
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:58,380
outrageous, you know, supposed outrageous candor, and who cares? Move on, no, you can't move on because

154
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,220
and Patricia made a very valuable point about this, you can't move on because people are so

155
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:08,220
sick and tired of hearing about Gordon Brown and about the crisis and how the house prices are

156
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,700
crashing and how people are going bankrupt and being kicked out of their homes, they're so tired

157
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,100
of hearing about it that they latched onto this, and they're just going nuts with it, and if I,

158
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,220
I will play just a little bit, and might as well, just so you can get a general idea of what this is,

159
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:29,020
it's nothing, it's, you know, it starts off with, you know, what the hell is this? Why is my,

160
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:36,780
yeah, no, now of course everything is slow to load. I'm back in the UK with zero bandwidth

161
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,180
opportunity, here we go. It's uh, there's a link in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com. I'll just

162
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,500
leave you here a little bit because actually, let me just explain that nowhere, does anyone quote

163
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,940
in these new stories, what actually, and you know, was said, and it was kind of hard to find audio,

164
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,820
I left a note on the drop, and immediately some folks sent me some links, but it's not like the

165
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,740
new stories are actually reporting what they said, but you know, whatever, was it was scandalous,

166
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,660
it was horrible. What is that just, she's also found right on the phone, but this is

167
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,620
a conventional upload something out. No, no, it's like, no, it's a family, it's a common sort of

168
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:16,140
moment that somebody's calling again, or either message, speak off the turn, thank you. So lonely,

169
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,900
when you've missed your message, enough or for more options, press one at any time, uh,

170
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,060
oh, hello, and this is Russell Brandt. I'm a great appreciate it, uh, if you'll work over

171
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,620
the decades, you're going to be on the Michelle now. Uh, I don't know why you're not

172
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,860
answering the phone, it's a bit difficult for me, we've drawn it from Russell.

173
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,780
Hello, Andrew. That's true. Basically, they're calling up to insulting about, uh,

174
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:43,020
about being on some show of, uh, uh, stars who used to be on the bill, which is a cop show here,

175
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,660
and that, you know, whether they did or did not have success after that, it's, it's a, it's a,

176
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:54,540
it's a very infantile, not funny, gag, not funny, you know, joke that they're going into.

177
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,780
Speaking now, uh, we understand, anyway, well, I can still do the interview to be honest with you.

178
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,140
Let's do it, let's do it. I think, uh, I've drawn this. I mean, Andrew Sachs,

179
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,540
do you will be appearing in a documentary, the bill might be famous with a Martin Camperon's

180
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,780
Dolchry Paula Grady Paul in Cook. Yes, they've been building my cool, those people,

181
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,700
find my Sandra Sachs. I'm a tiny, didn't I, Andrew Sachs. Well, that's Jonathan's big.

182
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,460
I'm a tiny, you, you woe to find with you, I'm telling other performances. Yes, love.

183
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,180
Guess the appearance on the bloody bill. We've, for you, it's better than for you,

184
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,540
towers than ever, and be been in the bill. I didn't know you was in here and all pulling.

185
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,500
I know very fully towers. I remember your singles. I've got all four of them. Well, they were

186
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,020
four great singles now. You know what I'm saying? It's boring, right?

187
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,220
Man Andrew Sachs. Don't call him, man. Well, that's really bad.

188
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,220
Oh, I apologize. Oh, you're sad. He's an idiot.

189
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,300
Look, Andrew Sachs, I've got respect for you and your lineage and progeny.

190
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,460
We never let that only question to hint. Oh, what do you mean? Why did that come

191
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,420
because you know what you're doing? It's fun to grind it up.

192
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:57,180
So that was the genesis of the whole thing. Russell Brand, who is a known, I think it actually

193
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,740
was a sex addict. He went to a clinic for it. He had sex with a guy's granddaughter,

194
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:07,100
whatever. And so from there, it just goes downhill. It's just dumb. It's like,

195
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:12,700
so it's total cult of personality, the society of the spectacle. And it makes total sense.

196
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,820
And I would say, let's begin to look out for this happening in the States pretty soon.

197
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,980
People, you know, there's a need for some different news and need to switch away.

198
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:27,500
And but it just kind of the fact that it's been going on for three days, just kind of amazed me.

199
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,900
You know, people are sticking their hands even deeper in the sand. At a moment when we actually

200
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:38,780
have to be kind of paying attention. So you can listen to the whole interview if you're so inclined

201
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,660
by checking out the show notes, links there at datasourcecode.com.

202
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:50,700
One other thing, there is obviously, I got to go through some bummer news. I can't help it.

203
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:56,060
I did what I just want to pay homage to and Presley. This is the news reporter who was beaten

204
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:01,100
in her home and apparently robbed. Now, this happened in, I believe, Arkansas.

205
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,260
And it's just really, really weird. The whole story is weird. How it happened, you know,

206
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:15,100
it doesn't, it's just like no information. There's no news, but she passed away, you know,

207
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:21,180
beaten the death. And I'm sure that there's been some stories here and there, but, oh, man,

208
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:30,780
it's beautiful. How did this happen? And why did this happen? And, you know, just, I don't know,

209
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:36,780
there's something about it. I have no basis what's of all other than I got a hunch that there's

210
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:42,060
a lot more behind this that went out hearing about. If it really is just a robbery, then,

211
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,540
you know, violent robbery, it just doesn't feel right. And it's a horrible shame.

212
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:57,500
All right. So I was in Los Angeles for, let me see, I was at them two, three days, two days,

213
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:03,180
three days for digital Hollywood, which was kind of interesting. It was good to be in Los Angeles.

214
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:09,020
We also have a new sales guy, Paul Mendoza, who's in charge of the Southwestern region.

215
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,820
And he's part of the Mendoza crime family, I hear. But he has a very interesting way of selling.

216
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,460
And, of course, I'm talking about ad sales. So we, you know, we hit all the media agencies and

217
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,060
it was, it's kind of vibrant in Los Angeles. A lot is happening. It feels a lot more alive when it

218
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:30,700
comes to digital and online media. Like a lot more is happening in Los Angeles than,

219
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,060
well, certainly than San Francisco. But even New York in a way, LA just seems, I have to say,

220
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,940
it seems to get it a little bit more. So I'm very bullish and very happy about that. It was also

221
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,900
kind of cool to hang out at Digital Hollywood. I'm not one who likes to do a lot of, you know,

222
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:53,500
conferences at all. I'm not really comfortable doing keynote speeches. I like, I do, I do

223
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,020
one every single, every single time I do a daily source code, I feel like I'm doing a keynote.

224
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,900
You know, I'm tired. I'm tired of talking. And nothing to say. And the things that I want to say,

225
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:07,180
people at a conference don't want to hear me talk about. But I did do this one panel, which was,

226
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:14,140
it was kind of interesting. It was about, basically, called the personality online Hollywood

227
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:22,700
gossip. I'm not, well, I was asked to be on this panel. And for a number of reasons, but just to

228
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:32,380
give you an idea was on the panel, it was Axis Hollywood, the entertainment section of Yahoo fan

229
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:41,340
cast, people magazine I think was, was represented. And the village voice, actually,

230
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,700
a bill from the village voice, it was kind of fun hanging out with him. We pretty much agreed

231
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:54,380
a lot of things. But it was just amazing, you know, how seriously people take that stuff,

232
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,860
that there's a whole panel about it, essentially. I just, after about a half an hour, it's like,

233
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,580
I just got started messing with this. I just got so tired of it. You know, what are the,

234
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,860
what are the boundaries and how far should we go? Like, what are you talking about?

235
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:13,180
So, there was no one, no one has any scruples. You know, these, these children who are

236
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:18,620
celebrities are being misused. And nothing new, by the way, Judy Garland was given pills by the

237
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,700
studio, pills to go to bed, pills to get up and make another movie, shut up, bitch and work.

238
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:29,660
You know, this is nothing new, surprise surprise. Hollywood is fake. The movies are fake.

239
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:38,620
Television is fake, duh. Please. It was fun. I ran into people who hadn't seen it like

240
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:46,700
14 or 15 years, including Daniel Paul, who worked at Apple way back in the day. And he

241
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:52,300
hooked me up with the first Apple had a program where they'd hand out loaner computers to people

242
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,380
of immediate influence. And that's when I got my first Apple, too. That's how far back we go.

243
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,340
And actually had to send it back. That was, it was the program. You get your Apple, too. And then

244
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,900
after, you know, like two years, you had to send it back to them, which I diligently did by then,

245
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,780
you know, I had already, I was already in a buying like power book, one, 40, or the, the duo,

246
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:20,380
doc, 230. Remember that one? I'm a Mac with a gigantic, like a big floppy drive. Oh boy, good times.

247
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,740
So that was, that was okay. And there were some people who actually had some pretty interesting

248
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:32,780
content that they were trying to get distributed. So yeah, all in all, not too bad. And

249
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,420
the end of, as I said, even the sales calls. Because, you know, we got to, we got to really

250
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:43,180
move it. We made a very conscious decision. Of course, we were, we had some foresight about the economic

251
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:47,180
downturn, duh. You listen to this show. You know, we had some foresight. And that's why we,

252
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:52,380
we were reorganized early on several months ago. You remember that? We changed, you know,

253
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,100
that's around the time we changed our name from Pod Show to me, Vio. And we also raised the

254
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,180
additional money. We knew that this was coming. We knew what would be necessary. And so,

255
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:06,060
you know, we're in a reasonably good spot to really put the, the pedal to the metal. And hammer

256
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:11,820
the acceleration, you know, while other people are, and other companies are having issues and

257
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,660
having trouble. Now, we might be able to pull ahead. And we're all working very, very hard. And of

258
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:24,140
course, that includes the entrance of the new member of our management team, Jeff Carp, who joined

259
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,780
us from Electronic Arts. We haven't done an official press release about it yet. I have quite

260
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,820
honestly just going to be a bit of crazy busy. And, you know, we were just working.

261
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:41,500
Jeff, we recruited him right out of Electronic Arts. He was for eight years. He's been there. He was

262
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,900
the head of all North American marketing for all their games. So, if you ever saw commercial,

263
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:55,340
or, or we're turned on to any EA game, Jeff Carp was responsible for it. Well, let's call it

264
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:01,340
accountable. He uses words like that. So, we are getting our shit together. I'm very happy about it.

265
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:08,380
That's, that's basically that. So, I quite sure when I'm going back, but we'll probably hit New York,

266
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,740
you know, as again, you know, just out there, drawing up sales, got to make it work. We,

267
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,540
we have a small company, challenging times, but got to push forward, got to move forward, got to work

268
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:26,220
really hard. And again, it's, you can see that it's tough out there. There's a lot of, a lot of

269
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:32,220
companies running into trouble, which is unfortunate, but it's the reality. Call it a version of

270
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:39,900
main street. You're witnessing it before your very eyes. Okay. Some feedback coming in through the

271
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,900
drop. Remember, you can leave your voicemail comments there. There is a voicemail number with,

272
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,900
you can always find that in the, in the show notes, curie.com, or crossposts at DennySourceco.com.

273
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,620
If you use a paid number, but then you can leave a voicemail on the drop. Or you can upload an MP3 file.

274
00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:02,780
That's fine, too. I'm, I'm, I'm going to be kidding me, PSC and Hammer Smith. The secret, you want to know

275
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:09,820
what the secret is. The secret is, they got suckers like you to buy that book. Oh, man, come on.

276
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:16,060
That's the problem with the world today. People expect to get everything just by thinking

277
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:21,660
about it and not working for it. Now, I got a number of comments about this. This, of course,

278
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:28,460
referring to the last portion of Daily Source Code episode 800, the previous show, where I discussed

279
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:34,140
the book, The Secret. And a lot of people really misinterpreted what I was saying about that.

280
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:41,180
Of course, it's ludicrous to think that you can just think happy thoughts and be positive.

281
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,580
And then have the world be your oyster and everything show up exactly when you need it, how you

282
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:52,300
need it and exactly get to your specifications. Obviously not. And I only,

283
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,220
really highlighted this book because it does pull together a number of things that I've come to learn

284
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:04,460
throughout life and do believe, absolutely, if influenced the course of my life. I didn't

285
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,100
come from money. I didn't come from success. I didn't come from, in fact, my family of anything

286
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:17,820
are a bunch of robots for the government. We're all government issue, worked in various levels

287
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:26,060
of the military and politics. You know, absolutely assimilated. I've never been a part of that.

288
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:32,620
I've broken free of that very early on. And I've lived the life that has my own life,

289
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:38,620
which is taken its own course, but by focusing, by thinking about things, is usually when you start

290
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:45,580
driving towards them and make them happen. And I disagree. The book does not tell you that you

291
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:50,940
can get whatever you want just by thinking about it. It doesn't sound like a lot of people actually

292
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:59,420
read the book. But again, it's not a solution. It is just a part of a toolkit that you do need to

293
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:06,060
become successful. And it's worked for me. That was my point. Man, people really took it the wrong way.

294
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,380
I'm surprised, honestly. I had a work. Which, of course, means I didn't communicate it properly.

295
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,980
What we want, we have to say. And I think it's quite obvious. I work very hard for what I want.

296
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:22,700
And what I want is not just from me. It's for all the people in my companies and it's for the

297
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:29,340
community of listeners and it's for my child and all the children of the world. That's what I want.

298
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:35,260
Not from me. I don't give a shit about me. I really don't. And of course, you got to work. That's

299
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:42,380
the whole point. But focus and it all comes a lot easier. You get perspective. It all makes logical sense.

300
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:49,180
For what we want. Don't save up any money to buy that book. Don't save up people. Don't waste any

301
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:57,660
money to buy that. Don't watch the DVD. Oh, man. What a waste. Love date, hundred. Love to show.

302
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,740
Keep it going, man. You almost had it up until the end. That's not a secret, dude.

303
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:09,980
That's the power of. I don't want to work for what I want. I just want to think about it and get it.

304
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:16,780
No, no, no. That would be what we're about to receive from our new president. That's what

305
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,180
that's all about. That's the big secret there. We'll be talking about that more without a doubt

306
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,740
because there was lots of feedback from, I guess about how much supporters, but maybe just

307
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,980
people who misunderstand my position on that as well. I'm all about work. I'm all about creating

308
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:41,420
opportunity, creating jobs, creating wealth, not for myself, but wealth among a smaller

309
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:49,260
community. We got 50, 60 employees and providing them with things like, oh, crazy shit.

310
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:56,700
What is it? Oh, yeah. Health benefits. Yeah. That kind of stuff. I'm not doing it because

311
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:02,540
I get nothing better to do. It's what I do. It's what I enjoy doing.

312
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:10,620
Then when I put my mind to it and when everyone in the company is aligned, things really accelerate.

313
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:16,620
Things start to happen. Good things start to happen. That's why the whole title of the book,

314
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,540
the secret is kind of a farce to start with. It's no secret. It's logical.

315
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,460
But to take it like, I haven't seen a DVD. Maybe the DVD puts it in a wrong perspective,

316
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,980
but reading the book. I was like, didn't seem like it was telling me all I had to do was

317
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:40,460
did it home and dream. Although we can hope for change. That's the big secret, I guess.

318
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:47,340
That's a problem. That's the whole problem with the world today. Everybody just wants it. They

319
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:52,700
don't want to work for it. They don't want to have to save up for it. They just want it now.

320
00:29:52,700 --> 00:30:02,700
I loved everything about the show up until the end. I got to say that was a real disappointment.

321
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,940
I see where the oil is going. I see where the cold is going. Maybe they're trying to bankrupt the

322
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:15,420
Saudis now. That'd be an interesting thing. The first time. Get the Saudis all worried. If you

323
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,980
noticed on the news, they're pumping 2.5 billion into their banks today.

324
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:28,060
And still going the way of the corporation. It's still going the way of the big brother. We got to

325
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:34,460
look at that and we got to analyze how do you fight a corporation? When the only way you can

326
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:40,140
make money is through the corporation, the only way you can survive is to make money. We can't

327
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:48,540
buy our own food. They're outlawing that with one cento. Tell the show, keep them talking.

328
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,620
Do you see an hammer's mess? Hopefully he had him back to Oregon this week.

329
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:02,940
Take it easy. I'm in. Thank you, he's. I really think you misunderstood me. I really think you did.

330
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:09,420
Although listening to your comment and just thinking about the words hope and change, it does

331
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:15,180
really seem like there is a mass mania of food where we're just hoping stuff will get better and

332
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:21,260
we think we deserve change. But yeah, again, you're right in that regard. We absolutely don't

333
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:26,780
seem to want to work for it because it's being spoon fed to us. And that's not just in the states.

334
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:32,060
That's that's global. That's absolutely worldwide. And I've and I look and I live in a society where

335
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,620
it takes place right now in the United Kingdom. So there's no escaping it. But I'm also,

336
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:41,020
I'm I'm planning a melody out of it. I'm getting I'm I just have to become a little more

337
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,620
laid back about all of this. There's not much that can be done. We'll have four years now. And this

338
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:53,500
absolutely one of the reasons why I hope Barack Obama is elected president so that we can follow

339
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:59,660
along. And I can continue to say, oh, well, gee, is that really unexpected or is this what you

340
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:05,420
really wanted? Is this what you voted for? Is this what you think was the promise? Because that is my

341
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:12,540
feeling. You know, we're we're really being lied to and we're being snow jobbed into this.

342
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,820
Yeah, I'm more about that in a bit. So anyway, the secret itself, the book is more about positive

343
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:26,060
thinking, the power of the of the conscious and unconscious mind about focus, about how you can

344
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:32,220
change your inner feelings and an instant. And yes, indeed, about the things that have not been

345
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:39,660
proven and almost go against all laws of physics, you know, energy, magnetism, amongst beings.

346
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:44,940
You know, I believe in a lot of that stuff. But I never intended anyone to believe that they

347
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,580
can just sit there and hope for good things and the change will come. Oops, I'm sorry. That is

348
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:58,540
there you go. It doesn't actually work that way. You just said it. Okay. So there's not much to say,

349
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:03,180
you know, there's not a lot of news about the general finances that I want to get, you know, the

350
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:11,740
bailout and everything that that is going on right now, other than holy crap. It's all over the

351
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:20,780
math and it just seems like all of the predictions are coming true. You know, the dollar will eventually

352
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:30,860
get hammered. It can't stop. You know, the banks have taken our money, are 700 billion,

353
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:36,380
another 150 billion went to other stuff. That nothing to do with the bailout, but that's how they got

354
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:43,660
it passed. And so they're going to use that money to acquire other banks and not actually pass it on.

355
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:51,340
You know, the now the the borrowing rate for banks is, you know, the the the the primary

356
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:56,220
rate was just caught. It's 1% now. I still if you go into a bank and you want a mortgage,

357
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:02,300
you're looking at seven or eight percent. I don't see any really cheap. If you're talking

358
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,900
a long term, not an adjustable rate mortgage or a long term mortgage is incredibly high.

359
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:15,580
Interbank lending, that means the the banks lending to each other is three and a half times the

360
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:23,900
going rate. It just makes no sense. I'm not an economist, but when you understand the very basic

361
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,060
principles and if you don't, you need to need to learn about it. You need to pick up a book.

362
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:32,940
You should be able to pick up a junior high school book and learn about it. You'll see that

363
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,940
what they're doing just makes no sense. And whatever they think it's doing,

364
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:42,380
it's definitely not getting money moving in the economy. Other than we're being encouraged to

365
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:47,500
shop more and buy stuff on credit cards. And I saw a report on CNBC this morning that

366
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,500
people are now using credit cards in more places than they used to. The the in fact the number one

367
00:34:53,500 --> 00:35:01,580
check this out. The number one use of credit cards today, the retail level, is it McDonald's.

368
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:07,740
People are buying the McDonald's with credit cards. I can't tell you that that's just scary.

369
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:13,980
You have to believe it. No, so I would guess people don't actually have the money.

370
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:20,060
So they're buying their McDonald's, which is not exactly the healthiest food to be eaten too much.

371
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:27,420
They're buying it on credit. So it seems to me like we're in a pretty dire straight right now.

372
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:35,660
So the European Union has been looking at E money as we call it because of course

373
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:40,940
that's the next step is you know take it from credit cards into

374
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:49,660
really electronic wallets, you know money that they you load up onto a card or

375
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:55,260
very much like the the transport cards. Now the European Union is doing a lot with this. They

376
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:02,300
have an E money directive and there was a whole review process of what industry fell to the

377
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:08,060
banks felt and there's a PDF you might want to peruse that of course also in the show notes linked

378
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:17,100
through. It's really quite interesting because essentially when everything is E money and there's no

379
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,940
more paper this is the move from paper to plastic. You're going to hear you're going to hear a lot of

380
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,580
that paper to plastic which of course is kind of a play on the whole plastic or paper or what

381
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:30,700
kind of bagged you want it when you're checking out the supermarket. You can hear this term

382
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:36,220
moving from paper to plastic meaning moving from money that's printed into the easiest form of

383
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:42,620
money creation stuff that just exists in a spreadsheet and it looks like the European Union is pretty

384
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:53,660
set up. They have four what do they call them? Let me see. Electronic money institutions they call them

385
00:36:53,660 --> 00:37:05,340
EMDs and electronic money institution ELMIs and these are these are companies that essentially

386
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:10,220
will be keeping the money in a database on a spreadsheet. I mean the implications of this are pretty

387
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:18,220
big because you know then it becomes so much easier just to say okay if you have X amount on deposit

388
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:23,020
you can lend out 10 times that it's the same thing it's it's just a continuation of the problem

389
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:28,940
we have with central banking only it feels well more like we would be bringing it or reserve lending

390
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:36,940
I should say we'll be bringing it one step closer to to infinity MPH had all coordinated that

391
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:46,780
trying to do this across Europe. It's pretty crazy. Let me see you got another phone call here

392
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:53,100
I want to share with you. This was funny. Hello Mr. Curry it's Brent from Tampa Florida you know

393
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:59,180
every day I turn on the news with an unsfox MSNBC CNN local affiliates whatever they're always

394
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:04,860
talking about how terrible things are. I hate to break the news to you but there's probably 75 to 80

395
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:09,820
percent of us out here in United States they're doing just fine. We're not behind in our house payments

396
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,860
we're not behind in our car payments we're still spending lots of money. I go out once you twice a week

397
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:21,660
I spend 75 to 100 bucks every time I go out I just bought a brand new motorcycle I'm not behind

398
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:27,180
on any payments at all and paying my credit cards off and I'd say for the most part most of us out

399
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:34,460
there are probably in that same seat so when you talk about how terrible things are you're actually

400
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:39,980
brainwarsing a lot of people into failure. I mean look at kids in school when they go to school

401
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:45,580
and they're surrounded by people that give them a lot of good feedback they tend to do better in

402
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:51,020
school but if you're in a bad school and people say oh you'll never make it you'll never make it in

403
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:57,020
life you're just doomed for failure chances are you're gonna fail so how about every once in a while

404
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:02,620
in the DSC putting out a good story putting out something that talks about the good things that are

405
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:08,060
happening in life because there's more of us out there than not that are doing just fine take care

406
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:15,020
my phone or see you later you think that do you speak about all that who am I kidding we're just as

407
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:21,580
screwed as the next guy hey that's what's that YouTube video what do you think uh then this goes in this

408
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:29,020
whole whole thing about death collectors yeah it's kind of funny yeah yeah it's you know I just keep

409
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:37,260
your eye on it as a DSC in Oregon said currently and wherever the hell he was you know we

410
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:44,620
we got to take care of our own and just keep your eye on the ball and follow the money

411
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:50,060
because it's your money it's being taken away it's being uh now we're gonna give it to

412
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:57,980
um oh we're gonna give it to we're gonna give it to the auto industry but instead of doing something

413
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:04,060
well so here's it just one quick thing about this and all and I'll move on is it amazing that the

414
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:10,140
US auto industry is collapsing they're a standing at the government store saying you have to give

415
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:15,580
us money we're too big to fail wherever that before we're too big to fail because we've got uh hundreds

416
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:21,740
of thousands of jobs that depend upon the auto industry for what I understand almost 17% of

417
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:27,820
all retail purchases in the United States is based on the the car industry so it's not just uh

418
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:34,460
the manufacturers but it's the parts it's the the showrooms sales etc so these guys are dying on the

419
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:40,460
vine uh looking for billions of dollars from the government that's your money in my money and if it's

420
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:45,500
not then it's being printed which which which really takes away from the value of your money in mine

421
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:53,420
if you if you have US dollars um and the oil companies the drug dealers the true drug dealers of

422
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:59,420
of the of the universe are posting record profits uh exon mobile today 16 billion in profits for

423
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:04,220
the quarter so why don't we you know considering that one billion dollars of bailout money for the

424
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:09,740
auto industry equals 30,000 jobs what why doesn't exon mobile step up to the plate you know make

425
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:15,020
them give those guys 10 billion make all the top three oil companies give them 10 billions they

426
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:21,660
got 30 billion that would create a nice hunk of jobs or maintain them save them and the caveat

427
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:29,180
is that this is only for uh new technologies uh like the plug-in hybrid electric and I'm not talking

428
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:35,180
about you know the 150 miles per gallon which is crazy I was looking at the Obama campaign uh

429
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:42,700
uh they talk about a plug-in hybrid that gets 150 miles to the gallon well if it's a plug-in what

430
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:48,300
is it have to be a hybrid and you know 150 miles to the gallon gallon of what it's a plug-in

431
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,980
you know it should it should be plug-in or a hybrid I think there's two different things there

432
00:41:53,980 --> 00:42:00,060
because if it's a hybrid then doesn't necessarily plug-in it can recharge from from the motion of the engine

433
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:07,500
that's what the uh what the preest does anyway I'm moving off topic why don't we have the oil

434
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,700
companies who are you know always oh yes we're investing in future energy and future technologies

435
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,460
having really stuff up to the plate haven't given 10 you know have exon mobile give away 10

436
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:22,220
billion of the 16 billion uh to the car companies um to new subsidiaries so that they can go and

437
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:27,100
create you know real new cars or you could consider not bailing out the oldest establishment

438
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,740
but growing a new one you know these new companies like Tesla even though they you know they're

439
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:38,060
making a stupid car it's you know it's a sports car it's like not meant that's not that's a niche market

440
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:43,980
you know make something useful and you and make it as cheap as possible and uh incentivize those

441
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:52,620
exhaust guys new new people new entrepreneurs new companies do that you know so now the incentive is no no

442
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,780
we're just going to continue making what we were making we're going to try and bail out and be

443
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:02,460
get the bail out and continue along the status quo these are the things that just don't make sense

444
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:08,700
to me and what will be next what will the next industry be that is too big to fail because of the

445
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:16,380
jobs meanwhile the true R&D the true entrepreneurialism in the United States which a lot of that

446
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:23,900
I feel is in uh in uh in uh high technology uh they're laying off left and right big companies

447
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:30,460
laying off uh 10,000 people at a time so if three companies lay off 10,000 people that's 30,000

448
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:36,140
that's a billion dollars that they should be whining at the government force saying oh please help

449
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:40,780
bail us out this has always been my problem chucklehead this is not the way the United States is

450
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:47,340
supposed to work it really isn't it's not a big business is 25% of what goes on in the

451
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:52,060
States business wise the rest is small and medium business we're helping the wrong people we're

452
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,900
giving them our money and if we're not giving them our money then we're printing it which is

453
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:02,620
devaluing our current money this is what's so wrong and both candidates voted for it

454
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:10,060
Barack Obama and John McCain both skewges for Wall Street voted for the bailout

455
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:41,180
shopping every Sunday at the moment oh everyone's more I love more than we have it all

456
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:50,380
so take me to the new show you can you hear the rain and make sure you want to see

And make sure you want to see

462
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,460
It's such a beautiful day

463
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,460
But yeah

464
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,460
Yeah, I'm so tired of the wings

465
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,460
But I have been missing wings

466
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,460
You little like a king

467
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,460
Well, lots of money and things

468
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,460
Let's wear

469
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:06,460
Baby burn your pocket

470
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:11,460
Oh, yeah

471
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,460
Oh, yeah

472
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,460
Oh, yeah, yeah

473
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:21,460
Deep deeper in your wallet

474
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:25,460
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

475
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:29,460
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

476
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,460
So take me to the new store

477
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,460
You can't you hear the rain

478
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,460
It makes you want to see

479
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,460
It's such a beautiful day

480
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,460
It's such a beautiful day

481
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,460
I'm so tired of the wings

482
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,460
But I have been missing wings

483
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,460
You little like a king

484
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:58,460
Shinaya Twain

485
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,460
I gotta tell you, I kind of

486
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:05,460
Didn't follow Shinaya Twain since I feel like a woman

487
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:09,460
This was left on the drop of drop.au slash daily source code

488
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,460
And it made total sense

489
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,460
That's right

490
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,460
So the change

491
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,460
The way the system works

492
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,460
Just change it at the bottom

493
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,460
That's how we got to do

494
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,460
Save your money

495
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,460
Keep it in cash

496
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,460
I know right now

497
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,460
It feels crazy

498
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,460
If you're looking at your retirement plans

499
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,460
If you're in the United States

500
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,460
You have a 401k perhaps

501
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:32,460
It works different in many different countries

502
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,460
But in the States, it's very cultural

503
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,460
To look at what your 401k is invested in

504
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,460
My personal recommendation would not be to sell

505
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,460
Leave it in there

506
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,460
If you can, which means you basically have to leave it in there

507
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,460
For the next 10 years

508
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,460
But that will improve you

509
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,460
If you're retiring now

510
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,460
You're getting screwed

511
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,460
Hate that's hate to say it

512
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,460
And I know plenty of people who are

513
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,460
See if you can only take out a little bit of your 401k

514
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,460
See if you can

515
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,460
See what you can change

516
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,460
Because you're going to have to do it

517
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,460
Because it's going to be quite a while before the value was back

518
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,460
But selling getting out now

519
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:07,460
Trying to reinvest in something not a good idea

520
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,460
I can't believe it's already like 50 minutes

521
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,460
I got a boogie along with a couple things here

522
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,460
God bless Ireland, man

523
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,460
They were so right when they voted

524
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,460
I was the only country in the European Union

525
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,460
Allowed a referendum

526
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,460
Permitted a referendum about the Lisbon Treaty

527
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:30,460
Because now, as we see in these Sunday times

528
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:34,460
Here in the United Kingdom, John Hutton, the minister of defense

529
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,460
Or the United K

530
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,460
United of K

531
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,460
He's the Secretary

532
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,460
Secretary defense

533
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,460
He's backing a French plan for a European army

534
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,460
Branding those who dismiss it as pathetic

535
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,460
In a wide ranging interview with the Sunday Times

536
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:55,460
He said, I think we've got to be pragmatic about those things

537
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,460
Where it can help we should be part of it

538
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,460
His support goes beyond the public position of Gordon Brown

539
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,460
The prime minister and will antagonize those who believe that

540
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,460
Further European cooperation will undermine NATO by excluding the United

541
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,460
States

542
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,460
Yet bloody, bloody, blah, the whole point was

543
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:12,460
Why do we need a European army now?

544
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,460
Nicholas Sarkozy, the French president, has sought to develop

545
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:19,460
Europe's military structures with new headquarters and rapid reaction forces

546
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,460
Each consisting of 1,500 troops from member countries

547
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,460
It's not a big military, but it's a start

548
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,460
And Hutton, the defense secretary of the UK, said

549
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:31,460
France is one of our closest allies militarily

550
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,460
The French believe very strongly in this type of role

551
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,460
If we can support it, we should

552
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,460
Any added that working with the EU allies

553
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,460
And military missions was perfectly sensible

554
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:48,460
I think we need less army, I'm all for less military

555
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:54,460
And why now do we have to sit like schmocks in between the United States and Russia

556
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,460
Essentially, and we'll have our own little army

557
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:05,460
Oh man, that's exactly what the Irish word about

558
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:10,460
They word about the tax situation, but they primarily word about a global European army

559
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,460
I said, no, no, no, it's not going to happen and here it is

560
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:14,460
Well, this is a good idea, let's go and do it

561
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:18,460
It's being driven by Sarkozy, European army, what's next?

562
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,460
Hi, Adam, it's Matt from Game's Weasel on this week's show

563
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,460
We Review Pro Evolution Soccer 2009

564
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,460
Give Spore a quick spin on the PC

565
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:36,460
Some free runners tell us about the new parkour action game Mirrors Edge

566
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:40,460
And you can win a copy of Fallout 3 and the Shining New Playstation 3

567
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:43,460
To play it on, that's all against Weasel.com

568
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,460
Yeah, gamesweasel.com

569
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,460
That show kicks ass, I love what Matt Cuttle does on that show

570
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,460
And I've never been a gamer, I don't own a game console

571
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,460
But I really don't enjoy what I'm seeing

572
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,460
Then some of these things look really awesome

573
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:00,460
And you know, Jeff Carpin, we've got an injection of

574
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:04,460
Game culture into the company, it's kind of exciting

575
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,460
I guess we'll have to break down in the new pad

576
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,460
By the way, we are moving, we got a new place

577
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,460
Haven't named it yet

578
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:12,460
I don't know if it's going to be like the Curry Terrace

579
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,460
Because it is on it is a terrace house

580
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,460
It's on a square, maybe called the Curry Square

581
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,460
Haven't quite figured that one out

582
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,460
I don't think there's any curry corner

583
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:23,460
There is somewhat a little iteration to be had

584
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,460
The Curry Corner

585
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,460
The Curry Corner Casa

586
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:31,460
Anyway, yeah, before like some before the end of the year

587
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,460
We'll be moved out so

588
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,460
Holy crap

589
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,460
Got a lot to do, a lot to pack

590
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,460
Going down under for a couple of stories

591
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,460
You know, Australia, this guy has been around before

592
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,460
And I believe this, I don't know how old this news piece is

593
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,460
I'll fire it up here

594
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,460
Maybe I can see when it was posted on YouTube

595
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,460
But there is some very, yeah, 13th of February, 2008

596
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,460
Very encouraging

597
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,460
Very encouraging news about energy

598
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,460
And I've been following these guys

599
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,460
People who make generators

600
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,460
With magnetic pole

601
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:07,460
So they're using the attractiveness

602
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,460
And the rejection of magnets

603
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:12,460
Depending on if you have the north

604
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,460
The south pole of the magnet

605
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:18,460
Focus on each other or north north or south south

606
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,460
There could be a pole or a rejection

607
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,460
A force

608
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,460
And just in a nutshell

609
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:27,460
I'm going to play a little piece of this

610
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,460
This news piece from Sky News in Australia

611
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:34,460
The whole concept is you get the generator going

612
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,460
By using a very low power source like a battery

613
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,460
And then once it's running

614
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:45,460
I've seen in some cases people actually disconnect the original power source

615
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,460
And then it becomes something that I've grown up to know

616
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:52,460
As impossible it becomes a virtually a

617
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,460
Was that calling San Francisco office

618
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,460
A perpetual motion machine

619
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,460
Which is highly unbelievable as is for many

620
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,460
But also if you keep the battery connected

621
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,460
It outputs five times the power that you're putting in

622
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,460
Which is also said to be impossible

623
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:14,460
And these guys, it seems like they really got the real deal

624
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,460
I mean this is a mainstream news report

625
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,460
It's not bullshit

626
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,460
So I'm presuming they're reporting to some degree in a proper manner

627
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:24,460
And everyone seems to agree these guys have it

628
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,460
And it can power a whole house

629
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,460
So I'll play a little bit of the clip you like it

630
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:33,460
I dare and imagine a machine that could power your house for free

631
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:37,460
Well, that's exactly what two Australian inventors claim they've developed

632
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,460
Using magnets and a battery

633
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,460
Their new generator has been described as revolutionary

634
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:45,460
And find investors aligning up for a piece of the action

635
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,460
Chris Allen reports

636
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,460
So John, this is the machine

637
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,460
Yes, this is it Chris

638
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,460
What's the capable of?

639
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:56,460
A little power house, this will the machine will provide sufficient electricity

640
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,460
To run a house and have power doing

641
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,460
It sounds good to be true

642
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:05,460
But inventor John Christie is convinced his machine will change the world

643
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:10,460
So John, basically you're saying this machine can produce five times as much power as it can see it

644
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,460
Yes, it does

645
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,460
This one is exactly as we see it

646
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,460
It does and in fact it can produce more than that

647
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:27,460
Once Kickstarter from a battery John and his partner Lou Brits say this prototype will run for years without stopping

648
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:30,460
Generating 24 kilowatts of power a day

649
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,460
You don't get more revolutionary

650
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:39,460
I think I mean we've talking about something that has the capacity to change the way that the world produces its electric power

651
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:44,460
There's a capacity to change the way that motors cars are propelled

652
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,460
You can replace the combustion engine impact

653
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:51,460
John, these are big claims that you sure you can live up to them

654
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,460
We don't really need to live up to them, Chris

655
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:57,460
What the technology speaks for itself

656
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,460
I mean a household could buy one of these machines and install it in his garage

657
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:05,460
And power is house forever, they're buying another kilowatt from a retailer

658
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,460
I mean that's how serious it is

659
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,460
Steve Bratsington is an interesting choice of words

660
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,460
That's how serious it is

661
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,460
It's almost as if it's a bad thing

662
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:16,460
So you could buy this, it'll run for a couple of years

663
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,460
It'll power your whole house, you don't have to buy energy from an outside supplier

664
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,460
That's how serious this is

665
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:24,460
Well, isn't that like a good thing?

666
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:27,460
You would depend on electrical engineer

667
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:31,460
He's seen the machine and backs up everything John says

668
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,460
It's revolutionary

669
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,460
That's the only way to describe it

670
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,460
I think the technology

671
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:40,460
It's not bending physics, it's just using principles

672
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:44,460
That I guess are commonly used in power generation today

673
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,460
In a different way

674
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:48,460
These guys have thought outside of this way

675
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,460
Basically it's magnetic attraction and magnetic repulsion

676
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:55,460
That provide the movement or the moment of the motor

677
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:59,460
Can you understand why some scientists are skeptical about it?

678
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,460
There is no physicist or engineer

679
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:08,460
Who is looked at our motor or has looked at our figures

680
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,460
Who says it doesn't work

681
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,460
Yeah

682
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:14,460
So take a look at the whole video, it's pretty amazing

683
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,460
The thing absolutely looks cool

684
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:22,460
But I wouldn't mind filling up the drop with some information

685
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,460
On this technology, other people into it

686
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:28,460
And let's try and keep these guys alive

687
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,460
They're clearly under some things

688
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,460
We should at least give them that

689
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,460
We should protect them

690
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,460
If this stuff really works

691
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,460
Because man, there's going to be a lot of people really pissed off

692
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,460
As this catches on

693
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:42,460
Hey Adam, this is a former calling from Brisbane in Australia

694
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,460
I just wanted to call and let you

695
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,460
And the idea is, listen, there's no bad in the vent

696
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,460
Coming up soon called

697
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,460
My Vemba

698
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,460
Basically, we went around Australia

699
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,460
In the world of growing pistaches

700
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:57,460
During our Vemba to raise money to help raise awareness

701
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,460
Okay, it took me a little while

702
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,460
The tune into the accent

703
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,460
But so this is a plea

704
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,460
To support MoVend

705
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,460
No Vemba with a mic

706
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,460
MoVemba during the month of November

707
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:10,460
By growing a moustache

708
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,460
Perfect for the chakra heads out there

709
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,460
Upload your pictures to the drop

710
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,460
All the men's health issues

711
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:19,460
In Australia, the money will be donated

712
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,460
To the post-ite cancer foundation

713
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,460
All the Australia

714
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:24,460
And a company called Beyond Blue

715
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:27,460
Which is Australia's national depression

716
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,460
Initiatives

717
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,460
The funds will be used for the research

718
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,460
And increase support networks

719
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:36,460
For those men who suffer from prostate cancer

720
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:37,460
And depression

721
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:41,460
The sponsor, people can donate

722
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,460
Paypal, credit card or a checkfire

723
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,460
Slowmail

724
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:49,460
I guess paypal is probably the easiest for most people

725
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,460
I would appreciate any support

726
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:54,460
The chuckle heads can give in the form of sponsorships

727
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,460
We've also sent you an email with URL link

728
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,460
To help my moust

729
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,460
I don't have any pictures posted yet

730
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,460
As it does follow me

731
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,460
First of November

732
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,460
My current aim is to grow a nice clean little

733
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,460
80s porn star

734
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,460
I'll see how that plays

735
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,460
May it's thanks for Charlie

736
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:16,460
I normally listen to while driving towards the morning

737
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,460
And I think your recent long-shows are great

738
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,460
All right, thank you

739
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,460
All right, thank you

740
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,460
All right, good luck with that

741
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,460
Yeah, the call is out all the chuckle heads

742
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,460
There's a lot of stuff going on in Australia actually

743
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:32,460
I've mentioned before that they're talking about some pretty

744
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,460
Strange and internet filtering

745
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:38,460
And it looks like it's like it's really happening

746
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,460
This is from the Harold Sun

747
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:43,460
Which is mainstream publication in Australia

748
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,460
Australia, I'm reading verbatim

749
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,460
Australia will join China

750
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,460
In implementing mandatory censoring of the internet

751
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,460
Under plans put forward by the federal government

752
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:57,460
The revelations emerge as US tech giants

753
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:58,460
Google Microsoft and Yahoo

754
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:00,460
And a coalition of human rights and other groups

755
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:03,460
Unveiled a code of conduct aimed at safeguarding online

756
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,460
Freedom of speech and privacy

757
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:09,460
Well, we know that that only comes down to whatever they

758
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,460
Broker with the government

759
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:13,460
I mean they all have deals with the Chinese government

760
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:17,460
But it seems to be pretty far reaching

761
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:22,460
And of course this is to quote, protect the freedom and expression

762
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,460
And privacy rights of users

763
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:29,460
Yet they're talking about mandatory blocking

764
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,460
Where possible of illegal material

765
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,460
And this is where it gets kind of tricky

766
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:38,460
And I'm not quite sure what is legal and illegal in Australia

767
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:44,460
But they're classified here

768
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:50,460
Okay, if a board member Colin Jacob said it would have little effect

769
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,460
On illegal internet content

770
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:56,460
And here's the description of it including child pornography

771
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:02,460
Of course, you don't want child pornography

772
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,460
But they're expanding it now

773
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,460
And I'll tell you exactly

774
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:09,460
I can't find it now

775
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,460
Somewhere in this article

776
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:18,460
They actually talk about hardcore pornography

777
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:21,460
So they're taking it from child pornography to hardcore

778
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,460
And you could tell me it's just that it's semantics

779
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,460
But it's not, you know there is a difference

780
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,460
There's an absolute difference between those two

781
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,460
And so you know what is next

782
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,460
What kind of pornography will be illegal

783
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,460
Not now we're determining

784
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,460
Down to that level

785
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:41,460
It seems a little bit scary to me

786
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:44,460
And they're going to do this with filtering at the head end

787
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,460
And once the filter is in

788
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:46,460
Oh, here we go

789
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:50,460
The plan was first created as a way to combat child pornography

790
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:53,460
And and adult content

791
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,460
Okay, so what does that mean?

792
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,460
If we want adult content we have to buy it

793
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:01,460
It could be extended to include controversial websites

794
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:04,460
On youth in Asia or anorexia

795
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:08,460
Now of course, I'm not for a lot of what is going on

796
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:12,460
And these areas but this is really going to shut down free speech

797
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,460
And if the government can determine what is illegal

798
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:18,460
Then you know, when is the show becoming illegal

799
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:20,460
It won't take that long, believe me

800
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:22,460
Because it'll be negative sentiment

801
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:26,460
Or maybe because I'm depressing people or whatever it is

802
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:31,460
So Australia keeps sending in information

803
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:35,460
Drop that stuff at drop.io slash daily source code

804
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,460
We got to stay up to speed on what's happening

805
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,460
Because it looks like it's going to take place down under first and foremost

806
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:43,460
And if there are other countries around the world where this is happening

807
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:46,460
Which by the way, probably includes the United Kingdom

808
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,460
But not to this extent

809
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,460
Stay in touch

810
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:57,460
The great wall, the great firewall of China extending now to down under

811
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,460
And Australia

812
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:05,460
All goes to prove the point Jarvis Galker needs to make

813
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,460
You want to know who really wants the world

814
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,460
Jarvis has the answer

815
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,460
Would you hear?

816
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,460
Listen, not true, don't

817
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,460
Those was decided

818
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:18,460
We'll end up with the most

819
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:21,460
That the cream cannot help

820
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:24,460
But always rise up to the top

821
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,460
But I say

822
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,460
Shit flow

823
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:33,460
If something's too much

824
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,460
Friends, you're the same again

825
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:43,460
But we're not, we're the fewest ever

826
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:49,460
Comes us to world in the world

827
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:54,460
Comes us to world in the world

828
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:08,460
Now we work in classes

829
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:10,460
All the soly

830
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:15,460
They are so close to society as they can see

831
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:20,460
So let them all kill each other

832
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:23,460
And get a baby

833
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,460
We see

834
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:29,460
That's the way, don't you know

835
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:34,460
From the guys that's run into the show

836
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:39,460
Let's be mad, like my head wants to kill

837
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,460
Come on, come on, come on, come on

838
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:46,460
Come on, come on, come on

839
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:50,460
Come on, come on, come on

840
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,460
Come on, come on come on

841
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,460
Come on, come on

842
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,460
I'll figure feeling alone

843
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:05,460
Three facial hopes to change them

844
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:09,460
I'm not afraid to touchА how I believe

845
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:12,460
I'll feel it, I will always stress

846
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,460
Feel lies

847
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:14,460
Too many things

848
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,460
Now it's just, how I feel Yeah

849
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,460
Look you mirror how neck's your lingering

850
01:04:49,460 --> 01:05:00,460
If you're lucky it's perfect for the natural

851
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:05,460
Do you think that I'm so kind of dumb?

852
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:10,460
It's the ideal way to order the world

853
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:16,460
For those who make it in my name

854
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:20,460
If you don't like it, then leave

855
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:25,460
I'll use your right to protest on the streets

856
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:29,460
If you're right, we're talking about you

857
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,460
No, no, no, no, no, no

858
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:35,460
It's just how you love it more

859
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:40,460
It's just how you love it more

860
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:46,460
It's just how you love it

861
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:50,460
It's just how you love it

862
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:59,460
It's just how you love it more

863
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:04,460
It's just how you love

864
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:10,460
Jarvis Cocker, you can only say it in the UK.

865
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,460
Cuts are still running the world.

866
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,460
Hell yeah.

867
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,460
You know that.

868
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:21,460
It's wanna make my position clear once again that when it comes to the two leading candidates,

869
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:26,460
the only ones allowed in the debates, the only ones really allowed into the election race,

870
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:29,460
which is the nominee from the Democratic Party,

871
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:31,460
nominee from the Republican Party.

872
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:33,460
Because there are other independence

873
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:36,460
who, in many cases, are on the ballot everywhere,

874
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,460
not everywhere, but in most states, Cynthia McKinney,

875
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:44,460
Chuck Baldwin, Bob Barr, and Ralph Nader.

876
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:49,460
There may even be more, but those are the four independent time Canadian right off the top of my head.

877
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:51,460
They're not invited to the debates.

878
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:54,460
Why? Because it's a messed up system.

879
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:59,460
But at the end of the day, it is the same people running these two candidates,

880
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,460
the four runners, Barack Obama and John McCain.

881
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:05,460
And just to give you some proof,

882
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,460
it's a big new Brazinski.

883
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,460
He was the guy that was running Jimmy Carter,

884
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:15,460
and he's written books, and he's self-proclaimed Marxist.

885
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:21,460
His sons are now both advising each of the candidates.

886
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:27,460
So his son, Mark Brazinski, is a foreign policy advisor to the Obama campaign to Obama,

887
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:30,460
and I'm sure we'll be in this cabinet.

888
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:34,460
And Ian Brazinski is advisor to John McCain.

889
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:39,460
So the control is there through the lineage.

890
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:42,460
And these two guys, they are merely actors.

891
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,460
That's really what they are. They are actors.

892
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,460
And they're good ones.

893
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:49,460
Although it seems like Obama gets all the good lines, all the good jokes.

894
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:53,460
And the writers are really playing up his character, the true writers.

895
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:56,460
And McCain has been reduced to a bit player.

896
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:59,460
You know, it's like a soap opera.

897
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,460
And it's the way it feels, and it's the way I would produce it,

898
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,460
if I were running it, because it gets great ratings.

899
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:08,460
And all of this money that they raise essentially goes right into the media

900
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:13,460
to buy airtime, Obama just bought a half hour commercial.

901
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:17,460
All these ads, it's hundreds and hundreds of millions.

902
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:22,460
So it's a closed loop system, and it works very well, and they don't want to change that.

903
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:27,460
But the way I express this has resulted in some pretty aggressive feedback.

904
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:33,460
Now, this can also be from conversation I've had with John C. Dvorak on Noah Genda.

905
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:37,460
But I did want to share two emails.

906
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,460
Unfortunately, they didn't come through.

907
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,460
I'd love to have these in audio.

908
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:42,460
Even if you're pissed at me, please, leave a voice mail.

909
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:45,460
The email is kind of boring, and I did ask these people independently.

910
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:47,460
And you know, send this to me in a voice mail, man.

911
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:51,460
This is good stuff, because you know, this is a dialogue I want to have.

912
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,460
This first one coming from Kim Costello.

913
01:08:54,460 --> 01:09:00,460
You are entitled to your opinion, but have you ever tried to do real research on Obama?

914
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:04,460
So whenever someone starts with that, I'm like, wow, you have not been listening to me,

915
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:08,460
and to this show for a long time at all, because I do nothing else.

916
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:13,460
I spend a lot of my time researching, and mainly on the stuff that people make public themselves.

917
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:19,460
And yes, I'm very familiar with the Obama's policies, because it's all right there on Barakobama.com.

918
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:20,460
I can continue.

919
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:23,460
It's all right not to like the guy, which I've never said.

920
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,460
I like the guys.

921
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:26,460
He seems perfectly okay.

922
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:28,460
He's a great candidate.

923
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,460
I wish we could be programming him.

924
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:35,460
And we could be giving him the right things to say and to do and to promise.

925
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:40,460
Anyway, says it's all right not to like the guy, but your reasoning is just crazy.

926
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:44,460
You keep stating that you know what he is going to do as president and it scares you.

927
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:47,460
My question is, where did you get this mysterious knowledge of Obama?

928
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:49,460
You sound like a fox news pundit.

929
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,460
Well, yeah.

930
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:56,460
And when I talk about McCain, I sound like a CNN pundit.

931
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:59,460
And have you ever played the CNN Fox game?

932
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:02,460
It's best after debate, which of course we don't have right now.

933
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:07,460
But even if you just from time to time, put, you know, use the last channel, the flashback,

934
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:12,460
whatever the button is called on your remote control, and go flip back and forth between Fox and CNN.

935
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:15,460
And Fox will be, you know, all four McCain against Obama.

936
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:18,460
And CNN will be all four Obama against McCain.

937
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:19,460
It's a setup.

938
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,460
You know, is that obvious?

939
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:23,460
And it's just obvious.

940
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:27,460
This is, it's all part of the game.

941
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:31,460
Now, here's the thing that a lot of people responded to that I've received several emails.

942
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:36,460
And it really surprises me when I get this.

943
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:40,460
Also, Kim says, you always state that you are not a racist.

944
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:45,460
Yet you also say, you are afraid what will happen if Obama is not elected.

945
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,460
Oh, no, riots.

946
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:50,460
That is pretty fucking racist.

947
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,460
Black people can't contain their militant anger.

948
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:57,460
Now, here's what's interesting.

949
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:03,460
Whenever I say, hey, man, I really hope Obama wins because there's going to be riots if he does it.

950
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:09,460
I'm thinking about the neighbor I have in San Francisco who's working two hours a day in her spare time.

951
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:15,460
For the campaign going to Obama camp and has completely been assimilated by the process.

952
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:18,460
And it's thinking this way.

953
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:21,460
Is she's a woman?

954
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,460
She's white and she's Jewish.

955
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,460
I see her writing.

956
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,460
I see yuppies writing.

957
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:30,460
But the true racist, sir, is you.

958
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:34,460
I presume, I'm presuming Kim is a him.

959
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,460
Could be heard, doesn't matter.

960
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:37,460
You're, you're the racist.

961
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,460
You're the one that thinks riots.

962
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:40,460
Oh, black people.

963
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,460
I never said that.

964
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:45,460
Never have never even entered my head.

965
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:47,460
And I get a lot of that.

966
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:54,460
So those of you who imply or think that I imply that black people would be writing, you're the racist.

967
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:56,460
You're thinking that.

968
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:57,460
Not me.

969
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:59,460
And you're reflecting it in your emails.

970
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:00,460
Crazy.

971
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:03,460
No, no, I'm thinking yuppies.

972
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:10,460
You know, I'm thinking people who are totally, totally, totally assimilated into this process.

973
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:12,460
And they're going to be angry.

974
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:14,460
But I don't think we have to worry about it.

975
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,460
Honestly, I think the playbook is pretty clear.

976
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:19,460
So here's the second type of feedback that I've received.

977
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:22,460
She's also quite misunderstood.

978
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:24,460
Adam, I really enjoyed the podcast.

979
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:27,460
The quote of yours from the recent show.

980
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:30,460
And I think this is an accurate quote.

981
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:32,460
I hear what Obama is going to do.

982
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:36,460
Running companies and countries that are socialist, which is the direction the US has had.

983
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:38,460
Our company is the one that's going to get screwed.

984
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,460
We're going to get all the tax crap.

985
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:43,460
All that shit's going to come down on us.

986
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:49,460
We're the ones that are actually working in people who are lazy bitchers are going to be sitting around taking handouts and not wanting to do anything.

987
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:51,460
This is not what America is about.

988
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:53,460
Absolutely.

989
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:54,460
I totally agree.

990
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:57,460
And when I look at the economic plan.

991
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,460
In this case, Obama doesn't matter.

992
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,460
McCain has as the same stupid ideas.

993
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:09,460
It's just packaged a different way in the less compelling way to the majority of voters.

994
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:15,460
And so Matt goes on to say, you are an insulated coddled out of touch ignorant fuck.

995
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:21,460
Obama raising the top tax rate for percent with the scary socialist Ronald Reagan had it.

996
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:28,460
So that the other 96% of Americans can actually have a bit of a tax cut after being screwed over the past eight years.

997
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:31,460
And this isn't going to turn us into Sweden, let alone the UK.

998
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:37,460
You come off as such an elitist trick talking about the poor people sitting around taking handouts.

999
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:40,460
Most people with an average income are working their asses off,

1000
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:47,460
often without health care to try to get their businesses going or just trying to get fed to get by and feed their kids.

1001
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,460
And you're talking about how you're a real patriot.

1002
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:55,460
Take your thought policing false nationalism and shove it up your ass you fraud.

1003
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:02,460
So I'm amazed at these types of comments if you actually understand what is being proposed.

1004
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:11,460
And you're incorrect in saying that there's only talk of a tax cut.

1005
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:15,460
It is refundable tax credits.

1006
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:19,460
And it will go to people who don't pay taxes at all.

1007
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:27,460
There is very little, in fact, there's only one line in the whole Obama plan about what is going to do for small business.

1008
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:30,460
And that is making loans available.

1009
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:32,460
Well, I haven't seen that.

1010
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:33,460
I don't see any information.

1011
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:35,460
I don't see any expansion.

1012
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:39,460
And when I say we, I'm not talking about rich people.

1013
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:42,460
I'm talking about people running businesses, small businesses.

1014
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:44,460
I'm running a small business.

1015
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:52,460
And Obama and McCain voted to give our money to the rich guys.

1016
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,460
And but you're not outraged about that.

1017
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:56,460
You just sit back and go, okay.

1018
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:58,460
I'm sure that they're doing the right thing.

1019
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,460
You know, Obama voted for it.

1020
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:02,460
McCain voted for it.

1021
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:07,460
Do you know that Hillary Clinton's health care plan?

1022
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:15,460
That or indifferent was going to cost 110 billion dollars a year for universal health care.

1023
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:19,460
And it got beaten down primarily, I think, on cost.

1024
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:25,460
So we could have had, you know, in this bailout, of course, is eventually going to cost much more than 700 billion.

1025
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:28,460
That was just the cold hard beginnings of the cash.

1026
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:32,460
But take that and compound the value of that over 10 years.

1027
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,460
You know, it's going to be trillions.

1028
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:37,460
So we could have had, we could have fixed health care.

1029
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:40,460
We tried to fix the financial industry.

1030
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:42,460
None of that money went into your house or mine.

1031
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:44,460
None of that money went into my business.

1032
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:50,460
None of that money went anywhere except to the same people who created the problems.

1033
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:55,460
And it was just printed so we're paying for it.

1034
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,460
Where's the outrage?

1035
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,460
That's what you should be outraged about.

1036
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:03,460
That that is by definition wrong.

1037
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:11,460
And the creating jobs is what we need to do.

1038
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:16,460
So, you know, poor people who can't afford health care, what we could have fixed that.

1039
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:18,460
We could have fixed that in a month's time.

1040
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:20,460
Boom, the money was clearly there.

1041
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:22,460
We had the money to bail out the financial industry.

1042
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:25,460
You're buying those lies, I guess.

1043
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:27,460
So why couldn't we just fix that?

1044
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:32,460
We could have used any health care plan that was on the table.

1045
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:35,460
But we didn't.

1046
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:40,460
And people who don't have a job should not be receiving a refundable tax credit,

1047
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:44,460
they should be receiving the opportunity to work with a job.

1048
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:48,460
I mean, actually, I'd rather bail out the auto industry,

1049
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:51,460
which, you know, they're asking for such a small amount of,

1050
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:55,460
comparatively speaking, you know, 30, 30 or 50 billion, I think.

1051
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:57,460
That's a small amount of money.

1052
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:59,460
And one billion goes a long way.

1053
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:01,460
I mean, that's what's being officially reported.

1054
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:04,460
And it's been in, creates 30,000 jobs.

1055
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:07,460
So take, if we're going to, and I'll pay for it.

1056
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:08,460
I don't mind.

1057
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:09,460
You can take more of my taxes.

1058
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,460
That's fine.

1059
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,460
But, you know, I'm, what I'm seeing is a whole lot of stuff.

1060
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:20,460
I'm not seeing, I'm actually not seeing money going to create jobs.

1061
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:23,460
I'm just not seeing it.

1062
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:28,460
And I'm sorry that you think that I'm talking about me.

1063
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:31,460
Like, I'm, like, I'm really super rich.

1064
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:36,460
And by the way, part of the American dream used to be that you could make it,

1065
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,460
and that you could be proud of that.

1066
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:41,460
And other people would be happy for you and aspire to that.

1067
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:44,460
That's one of the things that was always very different about America.

1068
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,460
That's now gone.

1069
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,460
It's now a dirty.

1070
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:48,460
It's now dirty to have money.

1071
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:50,460
Apparently.

1072
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:53,460
And what I've seen from my experience,

1073
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:57,460
and I've lived in the couple countries where this exact system is in place,

1074
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:01,460
is you get a complacent culture.

1075
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:08,460
And you get all kinds of screwed up things where people are just kind of working.

1076
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,460
Yeah, I mean, yeah, okay.

1077
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:13,460
So, then we'll probably get job credits and stuff like that.

1078
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:16,460
And people will be working in places that don't really want to work.

1079
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:21,460
And just more slavery is the way I see it.

1080
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:26,460
And by the way, I work my ass off too to feed my family.

1081
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:30,460
And to help feed 60 other families.

1082
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:32,460
That's what America's about.

1083
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:34,460
And I think that is very patriotic.

1084
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:42,460
And I'm wondering how I can miscommunicate so grossly that people respond in this manner.

1085
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:48,460
And I truly believe that you're just really not reading the facts as they're stated.

1086
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:52,460
It shows becoming longer than I wanted it to be.

1087
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:57,460
But, you know, have you actually gone to Barackobama.com?

1088
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:03,460
And by the way, again, I'm not saying this to defunct anyone, debunk or talk down.

1089
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:04,460
It doesn't matter.

1090
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:06,460
I haven't even looked at McCain.

1091
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:08,460
I'm so uninterested in what he's doing.

1092
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:11,460
And I'm sure he's not going anywhere.

1093
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,460
He certainly won't be president.

1094
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:16,460
But, you know, when I see what Obama's doing on defense,

1095
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:19,460
he's doubling up, doubling up on troops,

1096
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,460
doubling up on rapid response teams.

1097
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:25,460
It's all right here in the actual documentation.

1098
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:29,460
He's going to find, disrupt, and destroy Al Qaeda.

1099
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:34,460
Yeah, so we're just going to be in more places.

1100
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:38,460
Staying in Afghanistan, sending more to Afghanistan.

1101
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:40,460
It says it right here on the website.

1102
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:44,460
This is probably my favorite.

1103
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:50,460
This is a crazy one about the avian bird flu.

1104
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:54,460
Let me just, avian, here we go.

1105
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:58,460
Barackobama and Joe Biden pledged to lead an international effort

1106
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:03,460
to diminish impact of major infectious disease epidemics.

1107
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:07,460
Senator Obama was one of the first legislators to recognize

1108
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:11,460
the dangers of a potential avian influenza pandemic

1109
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:15,460
and was successful in securing 25 million for US agencies

1110
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:19,460
to combat and contain widespread outbreaks of avian flu

1111
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:24,460
and work to provide $4 billion in funding

1112
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:28,460
for the Centers for Disease Control to combat avian flu.

1113
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,460
What do you think that money's going?

1114
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:32,460
It's going right into the big pharmaceuticals

1115
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:35,460
for a non-existent virus.

1116
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:39,460
So far, there is no version that goes from bird to human.

1117
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:43,460
Yet there's $4 billion waiting for this to happen.

1118
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:45,460
And we've gone over this so many times.

1119
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:48,460
How many people have died of the bird flu?

1120
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:51,460
In 15 years, doubtful 150.

1121
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:54,460
And we don't even know if they really died from, you know,

1122
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:57,460
we know that they didn't die from a bird to human version.

1123
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,460
They died from a bird version.

1124
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:01,460
And there's a lot of other issues out there

1125
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:05,460
that could deserve $4 billion in funding.

1126
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:08,460
Barackobama will continue to promote international efforts

1127
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:10,460
to develop new diagnostics vaccines

1128
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:12,460
and medicines that will be available in affordable

1129
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:14,460
in all parts of the world.

1130
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:18,460
Maybe I just read this differently.

1131
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:21,460
But have a look at our information networks.

1132
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,460
That's a different section.

1133
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:25,460
Protect our information networks.

1134
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:29,460
Everywhere I look, I see a new database being built.

1135
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:33,460
I see secondary internet being built.

1136
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:36,460
Barackobama will work with industry and academia

1137
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:40,460
to develop and deploy a new generation of secure hardware

1138
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:44,460
and software for our nation's critical cyber infrastructure.

1139
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:50,460
I don't know.

1140
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:53,460
Everywhere I look under any section.

1141
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:54,460
And it's quite detailed.

1142
01:21:54,460 --> 01:22:01,460
These plans are very, very detailed.

1143
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:05,460
Doubling the Homeland Security, doubling border protection.

1144
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:14,460
Locking everything down, creating civilian forces,

1145
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:20,460
forth there's some event.

1146
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:26,460
Here on taxes, this is the one I was actually looking for.

1147
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:29,460
For corporate tax.

1148
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:33,460
Kind of interesting, by the way, that on the website,

1149
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:37,460
the tax cut comes above $250,000,

1150
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:39,460
but in the half hour information that he did,

1151
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:41,460
that price has not been lowered,

1152
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:44,460
or that level has been lowered to $200,000.

1153
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,460
I don't know which one is right now.

1154
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:48,460
If that was the updated amount,

1155
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:52,460
they might want to update the website.

1156
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:56,460
So giving you a credit, seven, up to $7,000

1157
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:58,460
for the right car.

1158
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:00,460
Well, damn.

1159
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:02,460
I'll take that.

1160
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:04,460
I don't think it's right.

1161
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:07,460
But, you know, we're bailing out the car companies,

1162
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:10,460
and we're giving money to people to buy cars.

1163
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:15,460
Okay, where's the thing about small businesses?

1164
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:19,460
Eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses,

1165
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:23,460
cut corporate taxes for firms that invest and create jobs in the United States,

1166
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:26,460
and provide tax credits to reduce the cost of health care,

1167
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:29,460
and to reward investments and innovation.

1168
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:30,460
Like all of that.

1169
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:31,460
But there's no expansion.

1170
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:34,460
It's just everything else is very detailed down to the dollar.

1171
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:38,460
When it comes to what you, what's going to be given to small businesses,

1172
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:39,460
it doesn't say it anywhere.

1173
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:42,460
There's no further information,

1174
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:45,460
which makes me suspicious.

1175
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:46,460
And that's what I mean.

1176
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:48,460
Why I say that, you know,

1177
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:50,460
it's turning into,

1178
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,460
it's turning into a,

1179
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,460
do a system of the government takes care of everything.

1180
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:57,460
And it's just not the way it's always worked.

1181
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:00,460
And it's not the way the Constitution stipulates it,

1182
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:01,460
and that's so air-go,

1183
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:03,460
not what America should be.

1184
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:05,460
If America wants to be different,

1185
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,460
then we should change the Constitution.

1186
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:10,460
But, but not this way.

1187
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:12,460
So anyway,

1188
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:15,460
I'm going to try to do better on the communication of these issues,

1189
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:17,460
and I'm not,

1190
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:20,460
I'm not on any way think that I can change anyone's mind,

1191
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:21,460
on what they want to vote,

1192
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:23,460
and moreover it doesn't matter.

1193
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:26,460
This is being run by people behind the scenes.

1194
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:29,460
And if you're so ignorant to think,

1195
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:31,460
that when you have two parties that these,

1196
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:34,460
and fundraising that is undefined, rampant,

1197
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:36,460
and you can do whatever you want to do,

1198
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:39,460
and take from wherever you want to take from pretty much,

1199
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:40,460
you know,

1200
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:42,460
if you think there isn't a price to be paid,

1201
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,460
and if that isn't to buy influence,

1202
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:45,460
will you're crazy?

1203
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:47,460
You're absolutely crazy.

1204
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:49,460
Of course that's being done.

1205
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:52,460
And what I recognize or come to recognize,

1206
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:54,460
is this has been going on for a long time,

1207
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,460
and maybe now I'm just a little bit more awake,

1208
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:59,460
but it seems like it's so much more blatant.

1209
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:01,460
And I've done it.

1210
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:05,460
I've tried to build business in other countries,

1211
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:10,460
where it is the direction that this ticket will take us,

1212
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:13,460
and I've failed at it.

1213
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:15,460
It's impossible to do.

1214
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:19,460
You get all kinds of rules and regulations,

1215
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:22,460
and we're going to get carbon credits and taxes,

1216
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:26,460
and it's just slavery, complete slavery.

1217
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,460
Speaking of enslavement,

1218
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:30,460
and I don't have much more to do.

1219
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:34,460
I do want to get to that review of the G1 Google phone.

1220
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,460
This was just kind of scary.

1221
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:39,460
It was a piece in the New York Times

1222
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:41,460
that I just wanted to share with you.

1223
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:44,460
It's called the California Prison Disaster.

1224
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:46,460
Now, if you don't know in the United States,

1225
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:47,460
and by the way,

1226
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:50,460
we're going to get more of this under either McCain or Obama.

1227
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:53,460
The prison systems are being privatized and commercialized.

1228
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:56,460
So there is, although they say there isn't,

1229
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:59,460
there is of course an incentive to have more inmates,

1230
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:00,460
or at least a quota,

1231
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:02,460
because that's how you make money.

1232
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:03,460
It's a profitable system.

1233
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:07,460
Each inmate has a profit associated with it.

1234
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:09,460
But then when you really look at the statistics,

1235
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:10,460
it's frightening.

1236
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:13,460
The mass imprisonment philosophy that has packed prisons

1237
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:15,460
and sent correction costs through the roof

1238
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:16,460
around the country is hit,

1239
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:18,460
especially card in California,

1240
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,460
which has the largest prison population,

1241
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:22,460
the highest recidivism.

1242
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:24,460
I knew I was going to stumble on that.

1243
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:26,460
recidivism rate,

1244
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:29,460
and a prison budget raging out of control.

1245
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:30,460
Now.

1246
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:34,460
Here we go.

1247
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:39,460
You know,

1248
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:42,460
this isn't crap.

1249
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:44,460
This isn't the one I wanted to read to you.

1250
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:46,460
Oh, shit. This is the wrong article.

1251
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:48,460
Oh, man.

1252
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:51,460
Well, the whole, it is an article about marijuana, essentially,

1253
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:55,460
and how million people are in jail on marijuana,

1254
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,460
marijuana usage charges,

1255
01:26:57,460 --> 01:27:00,460
not on, not on distribution,

1256
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:01,460
but on,

1257
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:05,460
on being users of this plant.

1258
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:07,460
And the crazy thing is,

1259
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:08,460
and how, man,

1260
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:09,460
now I'm pissed off.

1261
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:11,460
I have the wrong article.

1262
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:14,460
Okay, so roughly the statistics that I found,

1263
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:15,460
which just freaked me out,

1264
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:18,460
was that it's roughly equal men and women

1265
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:20,460
who smoke marijuana,

1266
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:23,460
although more white people smoke marijuana,

1267
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:26,460
86% of people in jail,

1268
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:30,460
for smoking marijuana are black.

1269
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:32,460
And it's tripping me out

1270
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:36,460
that that's what's going on in the United States.

1271
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:40,460
And it may be going on just about everywhere else,

1272
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:43,460
and it's messed up.

1273
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:46,460
All right.

1274
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:48,460
Time for a commercial break,

1275
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:49,460
and a fun manner?

1276
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,460
Hey Adam, Chris here from Seattle.

1277
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:53,460
I wanted to tell you what happened to me the other day.

1278
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:56,460
Since I never got to quit my day job,

1279
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:58,460
a couple of years ago,

1280
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:00,460
I ended up getting a job in IT.

1281
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:04,460
One of my clients is a advertising

1282
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:05,460
and communications firm,

1283
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:08,460
and specializes in non-profit organizations

1284
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:09,460
that are making a difference.

1285
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:10,460
Why am I calling and telling you about it?

1286
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:12,460
Because I had to say this.

1287
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:15,460
The client said they wanted to register

1288
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,460
a whole bunch of domain names.

1289
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:18,460
And I said, well wait,

1290
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:20,460
we're going to register them

1291
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:21,460
with, of course, they said go daddy.

1292
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:22,460
I said, well before you do that,

1293
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:24,460
let me get you a code.

1294
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:27,460
It will actually help you save some money on doing so.

1295
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:29,460
And they said, oh, that's a great idea.

1296
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:32,460
No way he says, where did you get this code from?

1297
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:35,460
I said, well, have you ever heard of a guy named Adam Curry?

1298
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:39,460
She says, do I know what fucking Adam Curry is?

1299
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:41,460
That's her law for me.

1300
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:43,460
She goes, this company,

1301
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:46,460
that can she go with a company for 17 years now.

1302
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:48,460
This company back in one of its iterations,

1303
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:51,460
used to be owned, I think, new ideas.

1304
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:52,460
Yeah.

1305
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,460
And we sat and talked and she knew about you

1306
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:56,460
and she didn't know anything about what you were doing

1307
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:57,460
but turned around on the website.

1308
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:59,460
And back, what I said was,

1309
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:01,460
I said do I'll be honest,

1310
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:03,460
if you guys, if I was doing what you were doing,

1311
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:05,460
I'd be looking very strongly into media

1312
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:06,460
and what they can do for your clients.

1313
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:08,460
That's how it's podcasting goes

1314
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,460
into independent media distribution all of those.

1315
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:11,460
That's the only way.

1316
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:12,460
I had to share that with you.

1317
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:13,460
I'm sure by now you know exactly

1318
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:16,460
which company it's an advertising firm in Seattle.

1319
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:17,460
17 years.

1320
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:18,460
You got to know something.

1321
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:20,460
Anyway, I had to share that with you

1322
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:23,460
and let you know that we're using the DSC codes

1323
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:25,460
for GoDaddy in unique ways.

1324
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,460
How do we do Adam?

1325
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:27,460
No, man.

1326
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:28,460
Chris, I really appreciate it.

1327
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:29,460
First of all, for the, you know,

1328
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:31,460
the blast from the past there.

1329
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:32,460
Yep.

1330
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:35,460
That's the company that's a run and I started,

1331
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:40,460
I was at 94 and took public wound up selling it 99

1332
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:43,460
when everyone said we were nuts.

1333
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:45,460
And you know,

1334
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:47,460
I know the company still exists.

1335
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:49,460
Today is still profitable.

1336
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:51,460
I think they're still listed as I think

1337
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:53,460
it's the Hackett group now.

1338
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:55,460
They did change their name.

1339
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:58,460
And it wouldn't surprise me if the Seattle office

1340
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:00,460
is still the member of the company.

1341
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:01,460
And it's very cool.

1342
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:03,460
And I appreciate you turn them on to that.

1343
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:06,460
Of course, that's the whole system with this,

1344
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:09,460
these sponsors of many shows,

1345
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:10,460
including the daily source code.

1346
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:13,460
You can find all different links in the show notes,

1347
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:16,460
daily source code.com or crossposts at a curie.com.

1348
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:19,460
You'll see the same type of great deals for a budget

1349
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:21,460
rent to car for e-music.

1350
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:26,460
We can get, was it 35 free songs, 25, 25 free songs.

1351
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,460
What else do we have?

1352
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:29,460
Brooks Stone.

1353
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,460
And what we do is we actually go out.

1354
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:34,460
We negotiate these great deals with these companies.

1355
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:36,460
And then we only,

1356
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:39,460
the producers only get paid on a success basis.

1357
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:42,460
So if you buy something and you use one of

1358
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:44,460
the mevio producers codes,

1359
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:47,460
then that's when they actually get paid.

1360
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,460
And so it incentivizes them to,

1361
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:50,460
you know, to talk about it,

1362
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:52,460
to motivate their audience.

1363
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:53,460
If they're going to buy it anyway,

1364
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:55,460
if you're going to rent a car as an example anyway,

1365
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:56,460
or get domain names,

1366
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,460
you might as well get the best deal anywhere

1367
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:00,460
and support your favorite show.

1368
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:03,460
It's that simple.

1369
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:04,460
All right.

1370
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:06,460
Enough with all that.

1371
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:11,460
So we switched our phone providers from AT&T to T-Mobile in San Francisco

1372
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:13,460
at the head office.

1373
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:15,460
And that gave us the opportunity as part of the deal

1374
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:17,460
to get new phones.

1375
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:20,460
And so first, and I hadn't even done a review of it.

1376
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:22,460
It was such a horrible experience.

1377
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:25,460
I could, well, obviously I wanted the Google

1378
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:27,460
phone because I wanted to try it out and share the experience

1379
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:28,460
with you guys with the chuckle heads.

1380
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:29,460
They didn't have it yet.

1381
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:32,460
So first I got the Windows Mobile

1382
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:35,460
Christ, now I forget which model it was.

1383
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:37,460
I mean, I had it for literally one day.

1384
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:42,460
And I gave it back crying to Chris and David and IT.

1385
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:45,460
It was like Windows only a small.

1386
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:47,460
And you need to stylists to operate it.

1387
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:49,460
And it was all clunky feeling.

1388
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:51,460
And it was just horrible.

1389
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:54,460
You know, stuff that would take me one finger move

1390
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:57,460
or maybe two actions on the Nokia,

1391
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:00,460
on the E71 would take five steps on this.

1392
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:06,460
It was just completely uselessness, completely worthless,

1393
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:10,460
really unbelievably bad experience.

1394
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:13,460
And then finally they switched it out.

1395
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:16,460
And I was given the new G1 Google phone.

1396
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:19,460
And very, very interesting device.

1397
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:23,460
Now the hardware itself is made by I believe HTC.

1398
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:27,460
And of course it contains the Android,

1399
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:30,460
I guess we'll call it operating system.

1400
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:34,460
I'm not sure if it's a layer on top of Linux or if it is a full OS,

1401
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:35,460
it doesn't matter.

1402
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:37,460
You know, and apparently it's all open.

1403
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:40,460
So you can write applications and change stuff.

1404
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:43,460
And it's the whole idea of this is an open source phone

1405
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:47,460
that you can then customize and make better or run as you want to run it,

1406
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:50,460
which is what the whole Linux vibe is about.

1407
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:55,460
And that is very much Google strategy with all of their tools

1408
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:58,460
and all of their services.

1409
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:01,460
So let me start first by saying I'm not a big fan of a phone

1410
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:05,460
that doesn't have at least some exposed keys on the front.

1411
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:08,460
I really love the E71 for that very reason

1412
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:11,460
that the keys are right there and no flipping anything open.

1413
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:14,460
You don't have to turn it sideways, slide something out.

1414
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:15,460
It's just there.

1415
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:16,460
And they're manageable.

1416
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:19,460
You can actually, they're usable.

1417
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:22,460
So to access the keypad on the G1, you have to flip it open,

1418
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:25,460
which, interestingly enough, is done in a kind of a sexy way.

1419
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:29,460
It's almost like, where's the, where they call them,

1420
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:34,460
the hip tops or all the kids are using them.

1421
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:37,460
I can't remember the name of the device.

1422
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:42,460
But you, you kind of flip it open and then you turn it 90 degrees

1423
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:43,460
and then you had this.

1424
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:46,460
So the screen also flips 90 degrees beautiful screen.

1425
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:51,460
Touch, but you can also, there's a little track ball

1426
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:53,460
that you have as a mouse.

1427
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:56,460
The browser is quite nice.

1428
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:59,460
Of course, it, it never does, you know, all the stuff

1429
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:02,460
the traditional browser does like flash videos as an example

1430
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:04,460
or any type of flash functionality.

1431
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:05,460
Keyboard, not bad.

1432
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:07,460
But it's really, it's almost unimportant

1433
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:10,460
as to what is happening and what this device is all about.

1434
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:11,460
Just a couple more hard work bits.

1435
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:13,460
Three megapixel camera is nice.

1436
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:16,460
It's got built in Bluetooth, although I,

1437
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:18,460
but don't think it's for transferring a files

1438
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:22,460
only for a headset or other external audio device

1439
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:24,460
has Wi-Fi built into it.

1440
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:27,460
It switches seamlessly back and forth between

1441
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:30,460
3G network and Wi-Fi.

1442
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:33,460
If it finds an access point that is defined.

1443
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:38,460
So very much, a lot of the, the iPhone experience

1444
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:43,460
in a way, also, the screen size and the feel of the unit,

1445
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:45,460
although it feels really robust, it feels like

1446
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:48,460
a good drop this and, you know, it wouldn't hurt it.

1447
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:50,460
It actually feels like a good drive over it

1448
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:51,460
and it wouldn't hurt it.

1449
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:53,460
The screen is not multi-touch.

1450
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:54,460
So that's kind of a bummer, you know,

1451
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:56,460
I'm immediately going, oh, I want to, you know,

1452
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:57,460
want to zoom in on that.

1453
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:59,460
It had, it's zoom functions work very differently

1454
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:00,460
from the iPhone.

1455
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:04,460
It's just, it's a whole different concept, really.

1456
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:07,460
But the luminance of the screen and what you can read

1457
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:08,460
is beautiful.

1458
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:12,460
But what really got me is you start this thing up for the first time

1459
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:15,460
and it says, okay, do you have a Google account

1460
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:18,460
or do you want to use your existing one?

1461
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:20,460
And you use your existing, yeah,

1462
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:22,460
so you, you enter your Google account information

1463
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:24,460
or presumably you set up a new account

1464
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:27,460
and it immediately starts to come alive.

1465
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:30,460
And I really like this because I use a lot of Google products.

1466
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:32,460
I use, well, I actually use Google apps,

1467
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:34,460
but now for predominantly the mail,

1468
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:36,460
I use Google Calendar.

1469
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:40,460
I do not use Google address book,

1470
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:42,460
which is, of course, one of the flaws.

1471
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:45,460
You know, how do I get my stuff into the address book?

1472
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:47,460
I would have to go suck it out somehow and suck it

1473
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:49,460
into my Google account.

1474
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:51,460
But really the phone comes alive.

1475
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:54,460
The services become activated with all your info.

1476
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:59,460
And it integrates some of your multimedia.

1477
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:03,460
You know, that is what really, really struck me is,

1478
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:06,460
these guys now have an operating system

1479
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:10,460
that goes along with their software services.

1480
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:14,460
And that integration is on par with what Apple

1481
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:15,460
has always been thinking about,

1482
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:17,460
but Apple really started from the reverse

1483
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:20,460
and said, okay, here's these devices.

1484
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:22,460
Now we're going to kind of all sync it together

1485
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:24,460
with mobile me and I think it's pretty well

1486
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:26,460
know that mobile me didn't turn out quite the way

1487
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:28,460
they expected it to.

1488
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:31,460
And it hasn't really lived up to the performance.

1489
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:35,460
I think that a lot of other cloud-like services have.

1490
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:37,460
But Google so many people use it already

1491
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:39,460
that it makes sense.

1492
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:41,460
Now granted this still, I mean,

1493
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:43,460
this is still very much an engineering release

1494
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:45,460
is what I'd call this.

1495
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:48,460
You know, everything works and everything fits together

1496
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:51,460
but they're missing a lot of the little bits of finesse

1497
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:56,460
like how, for instance, do I send a web page to someone?

1498
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:59,460
Can I, it seems hard to copy

1499
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:02,460
the link of a page that I'm on and put that somewhere?

1500
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:05,460
They haven't quite integrated the Google Notebook.

1501
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:07,460
Docs is not fully integrated,

1502
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:09,460
but they're getting there.

1503
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:12,460
And I think that this is much less about

1504
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:15,460
it being a phone where it kind of fails

1505
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:17,460
on battery life alone like three hours

1506
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:18,460
and the thing is empty.

1507
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:20,460
So that's no good.

1508
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:25,460
It's much more about this is what Google's plan

1509
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:28,460
and strategy is for all devices.

1510
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:32,460
So this would, I can see this work perfectly well on net books.

1511
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:36,460
I can see it working perfectly well on PDAs.

1512
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:39,460
And the cell phone is just, it's just kind of a way to,

1513
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:41,460
you know, to get their foot in the door.

1514
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:44,460
I would not advise anyone who's used

1515
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:47,460
to some pretty normal common functionality

1516
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:49,460
of a regular mobile phone.

1517
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:51,460
Like what I get on my Nokia,

1518
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:53,460
I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this

1519
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:56,460
if that's what you're looking for because you're just not going to get it.

1520
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:59,460
Besides excellent email,

1521
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:02,460
if you're using Gmail and there is an email client

1522
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:04,460
to add other email accounts as well.

1523
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:05,460
But if you're using Gmail,

1524
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:09,460
I mean, right down to the key shortcut commands,

1525
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:11,460
it's fabulous.

1526
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:13,460
Just phenomenal.

1527
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:16,460
Being able to customize your desktop,

1528
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:18,460
let's see.

1529
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:20,460
Of course, adding applications,

1530
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:22,460
there's a marketplace where pretty much,

1531
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:24,460
you know, anyone can build something

1532
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:26,460
and get onto your store.

1533
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:28,460
The scrolling is nice.

1534
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:30,460
I'm doing it right now.

1535
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:34,460
You know, clicking on little stars to star and email.

1536
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:36,460
It all that makes sense.

1537
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:38,460
And, you know, it's, it works.

1538
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,460
The whole, it truly is the Google phone.

1539
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:41,460
I mean, it's really,

1540
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:43,460
it's Googleized,

1541
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:45,460
and then Googleized experience

1542
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:46,460
writing your hand.

1543
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:48,460
Maps with the GPS, you know,

1544
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:49,460
phenomenal.

1545
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:51,460
I haven't tried the instructions

1546
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:52,460
in the turn by turns,

1547
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:53,460
but I'm sure that's fine.

1548
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:56,460
I mean, I'm actually using Google Maps

1549
01:38:56,460 --> 01:38:58,460
on my Nokia GPS now,

1550
01:38:58,460 --> 01:38:59,460
even for directions,

1551
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:01,460
because it's much easier to find stuff.

1552
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:02,460
You can just say, oh, you know,

1553
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:06,460
like nearest, you know, nearest airport

1554
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:08,460
or maybe a particular store

1555
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:09,460
in a particular neighborhood

1556
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:11,460
and Google Maps finds that

1557
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:14,460
much better than any other software.

1558
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:15,460
But, you know, of course,

1559
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:16,460
it's lacking.

1560
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:18,460
There's, I haven't seen a VoIP client for it yet.

1561
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:19,460
I mean, there's all kinds of stuff

1562
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:21,460
that still has to come online.

1563
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:22,460
But it really, truly,

1564
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:25,460
is about the integration of the Google services,

1565
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:27,460
which so many people use already,

1566
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:28,460
far and wide,

1567
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:30,460
and an operating system,

1568
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:32,460
which I believe will export to many devices.

1569
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:33,460
And they'll get it right.

1570
01:39:33,460 --> 01:39:35,460
They will get it right.

1571
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:37,460
And I can easily see a whole new generation

1572
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:41,460
of computer users using this,

1573
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:45,460
this combination of operating system and service.

1574
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:46,460
And if anyone can do that,

1575
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:48,460
it is clearly Google.

1576
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:50,460
And their mission is so clear.

1577
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:51,460
You know, just use the services.

1578
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:53,460
They'll figure out where to put the ads

1579
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:54,460
and where to market,

1580
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:55,460
and where to make money from you.

1581
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:58,460
I mean, I'm now using Google checkout.

1582
01:39:58,460 --> 01:39:59,460
It uses, you know,

1583
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:03,460
data from my, from my Google account.

1584
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:04,460
You know,

1585
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:06,460
and you don't have to enter all this information.

1586
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:08,460
And yeah, you know,

1587
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:10,460
it means I trust Google a lot.

1588
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:11,460
And I guess doesn't matter

1589
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:12,460
because, you know,

1590
01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:13,460
once your data is online,

1591
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:14,460
it's online.

1592
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:16,460
And if anyone wants to get to it,

1593
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:17,460
they'll just tap in it.

1594
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:19,460
And there's not much you can do.

1595
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:21,460
But as it goes,

1596
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:23,460
these guys are doing a pretty damn good job.

1597
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:24,460
And I think their,

1598
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:28,460
their record is a little bit better than the government owning my data.

1599
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:30,460
And,

1600
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:33,460
yeah,

1601
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:34,460
I mean,

1602
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:36,460
I'm trying to think how to wrap this up.

1603
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:37,460
I really would say,

1604
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:40,460
as a geek gadget to,

1605
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:43,460
really hold in your hands the future,

1606
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:46,460
what Google is going to bring you.

1607
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:47,460
Excellent choice.

1608
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:49,460
And it's probably cheap enough to go out and buy that.

1609
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:51,460
I don't know if it's actually similar and locked or not.

1610
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:53,460
It may be tied into a team mobile.

1611
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:54,460
I have to,

1612
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,460
I do have another,

1613
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:56,460
a SIM card.

1614
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:58,460
I'll see if that actually makes a difference or not.

1615
01:40:58,460 --> 01:41:00,460
If you can use it.

1616
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:02,460
But as a phone,

1617
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:04,460
you'll get very frustrated because it's just not there.

1618
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:06,460
Battery life alone forget about it.

1619
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:07,460
Now,

1620
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:11,460
I do appreciate that it uses standard USB connectors.

1621
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:12,460
So,

1622
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:13,460
on the one hand,

1623
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:14,460
I appreciate it.

1624
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:16,460
So if you want to charge it,

1625
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:19,460
you use a standard USB connector that's adapter that comes with it.

1626
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:21,460
You can also just plug that into your computer.

1627
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:23,460
So you don't need to slip another adapter along with you.

1628
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:24,460
Love that.

1629
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:25,460
Unfortunately,

1630
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:27,460
the same USB connector is used for the headphones,

1631
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:30,460
which is a Collane Capital L.

1632
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:31,460
You know,

1633
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:33,460
how about a standard jack-out?

1634
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:34,460
That would be nice.

1635
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:36,460
For those of you,

1636
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:37,460
like most of you probably,

1637
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:39,460
you might have multiple Gmail accounts.

1638
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:40,460
Forget about it.

1639
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:41,460
You can only have one.

1640
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:44,460
And that's a bummer for me because I have my email on Google apps.

1641
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:47,460
And I'm using a different account from my calendar,

1642
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:49,460
which multiple people have access to.

1643
01:41:49,460 --> 01:41:50,460
And so I can't just say,

1644
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:51,460
oh, well, why don't you use this,

1645
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:53,460
this calendar account from,

1646
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:56,460
or use this data from my calendar from this account,

1647
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:58,460
and use email from a different account.

1648
01:41:58,460 --> 01:41:59,460
So that's,

1649
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:00,460
that's a massive bummer.

1650
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:01,460
Again,

1651
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:04,460
I wouldn't even know how to get my contacts in.

1652
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:06,460
My contacts sink beautifully

1653
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:09,460
between my address book on the Mac and my,

1654
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:10,460
and my Nokia,

1655
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:11,460
that's all fine.

1656
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:16,460
And this is basically my email contact.

1657
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:17,460
So, you know,

1658
01:42:17,460 --> 01:42:18,460
how do I merge that?

1659
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:19,460
I mean,

1660
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:21,460
it doesn't seem to be any path to get there.

1661
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:23,460
That's a, that's a pain.

1662
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:25,460
And of course,

1663
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:27,460
I'm not a big fan of,

1664
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:30,460
of on on screen key watch.

1665
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:31,460
Yeah,

1666
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:32,460
I don't know.

1667
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:33,460
Maybe this ain't too bad.

1668
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:34,460
I'm looking at the dialing pad right now.

1669
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:36,460
And this screen works well enough.

1670
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:38,460
Works a hell of a lot better than the on screen

1671
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:39,460
on the Windows mobile.

1672
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:40,460
I'll tell you that.

1673
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:42,460
Man, that was really bad.

1674
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:43,460
Let me see,

1675
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:45,460
just erase those numbers there.

1676
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:47,460
So,

1677
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:48,460
yeah,

1678
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:49,460
you know,

1679
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:51,460
I'm working with a couple different apps

1680
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:52,460
that I've loaded,

1681
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:55,460
which is pretty much the most interesting thing.

1682
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:57,460
And these are not necessarily web services,

1683
01:42:57,460 --> 01:42:58,460
or the Twitter,

1684
01:42:58,460 --> 01:42:59,460
Twitter,

1685
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:00,460
which is a Twitter client.

1686
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:03,460
That's basically an app that does a web service.

1687
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:05,460
But there's an interesting GPS tracking device,

1688
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:06,460
which, of course,

1689
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:08,460
integrates beautifully with Google Maps,

1690
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:09,460
but you know,

1691
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:11,460
I'm always looking to track my flights.

1692
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:16,460
And I'd like to look at that on Google Maps or Google Earth.

1693
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:17,460
And so, you know,

1694
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:20,460
people have already gotten into that and done that kind of stuff.

1695
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:21,460
And, you know,

1696
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:23,460
it looks like it's going to be a very interesting,

1697
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:25,460
a very, very interesting platform.

1698
01:43:25,460 --> 01:43:27,460
We'll see what develops.

1699
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:29,460
But let's wait for G2.

1700
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:31,460
I guess that would be the final message.

1701
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:32,460
Until there's G2,

1702
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:35,460
you definitely have no business using the G1,

1703
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:37,460
because it'll just frustrate you.

1704
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:39,460
It's 75 bucks to play around with.

1705
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:41,460
I just want to be okay.

1706
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:42,460
Be okay.

1707
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:45,460
I just want to be okay.

1708
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:48,460
I just want to be okay.

1709
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:49,460
Be okay.

1710
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:52,460
I just want to be okay.

1711
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:55,460
I just want to feel the day.

1712
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:56,460
Feel the day.

1713
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:57,460
Feel the day.

1714
01:43:57,460 --> 01:43:59,460
I just want to feel something.

1715
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:03,460
I just want to feel the day.

1716
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:04,460
Feel the day.

1717
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:07,460
I just want to feel something.

1718
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:08,460
Feel the day.

1719
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:09,460
Feel the day.

1720
01:44:09,460 --> 01:44:10,460
Feel the day.

1721
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:11,460
Feel the day.

1722
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:12,460
Feel the day.

1723
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:13,460
Feel the day.

1724
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:14,460
Feel the day.

1725
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:15,460
Feel the day.

1726
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:16,460
Feel the day.

1727
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:17,460
Feel the day.

1728
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:18,460
Feel the day.

1729
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:19,460
Feel the day.

1730
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:20,460
Feel the day.

1731
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:21,460
Feel the day.

1732
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:22,460
Feel the day.

1733
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:23,460
Feel the day.

1734
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:24,460
Feel the day.

1735
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:25,460
Feel the day.

1736
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:26,460
Feel the day.

1737
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:27,460
Feel the day.

1738
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:28,460
Feel the day.

1739
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:29,460
Feel the day.

1740
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:30,460
Feel the day.

1741
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:31,460
Feel the day.

1742
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:32,460
Feel the day.

1743
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:33,460
Feel the day.

1744
01:44:33,460 --> 01:44:34,460
Feel the day.

1745
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:35,460
Feel the day.

1746
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:36,460
Feel the day.

1747
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:37,460
Feel the day.

1748
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:38,460
Feel the day.

1749
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:39,460
Feel the day.

1750
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:40,460
Feel the day.

1751
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:41,460
Feel the day.

1752
01:44:41,460 --> 01:44:42,460
Feel the day.

1753
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:43,460
Feel the day.

1754
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:44,460
Feel the day.

1755
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:45,460

Feel the day.

1767
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:58,460
Feel the day.

1768
01:44:58,460 --> 01:44:59,460
Feel the day.

1769
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:00,460
Feel the day.

1770
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:01,460
Feel the day.

1771
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:02,460
Feel the day.

1772
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:03,460
Feel the day.

1773
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:04,460
Feel the day.

1774
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:05,460
Feel the day.

1775

Feel the day.

1776
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:06,360
Feel the day.

1777
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:36,360
I just wanna be okay, be okay, be okay, I just wanna be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, I just wanna be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, I just wanna be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be

1779
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:09,160
Our new album called BOK, which contains live recordings,

1780
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:12,480
B-Sides covers, and it's now available on iTunes as well.

1781
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,680
And a portion of the proceeds from the sale on iTunes

1782
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,720
will go to support stand-up to cancer

1783
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:20,120
and intimate online community for those

1784
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:23,280
who are touched by cancer, stand-up to number two,

1785
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:25,720
stand-up to cancer.org.

1786
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:31,280
Thank you Neil Beer's chuckle head, massive chuckle head,

1787
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:32,760
actually, for sending that in.

1788
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:34,280
All right, I don't know how it happened,

1789
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:36,320
but I've gone, this seems like the longer show

1790
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:37,400
we've ever done all of a sudden.

1791
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,920
It's the new call me, which doesn't get me

1792
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:41,200
through the top expast enough.

1793
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,480
Anyway, tomorrow I'll be back with a football Friday

1794
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:44,760
edition, get your songs in,

1795
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:47,640
load them up onto the drop.io slash daily source code

1796
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:50,520
because I do need some help in putting

1797
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:51,560
the kick-ass show.

1798
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:54,320
And we'll just go rocking and merrily into the weekend.

1799
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:57,640
I hope you'll join me for that until then,

1800
01:46:57,640 --> 01:47:00,120
be respectful, mindful, and very happy

1801
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:02,680
and careful what you do with your freedom

1802
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:04,680
and live your life with passion.

1803
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:08,680
Another fine, medial presentation, stick it in your ear.
