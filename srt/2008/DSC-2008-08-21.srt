But then come meet

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280
Why don't you sleep

30
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,280
Ask me to forgive

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Fuckin' and fuckin'

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
To live with you, baby

33
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,280
But you must live with you

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,280
All this one little thing

35
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,280
Don't want to stay near it

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,280
Baby, baby

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,280
Don't want to live

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,280
To live with you, baby

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Yeah

40
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
Baby, baby

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
Baby

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,280
Baby

43
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Baby

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Baby

45
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Baby

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280

Baby

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Baby

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,280
You stretch to the living room

51
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Mad hair of that too

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
I was a girl of a man

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
I met you

54
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
I met you, sorry

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,280
Oh, but I'm not a star yet

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,280
You'll be when I show my hand

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,280
Baby, you've come to tell me

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
Don't want to stay near it

59
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Baby, baby

60
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
If you live with you, baby

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,280
With you must live

62
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,280
All this one little thing

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,280
Don't want to stay near it

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,280
Baby, baby

65
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,280
Don't want to live with you

66
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Baby

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Baby

68
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
Baby

69
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Baby

70
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,280
Baby

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
Baby

72
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Baby

73
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
Baby

74
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,280
Baby

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
Baby

76
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
Baby

77
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,280
Baby

78
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:31,280
It's two little three, which was who was all this one little chain.

79
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Yes, you little three, which was who was all this one little chain.

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,280
Yes, you little three, which was who was all this one little chain.

81
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:47,280
Yes, you little three, which was who was all this one little chain.

82
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,280
It's two little four, two little three, from the pod save music network,

83
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,280
to be found at music.neveo.com.

84
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,280
As well as pod save music network.com, of course.

85
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
Nice.

86
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Come on boys, they come.

87
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
Oh, fade out. Oh, man, what a bummer.

88
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,280
I don't like fade out. That's so, eh.

89
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,280
80's. Hey, how you doing? Everybody's dating source code episode number 784.

90
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Adam Curry here in the curry manner.

91
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,280
Hey, we only spoke to each other a day or so ago, and I'm even going to try and do a show tomorrow.

92
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,280
Friday might even have a three show week. Imagine that.

93
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
Lots to talk about. That's the main reason.

94
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,280
You guys are just hammering me with information these days.

95
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,280
There's so much coming in, so much to process.

96
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,280
And I'm starting to kind of figure out how citizen journalism should work because, you know,

97
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,280
it's not, it's not the journalism part per se. I mean, let's face it.

98
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,280
Something isn't really truth until it's been in the newspaper, right?

99
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,280
I mean, that's the for the 99.9% of the rest of us out there who get our information from mainstream media.

100
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,280
It's not proof until it's been in the newspaper.

101
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,280
You know what? A lot of the stuff that we're seeing, a lot of the questions that are asked about

102
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,280
how our world is run, about our government, about us as people or slaves is written about.

103
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,280
And it's written about by really good journalists. And I think our job, this is what I'm seeing,

104
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
our job is to aggregate that.

105
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Adapinian as you wish, but aggregated, aggregate their own words, aggregate their own media.

106
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,280
The truth is really out there. Or as I'd like to say, there aren't no secrets only information you don't yet have.

107
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,280
And the minute you start to aggregate something, you've got, you know, five, ten,

108
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,280
fifteen or fifty sources, that becomes pretty compelling evidence to point to someone and say,

109
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,280
look, you know, here's the New York Times writing about it.

110
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,280
Here's the Washington Post writing about it. Here's the Wall Street Journal writing about it.

111
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,280
Here's a, here's a Fox news affiliate writing about it.

112
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,280
That's very powerful stuff because it truly is, it's really the editors. A lot of stuff sneaks by.

113
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,280
And they learn a lot of stuff we'll buy, but the editors aren't just such tremendous pressure to tow the company line.

114
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:15,280
And that's really, that is really our bottom line. So aggregate and promote, I would say,

115
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,280
that's how we work together with our brothers and sisters in mainstream media who again are under tremendous pressure.

116
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,280
It's almost like a media virus, you know, everyone knows exactly what to do.

117
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
It knows exactly how to treat the audience.

118
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Condescendingly, I might add most of the time, but it's not their fault. It's the system.

119
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,280
They're all our brothers and sisters. Some of them, you know, one hundred is a psychopath.

120
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,280
Those are the ones that usually wind up becoming president or prime minister.

121
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,280
And I'm not joking about that.

122
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:50,280
And that, of course, pulls in more psychopaths into government, the justice system.

123
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,280
Not all of them are bad, but the rest of them have to tow the line.

124
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,280
Got it, got to do, got to survive. That's all what we're all doing.

125
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
We're all just surviving.

126
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,280
On, yeah, you'd almost call it a prison plan.

127
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,280
I know it's not original, but it's kind of funny how a, a proposal it is.

128
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Anyway, I didn't really want to start off with that.

129
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,280
I, well, it does have a little bit to do with my first topic for today.

130
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,280
And that is about a blog post that I read written by Tim Borkin.

131
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Tim is the founder.

132
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,280
I believe with his brother, but I think he's really, he's really the guy that's run it all.

133
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Tim Borkin is the founder and CEO of the new media expo, which took place last weekend in Las Vegas.

134
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
I did not attend this year.

135
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,280
I certainly could have, I considered it more than more than once.

136
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,280
In fact, I had an idea to take a buddy of mine out to LA from LA out to Vegas.

137
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,280
We could hook up in Vegas and have some fun and hang out.

138
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,280
Because that's really what it's always been about for me.

139
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,280
I haven't attended every single year, but certainly the first one.

140
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,280
And I never saw a business benefit to the new media expo, not for the business that we're in.

141
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:07,280
Anyway, so Tim, I have a tremendous amount of respect for him for what he's been doing and what he's been building.

142
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
He's an entrepreneur.

143
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,280
And I have massive respect for that.

144
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,280
Anyone who tries and follows the dream and trying to do something and build something.

145
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,280
And literally with his bare hands is great.

146
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,280
So kind of disheartening to read his five reasons why he's thinking about quitting the trade show business.

147
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,280
And he goes on to list a whole bunch of things.

148
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
I can just give you the top line.

149
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,280
Of course, links in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

150
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,280
One, high speed internet costs.

151
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Of course, you get ripped off when you use a convention center type of scenario.

152
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Something called drag, which I don't think if that's the way you pronounce it.

153
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
I'm very familiar with it.

154
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,280
It's all this convention stuff is all unionized.

155
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,280
And you can't touch your box.

156
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
And I've been through that.

157
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
It sucks ass.

158
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Pay to play mentality.

159
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Very interesting.

160
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
This is probably one of the hardest parts.

161
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,280
I mean, this is a business.

162
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,280
It's, you know, this trade show stuff is a real business.

163
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,280
And it works in a certain way.

164
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,280
And typically, you know,

165
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:15,280
you'll have, you'll have vendors who will say, you know what?

166
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,280
We'll buy a booth and we'll sponsor.

167
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,280
But it's, you know, buy booth if our VP or CEO, whatever can speak.

168
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
So, you know, it's kind of a deal.

169
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:30,280
And in fact, that was, we had a little chat about that before the very first podcast

170
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,280
and new media expo when the word podcast was still attached to the property.

171
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,280
Where we were asked to sponsor.

172
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,280
I think it's like $25,000.

173
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,280
And we were offered a keynote slot.

174
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,280
And I said, well, not really interested in speaking.

175
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,280
Because I don't really see the benefit.

176
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
And I think it would be, you know,

177
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,280
more like a whole year than that type thing.

178
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
You know, I want to come and hang out.

179
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,280
But, you know, also, I really don't see the benefit of it.

180
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,280
You know, honestly, I just don't see the business benefit.

181
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,280
You see the benefit of hooking up with people who work with our network,

182
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
now, mevio, then pod show.

183
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,280
And, you know, so we threw a party.

184
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,280
And, but we've always made sure that we've always gotten a return on our money

185
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,280
in the form of programming.

186
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,280
So, everyone that we sponsored or paid for to go out and hang out,

187
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,280
basically, was always associated with the programming that had to be delivered.

188
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,280
And everyone made shows and delivered on that.

189
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,280
And otherwise, it was pretty much about how do I make money.

190
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,280
And that's really the crux of the issue.

191
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:46,280
Because there really is no money in the so-called pod casting industry.

192
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Michael Gohagan says, he says appropriately on his blog.

193
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,280
Michael Gohagan, one of the early pioneers,

194
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,280
he was a great radio, I think.

195
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,280
And I tried to hire him, by the way.

196
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,280
He didn't want to, he didn't want to do something on his own.

197
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,280
So, that's a cool lot of respect for him.

198
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,280
He says, pod casting is not an industry.

199
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
It's a community.

200
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
And that's absolutely true.

201
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,280
And that's the way we've treated it.

202
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
And so there's a problem right there.

203
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
It's not an industry because, you know,

204
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
really, when it comes to vendors, you know,

205
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,280
what's a vendor for a podcaster, you know, Apple?

206
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,280
I think he had like Microsoft and a couple other big companies come in

207
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,280
and have some booths, but I don't know if they really have the goods.

208
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
I mean, it's kind of freaky, you know,

209
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,280
it's like the NAB, the National Association of Broadcasters.

210
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,280
They have a convention.

211
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
Yeah, the vendors, you know,

212
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,280
there's tons of expensive and really cool automation

213
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,280
shit and, you know, it's very different.

214
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,280
We really don't need much more on a laptop and a bit of software.

215
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,280
You know, how many vendors are you going to get?

216
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,280
So, but also,

217
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,280
it's really about one thing.

218
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,280
You know, how do we make money at this?

219
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,280
And as I was reading around, you know,

220
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,280
obviously I looked at a couple of views,

221
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Paul Colligan, how to review.

222
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,280
And it sounded like a lot of the sessions were good and very helpful.

223
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,280
But, you know, that can almost be like a pod camp or,

224
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
you know, you don't necessarily have to put together.

225
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
I mean, it's really the whole vendor thing,

226
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,280
I think, is where it sucks because you have to play

227
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,280
by stupid rules, old fashioned way of doing stuff.

228
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,280
So, I want to say something about making money,

229
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
but first I want to wrap it up and say to Tim,

230
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,280
you know, dude, you've totally got it in your fingers.

231
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,280
You know how to build stuff.

232
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,280
And I think, yeah, you probably should quit the trade show business

233
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
and I hope you didn't get too burned on the new media expo.

234
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
I know that the numbers weren't, you know,

235
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
I know the number of attendees wasn't quite what you wanted.

236
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
At least I've read that.

237
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,280
And, you know, a lot of people bailed on speaking with sucks.

238
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,280
But I think you should quit it.

239
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,280
You know, why don't you change that to reinvent it?

240
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
I really think you can.

241
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
I really do think you can.

242
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,280
And I think that, you know, you'll find ways to make money,

243
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
but it's just not in the traditional way.

244
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,280
It's just not how it's going to work with hotel rooms and all that crap.

245
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,280
And maybe Vegas was just, you know,

246
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,280
I understand why I understand that it makes so much sense

247
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
and business plan to make that jump.

248
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,280
And then it's very disappointing.

249
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,280
But if anyone's going to change the trade show business,

250
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,280
it's going to be you.

251
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Now about making money.

252
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Michael Gohagan wrote extensively about this.

253
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Now I'm not going to preach one way or the other.

254
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,280
But I do want to say one thing about something he wrote on his blog.

255
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,280
I think it was in reference to the expo.

256
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,280
Says that, you know, the only sponsor of podcasting is GoDaddy.

257
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,280
So let me just say a couple things about that.

258
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,280
First of all, I met Chris from GoDaddy.

259
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,280
I met Chris from GoDaddy at Nomedex,

260
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
which was many years ago.

261
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,280
And which just goes to prove the point, you know,

262
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,280
I wouldn't have known her if she hadn't come up to me and was talking

263
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
and we were chatting for a while.

264
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,280
It wasn't until about 45 minutes that she handed me a card

265
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
and said, you know, we should hook up.

266
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
And the time now is like, I'll goDaddy.

267
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,280
I don't know my name, guys. Okay.

268
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
Interesting.

269
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,280
But she was very, very smart.

270
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,280
And Nomedex, not the conference itself,

271
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,280
but the hanging out part, which is why I like getting together

272
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,280
hanging out, hey, I'll buy the beer anytime for that,

273
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
which we've done.

274
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,280
We've bought the beer many times,

275
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,280
particularly at hookups like the expo.

276
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,280
Because that's where good shit comes out.

277
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:41,280
And goDaddy is not a sponsor.

278
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Okay. This has to be really understood.

279
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Because now here we are four years into the lifetime of my company

280
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
and we're still going.

281
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,280
And even though times are a little bit challenging,

282
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,280
certainly for advertising,

283
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,280
the part of our business that we consider to be transactional

284
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,280
is extremely successful for us and the people working with us on our network.

285
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,280
And because I know a lot of these people really don't,

286
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,280
for whatever reason they rarely speak up.

287
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Actually, that's not true. They do,

288
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,280
but the most vocal voices are the ones that are loud and complaining

289
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,280
and many of them.

290
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,280
And it kind of drowns out the success stories.

291
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,280
And we have certainly 200 programs

292
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,280
and produces associated with those programs.

293
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,280
Audio and video who are doing very well on our network.

294
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,280
And it's for two reasons.

295
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,280
So let me talk about the transactional business.

296
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,280
What we've discovered and not we as in me,

297
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
me, via or whatever.

298
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,280
But what we have collectively discovered is that

299
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,280
our audiences who are really our customer, who are our client,

300
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:01,280
are so loyal that they will buy things through you.

301
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:06,280
With full disclosure, knowing that if you use checkout code

302
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,280
and DSC3, you get your domain name from GoDaddy for 695

303
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
for a year.

304
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
And then I get a piece of that.

305
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,280
That's fully disclosed, everyone understands it.

306
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
It's not really advertising.

307
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,280
It's actually super advertising.

308
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,280
Because you're only going to do this if it's relevant to your audience.

309
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,280
You can package it any way you want to.

310
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,280
In fact, I just didn't add right there,

311
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,280
without even really making it not about the content.

312
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,280
It just fits right in, right?

313
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,280
And with the proper support,

314
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,280
we have five people working on our transactional business

315
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,280
who support the campaigns continuously.

316
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,280
That means supporting the producers,

317
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,280
but also, and we don't just have GoDaddy.

318
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
Let me give you a couple other examples.

319
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
We have pet meds.

320
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
We have e-music.

321
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
We have budget rent to car.

322
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
We have Drobo.

323
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,280
And all of these are transactional deals.

324
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,280
And really, it's almost like QVC needs a weird version of MTV, if you will.

325
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,280
The way QVC works, which is the piece that is a part of our maintaining of the campaigns,

326
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,280
is we have now developed a system where we can vet the right company,

327
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:28,280
which includes something that the audience will probably already want to buy

328
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,280
or we'll be in the market for.

329
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
So there's a lot of research that goes into that.

330
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Then we need to go and acquire the best deal,

331
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,280
not just for our customers, for our audience, because it has to be anything else anywhere online.

332
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
It has to be the price.

333
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
And boy, give you a difference.

334
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,280
It's a Nokia with the Nokia N10 promotion man.

335
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
We were fighting Amazon all the way down.

336
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
It was amazing.

337
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
And Nokia worked with us.

338
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,280
If it's got to be the best price anywhere.

339
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
It's got to be cheaper than Amazon.

340
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Otherwise, it won't work.

341
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
That's the system.

342
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,280
So with GoDaddy, you can't get a cheaper anywhere else.

343
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Except perhaps from some other podcasters.

344
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,280
But then again, here's where it comes into play.

345
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,280
We can deliver in volume, because we have a system.

346
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,280
We have a support.

347
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Yeah, a support and management team for these campaigns.

348
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Yeah, it's a lot of work goes into it.

349
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:33,280
And then, of course, we ensure that our producers get the highest bounty of all of these deals.

350
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,280
So it's really, we're doing a lot of business to make this work.

351
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,280
We, of course, profit.

352
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,280
And it's really what you might call a rev share.

353
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:48,280
And we also spend money on marketing our shows that are part of these campaigns.

354
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,280
And this is about to become a million dollar a month business.

355
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
And this is big.

356
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,280
This is really, really big.

357
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,280
And particularly, if you get the formula right.

358
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,280
And the cool thing is, you can do this on your own.

359
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Or anyone can join mevio and join in campaigns.

360
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,280
When we're not quite ready to accept them, just saying that.

361
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Because, you know, we want to be careful, because it is a lot of work.

362
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,280
And the teams are already pretty strapped on what we got going now.

363
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,280
So they're not just sponsors.

364
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:28,280
It is a new version of being an intermediary between the producer of a product,

365
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:38,280
whether it's a physical, real product or virtual, like GoDaddy.

366
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:43,280
Yeah, it's, I said, just lost my train of thought there for a second.

367
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,280
But it's working.

368
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,280
It's really, it's really what we proved early early on with the sense sale.

369
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
I sold a lot of sense sale machines.

370
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
And it was clear that it was working.

371
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,280
So this is something new.

372
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,280
And I don't want it to just be poo pooed as, well, you know,

373
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,280
if GoDaddy wasn't around, then no one would be making any money.

374
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,280
No doubt about it.

375
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,280
If GoDaddy fell over tomorrow, it would suck massively.

376
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,280
But there are more companies getting into this and more brand names,

377
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,280
as highly, highly, highly interesting.

378
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,280
Now, just in the other side, the only other way we're able to monetize at the moment on video.

379
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,280
And by the way, the transactional business works best in audio,

380
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,280
but particularly works well if someone does video and audio together.

381
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:40,280
It's also much easier for us to promote video and send people who are interested in the topic of the show over there

382
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,280
to watch some things.

383
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,280
So it's just for a number of reasons, including technical and industry standards.

384
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,280
It's just much easier.

385
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Has to do with flash players, not it's very frustrating.

386
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,280
But also it's just two different media forms.

387
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,280
So some is appropriate, some isn't.

388
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,280
And just so you know, the only other way that we're making money,

389
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:07,280
which is now really starting to crank up and we're seeing some advantages of the economy crunching,

390
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
is we're selling it just like television.

391
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
And then honestly, that's what the media buyers want.

392
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
They want it just like television.

393
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,280
And it's pretty roll in its 15 seconds,

394
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,280
and it's totally not related to the content,

395
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,280
and it's old fashioned, and it's dominant interruptive.

396
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,280
But that's what's going on.

397
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:31,280
And honestly, I got very tired of trying to tell people holding the check that they were going about it the wrong way.

398
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,280
That's not a good way to build a business.

399
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Doesn't mean that we don't have ideals in the when advertisers start to experiment,

400
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,280
and maybe change their ideas and minds that we won't be there for them and ready because we will.

401
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,280
And we've had lots of adventurous advertisers who have already jumped on board and tried stuff.

402
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,280
But at the end of the day, it's about massive reach.

403
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
It's about repetition.

404
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,280
And it's about that being pre-rolled and on video.

405
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,280
I just want you to know that that's what it is.

406
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,280
And for that, you really need to be part of a network one way or the other.

407
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:14,280
But for transactions, anyone, I mean, look, I know, I know guys who are making hundreds of thousands of dollars.

408
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:20,280
And they're working very hard because, you know, you've got to be communicating with the audience offline as well as online.

409
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,280
In other words, not just through your show, but you've got to follow up.

410
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
It's a shitload of work.

411
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
I'm lazy.

412
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,280
I'm happy I don't have to do it.

413
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Still, I mean, there's thousands of dollars that are being accredited to the daily source code on a monthly basis.

414
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
I don't get it.

415
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,280
Of course, it goes into the pot.

416
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,280
And I'm not doing anything.

417
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,280
You know, when's the last time I talked about budget rent at car?

418
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:49,280
I mean, I always say go to the show notes and you can see all the deals there and their fantastic deals.

419
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,280
And the system works.

420
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,280
And you can do it with relatively small audience.

421
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
Really, you can.

422
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
And that's what makes it beautiful.

423
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,280
But even better, you don't have to.

424
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,280
You can find any place to upload your stuff and build your audience.

425
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,280
You don't need to be making money.

426
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,280
You can just do it for whatever reason you want.

427
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,280
Okay, crap.

428
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
How long have I been talking?

429
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,280
Let me just see.

430
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
What is that?

431
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
Shit 20 minutes.

432
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
I got so much to go through today.

433
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
I'm never going to make it.

434
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,280
All right.

435
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,280
Let me play this from from the candy man.

436
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Here we go.

437
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
Hello, Adam.

438
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,280
It's candy man speaking here.

439
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
It's time with the kids for the audience.

440
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,280
How to make better use of this trophy.

441
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,280
Voice mail.

442
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,280
Yeah, that's something that I'm glad you bring that up.

443
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Candy man.

444
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,280
The drop.au slash daily source code, which is such a valuable resource.

445
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,280
I wish those drop guys would put a search in.

446
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,280
Because so many times like, oh, I know there's something here.

447
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,280
I want to find that file that posting.

448
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,280
It'd be great if we could have that search.

449
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,280
So I'm sure that they're thinking about that.

450
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,280
And I've already tried to have Google.

451
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Google search didn't work.

452
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,280
I guess it doesn't crawl it or whatever.

453
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,280
But yeah, it's it'd be very awesome.

454
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,280
If you can send your voice mail through to drop.au slash daily source code.

455
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,280
And so the bummer about it is you got a first dial the number.

456
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
Then you have to dial an extension.

457
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,280
And so Luke has a little solution to that candy man.

458
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,280
Hey, line.

459
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,280
Because this this five digits code that you are.

460
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
We're sharing.

461
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
Yeah.

462
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,280
And two zeros in code.

463
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
So it's an extension code.

464
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,280
So that's also why you see in the.

465
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,280
X between the number and the and the five digits code.

466
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
So that's.

467
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
Expansion code.

468
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,280
And the actually it's quite easy to use that.

469
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,280
If you program.

470
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,280
The drop.au phone number into your phone.

471
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,280
Then you add a P for pause.

472
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,280
And pressing.

473
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
Nokia phone.

474
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,280
You can find the P under the.

475
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Under the star button.

476
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,280
When you are a programming.

477
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
Okay.

478
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
I'm listening to your memory.

479
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,280
And then you add this five five digits extension code.

480
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,280
So your phone will then just dial the drop.au.

481
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Okay.

482
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
So it dials the number.

483
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,280
And then it'll actually pause before it hits the.

484
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,280
The DMTF tones or whatever.

485
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
Well, it's not number.

486
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,280
It's with a weight for a while because of the P.

487
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
DTMF.

488
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
I'm sure.

489
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,280
So the post for the.

490
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Let's a collection to be established.

491
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,280
And then it will start dialing the extension number.

492
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
And your.

493
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,280
Or two other medical.

494
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
To do.

495
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,280
Or smell books.

496
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,280
So not the real.

497
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
Problem in mild being.

498
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,280
If you just program the whole thing.

499
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,280
Into your phone.

500
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,280
All right.

501
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,280
It's one number.

502
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Then it goes quite smooth.

503
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
I get it.

504
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
I know.

505
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,280
That was a.

506
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Use.

507
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Can you man.

508
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,280
Can you.

509
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,280
Can you.

510
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
Thank you so much.

511
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
Love.

512
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Love my Nokia phone.

513
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
By the way, the E71.

514
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
Which I bought.

515
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Instead of the iPhone.

516
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
God.

517
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
I love this phone.

518
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
Several times a day.

519
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,280
I say, I'd love this fucking phone.

520
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,280
I really do.

521
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,280
A couple of things.

522
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,280
I don't like about it.

523
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
But that's not for today.

524
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
I got a move on.

525
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,280
Okay.

526
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
All stuff from drop.au today.

527
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,280
Drop.au slash daily source code.

528
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
This is.

529
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,280
This is from truth out.org.

530
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,280
Tiedless Georgia war, a neocon election.

531
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
Play.

532
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
This is.

533
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
Here's the interesting.

534
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,280
Part in this.

535
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,280
I actually read the lead in paragraph.

536
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,280
Is it possible that this time the October surprise was tried in August.

537
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:29,280
And at the garbage that the garbage issue of brave little Georgia struggling for survival from the grasp of the Russian bear was stoked to influence the US presidential election.

538
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
Woohoo.

539
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,280
Before you dismiss that possibility, consider the role of one Randy.

540
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Shonen man.

541
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
I think it's hype enough.

542
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
It's shown in mom.

543
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Sierra Charlie Hotel Echo uniform November echo.

544
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,280
Mike Alpha November November.

545
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,280
Shonen mom.

546
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:52,280
For four years, he was a paid lobbyist for the Georgian government who ended his official lobbying connection only in March.

547
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Just months after he became.

548
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
Wait for it.

549
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,280
Republican presidential candidate John McCain's senior foreign policy advisor.

550
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,280
He could better.

551
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,280
Previously, Shonen mom was best known as one of the neoconservatives who engineered the war in Iraq.

552
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
That's a big statement there truth out of the org.

553
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:16,280
But they say they engineered the war in Iraq when he was a director of wait for it again.

554
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,280
The project for a new American century.

555
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,280
It's unbelievable.

556
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:29,280
He was Shonen mom who after working on the McCain 2000 presidential campaign headed the committee for the liberation of Iraq which championed the US invasion.

557
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,280
And you got to read this article.

558
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
It's just amazing.

559
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,280
I mean, all these ties are not coincidental.

560
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,280
It's just impossible.

561
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
It's.

562
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,280
It almost makes you laugh.

563
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,280
And this, I got to play this for you.

564
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,280
This is from Fox News.

565
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,280
This is a YouTube video.

566
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,280
And these days, I'm just hooking and straight into my.

567
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,280
Into my Ableton live set up, so I can play this for you live.

568
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,280
This is fantastic.

569
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,280
I don't know if this is even true.

570
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
But you got it.

571
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
All right.

572
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
Here's that cell phone story.

573
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,280
And by the way, Shep Smith, I love this guy.

574
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,280
What a cheap robot head.

575
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
All right.

576
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Let's go waiting for cell phone users.

577
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Beware big brother.

578
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Maybe listening.

579
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:17,280
The federal bureau of investigation can now hear everything you say.

580
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,280
Even when the cell phone is turned off.

581
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,280
I know it sounds kind of out there.

582
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:27,280
When using your phones tracking device authorities can now activate the microphone inside the dreaded thing.

583
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,280
Allowing them to eavesdrop on you and your conversations.

584
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,280
So we've decided to start saying all kinds of weird stuff all the time.

585
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
But hero.

586
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Not really.

587
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
Seriously.

588
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,280
Yes.

589
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,280
I use this form of surveillance to keep.

590
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,280
Let me guess.

591
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,280
Terrorism.

592
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,280
Tabs on critical conversations by people.

593
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
They call no members of the mafia.

594
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Oh, that doesn't sound like people talking to foreigners.

595
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,280
That doesn't.

596
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
That sounds like a violation of the Pfizer act.

597
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,280
Experts say the only way around it is to take the battery out of the thing.

598
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
Okay.

599
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
I've heard this story before.

600
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,280
I've heard similar stories.

601
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,280
But now there's actually reporting on it.

602
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,280
You know what?

603
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,280
I have a hard time believing this one.

604
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,280
First of all, I mean, is it for all cell phones?

605
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:16,280
I mean, that means these guys have back doors into every single operating system and every cell phone.

606
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,280
Can that actually be true?

607
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
Candy man?

608
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,280
What is Nokia's position on this?

609
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Are you selling me phones that even when I turn it off?

610
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
The government can tap into.

611
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280
But can only be.

612
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,280
Well, actually, can also be in the chips.

613
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,280
It could be embedded directly into the chip.

614
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,280
But someone's got to know about that.

615
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:42,280
So there's the same on Windows as it is on Symbian or on the Apple iPhone operating system.

616
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,280
You know, I'd like to know.

617
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,280
Is that really true?

618
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
You know, this is a big claim.

619
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,280
The FBI is saying it according to Fox News.

620
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:55,280
So I wouldn't mind hearing hearing about that one.

621
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,280
And again, I'd heard about this and I know you can buy programs.

622
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:07,280
You can even buy cell phones online that will answer phone calls.

623
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,280
This is like the, you give this to your husband or wife if you think they're cheating on you.

624
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,280
And it'll answer a call without actually ringing or out giving a notification.

625
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,280
And it'll just turn on the microphone.

626
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
You can listen in.

627
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,280
So you can always call and listen at any time.

628
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,280
One vibrate, nothing.

629
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:32,280
And if someone wants to use the phone, it'll automatically disconnect to like stealth mode.

630
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,280
So with that's an application that you actually have to put in.

631
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,280
So there must be something at the OS level or even at the chip level.

632
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,280
The hardware.

633
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,280
So if you have any info, let's hear about it.

634
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,280
And also I presume that this thing would then be radiating.

635
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,280
And it would be talking to the tower.

636
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,280
Now we should we should not just pass that by.

637
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
I'm so happy with this next story.

638
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,280
And I'm going to believe this one immediately.

639
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,280
You've probably read this or heard about it.

640
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:07,280
I just want to make sure I told you and gave you the link on daily source code.com.

641
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,280
This is the story about Michael Phelps.

642
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,280
Not actually winning the seventh gold medal at the at the Olympics.

643
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:23,280
And you could find this at 100th of a second.com, 10000 TH of a second.com, 100th of a second.com.

644
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:29,280
And so you know, Michael Phelps beat his opponent.

645
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,280
Kavik Chavik, I think it is, by 100th of a second.

646
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Except the photo finish shows something else.

647
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,280
The photo finish shows, is he serving?

648
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,280
I think he's serving.

649
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,280
Millerard.

650
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:51,280
This show Millerard clearly, Millerard Chavik, Kavik clearly touching first.

651
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Unfortunately Phelps is sponsored by Omega for a couple years now.

652
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:07,280
And Omega also does the timing, a clear conflict of interest, but also does all of the timing for the Olympics, at least for the swimming.

653
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:13,280
And I'll just point out that Kavik beat Phelps in qualifying in the semi-finals.

654
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:21,280
And when you read that this page is great, this is a great aggregation of all kinds of mainstream media stories.

655
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,280
That really show that this thing stinks.

656
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:33,280
And by the way, I can clearly you can see that according to the FINA rules, Phelps has to have both hands touching the pad simultaneously.

657
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,280
That certainly didn't happen.

658
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,280
And as sure it looks like he just hits second.

659
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:45,280
But obviously you can see the importance of this guy winning, not just a time mark spits his record, but he wanted to beat it.

660
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,280
You know, there's a lot of money involved.

661
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,280
He has to be a winner.

662
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Look at the poor Chinese guy, the athlete who he pulled a hamstring.

663
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,280
I mean, the country is destroyed, his contracts are shit.

664
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,280
You know, this poor poor child.

665
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,280
There was something funny about Omega.

666
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Let me just see if I can find it.

667
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,280
Shit, where was it?

668
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,280
They used an interesting, oh, here it is.

669
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,280
This is where this is from.

670
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,280
This is from fitness, own brochure.

671
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,280
In 1995, Omega, a fitness.

672
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Omega.

673
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
One more thing.

674
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,280
Omega combined timekeeping with information technology.

675
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,280
Introducing A-R-S-A-R-E-S.

676
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:36,280
The automatic recording evaluation system, combining a black box, chronograph unit that captures

677
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:42,280
and prints time from sensors in the pool with a computer that can process the data and make it available

678
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:48,280
to the outside world without compromising the security of the black box.

679
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:54,280
What marketing genius wrote that?

680
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,280
Oh, that's crazy.

681
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,280
Also on the Olympics.

682
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
And this is from the New York Times.

683
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,280
If you hadn't heard about this.

684
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,280
China names of Olympic women's giant gymnastics team on Friday.

685
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,280
This is, uh, what was this post at July 27th?

686
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,280
And had the inclusion of at least two athletes has further raised questions.

687
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
Why spread in the sport?

688
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,280
Apparently they were 14 and not 16.

689
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,280
So I just want to say that what I've always thought.

690
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,280
And it's a shame, really, because the athletes are really in it.

691
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,280
And we sit at home really, you know, rooting for our favorite athletes.

692
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,280
I love the Dutch field hockey women's team.

693
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
God, I don't give a shit if they win or lose.

694
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
I just like watching them play.

695
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
It's it's beautiful.

696
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,280
Um, it's a scam.

697
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
It's a big fucking scam.

698
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,280
It's a big commercial bullshit money grubbing scam.

699
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,280
And it's bad for the athlete to participate.

700
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,280
It's bad.

701
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,280
They're just evil.

702
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,280
And they're lying to us and they're showing a shit.

703
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,280
Absolute horseshit.

704
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Now, if you can't even do the score.

705
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,280
I mean, uh, just makes me sick.

706
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,280
It's exactly what I thought exactly why I said a boycotting stupid Olympics.

707
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,280
I don't want to talk about them because they're crooked.

708
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,280
And the people in the IOC are suspicious.

709
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,280
It's a lot of politics going on with this stuff.

710
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,280
A lot of money involved.

711
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
Okay.

712
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,280
All right.

713
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
Let's move out of that hole.

714
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Part of a program or come on in, buddy.

715
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
I did.

716
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,280
It's a political program I hear from San Francisco California as usual.

717
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,280
Yeah.

718
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,280
I was in DSC 701 where you said that the bad was sheriff.

719
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,280
Uh, per business sheriff.

720
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,280
The.

721
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,280
Now, former president of Pakistan.

722
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,280
It turns out that he has a home in because he'll make Maryland outside.

723
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,280
Washington DC.

724
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,280
It's not also in DC area.

725
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,280
I know this because my cousin similar lives in the water area.

726
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,280
I knows the guy.

727
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,280
Anyway, that's all.

728
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,280
Cheers.

729
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,280
I'm very out.

730
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,280
All right, P.P.

731
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
Thanks, man.

732
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
I thought the guy.

733
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
Well, the guy is certainly a said.

734
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
You know, I got no money.

735
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
I got nowhere to go.

736
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
I don't have a big fancy house.

737
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,280
So I guess I was bullshit.

738
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Looks like, I mean, you got a house in Maryland in the DC area.

739
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
That's nice.

740
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,280
That's nice.

741
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,280
Oh, I'm so worried about all that shit going on over there.

742
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,280
I really, really, really bugs me.

743
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,280
New report that came out.

744
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,280
I've not verified everything.

745
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,280
But I just did want to read this to you.

746
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,280
This proof of global warming hype published.

747
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,280
Okay.

748
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,280
So I'm still looking for the published bit, which, of course, is.

749
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,280
I just haven't had the time to look everywhere to find it.

750
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
I will.

751
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,280
Mathematical proof now that there's no climate crisis has been, has been published.

752
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,280
In a debate on global warming in physics and society, a scientific publication of the

753
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,280
36,000 strong American physical society.

754
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,280
So that's the part I need to verify.

755
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:16,280
So this is basically debunking the IPCC report, which has resulted in us being taxed on carbon emissions,

756
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,280
which, by the way, when I open my fat trap, that what comes out is carbon.

757
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
Okay.

758
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:27,280
CO2, the trees and the plants breathe that shit.

759
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
It's being taxed.

760
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,280
You watch one day, you got to talk less.

761
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,280
You got to pay more CO2 tax.

762
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,280
The article entitled Climate sensitivity reconsider demonstrates that later this century,

763
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,280
a doubling of the concentration of CO2 compared with the pre-industrial levels,

764
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,280
will increase global mean surface temperature, not by the six Fahrenheit,

765
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,280
six degrees Fahrenheit predicted by the IPCC, but harmlessly,

766
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,280
little more than one degree of Fahrenheit.

767
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,280
And they go through this hole.

768
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,280
Let me just read you the revelations in the paper.

769
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Right.

770
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,280
So this is against the report, though, the IPCC 2007 climate summary,

771
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,280
which brought us into all of these extra taxes.

772
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
So this is science, right?

773
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
This is science against science.

774
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,280
Highly interesting.

775
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
So let's just run down.

776
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:25,280
The IPCC's 2007 climate summary overstated CO2's impact on temperature by 500 to 2,000%.

777
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,280
After our models and every model is built on a certain number of assumptions,

778
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,280
the same in business, by the way.

779
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,280
The CO2 enrichment will add little more than one degree Fahrenheit, 0.6 degrees Celsius,

780
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,280
to global mean surface temperatures by 2,100.

781
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
Got that?

782
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,280
That's 90 years from now.

783
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,280
Not one of the three key variables whose product this climate sensitivity can be measured directly.

784
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,280
Interesting.

785
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,280
The IPCC's values for these key variables are taken from only four published papers,

786
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,280
not from two and a half thousand, I guess, as previously stated somewhere.

787
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,280
The IPCC's values for each of these three variables and hence for climate sensitivity are overstated.

788
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:12,280
Global warming halted 10 years ago, and surface temperature has been falling for seven years.

789
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:18,280
Not one of the computer models relied upon by the IPCC predicted so long and rapid accooling,

790
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,280
which I guess is saying that their models are off and don't make sense.

791
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,280
Like this one, the IPCC inserted a table into the scientist's draft,

792
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,280
overstating the effect of ice melt by 1,000 percent quite an error.

793
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:37,280
It was proved 50 years ago that predicting climate more than two weeks ahead is impossible.

794
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,280
I don't know what kind of proof they have, but interesting they're saying it.

795
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,280
Mars Jupiter Neptune's largest moon and Pluto warmed at the same time as Earth warmed.

796
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Oh, that's a good one.

797
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
How do you measure that shit?

798
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:56,280
In the past 70 years, the sun was more active than at almost any other time in the past 11,400 years.

799
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,280
There you go, go figure.

800
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,280
Something's warming up a little bit because of the sun.

801
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,280
I like mathematical proof.

802
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:09,280
I'm not sure what's going to come next, but obviously keep in my eye on this one because you know I don't buy that.

803
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,280
I really don't buy it.

804
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,280
I would not buy much from Al Gore.

805
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,280
Alright, hey, UK folks, how you doing?

806
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,280
I got some news for you guys.

807
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,280
This blew me away in the times.

808
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Okay, this is is the times online, but the times highly respected newspaper in the United Kingdom.

809
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,280
Headline fat children should be taken from parents to curb obesity epidemic.

810
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,280
Yes, grossly overweight children may be taken from their families and put into care.

811
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:47,280
If Britain's obesity epidemic continues to escalate according to council chiefs yesterday.

812
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,280
Council chiefs are, and this was, this is August 16th.

813
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,280
So this is earlier in the week.

814
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
These are people that run the councils like Gilford Council.

815
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,280
So I guess they're a part of it.

816
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:06,280
The local government association are you that parents who allowed their children to eat too much could be as guilty of neglect as those who did not feed their children at all.

817
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:18,280
You know, this is exactly what the Lisbon treaty prescribed as part of the new human rights, which once they ram it down our throats and totally disrespect Ireland and the Netherlands and France.

818
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:32,280
It says that if the government feels it's necessary to do to have children exposed to better education, they can take your children away from you.

819
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:39,280
Here you go, the news articles just a little bit too soon because well the Lisbon treaty ratification is a little bit delayed.

820
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:46,280
So they didn't quite time it perfectly, but here it is.

821
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,280
Now, of course, thank God there's some people who are fighting against this pretty balanced article.

822
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,280
You should take a look at that.

823
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,280
But obviously, you know, that's not the way to fix the problem.

824
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,280
And the problem is is to get people eating healthy.

825
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:08,280
I talked about this with Patricia. She's like, well, how it makes sense. She says, you know, this is exactly what happens. You know, good food is too expensive.

826
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,280
People got no money. It's getting hard.

827
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:19,280
So they buy crap. And by the way, the healthy food isn't advertised on television. The crap is I'm loving it.

828
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:30,280
Right down into the programs, right into East Enders, highly watched program in this country, not by intellectuals. I must say I'm a fan myself.

829
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:35,280
Let's get some nuggets. Finish your nuggets, love.

830
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,280
That's some other frightening statistics in this.

831
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:48,280
In fact, councils are spending tens of thousands of pounds widening crematorium furnaces to deal with fatter corpses.

832
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,280
God.

833
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,280
Shit. Standard coffins are between 16 and 20 inches wide. That's 40 to 50 centimeters.

834
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,280
But coffins twice that size are being ordered to fit larger bodies.

835
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:09,280
Oh, my God. New ambulances have been introduced across whales with special equipment for fat patients, including a winch and an extra wide strength and stretcher.

836
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,280
We're killing ourselves people. We're eating ourselves to death.

837
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,280
Oh, my God.

838
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Ah, I got to play a song. This was not exactly the spot I had to play. I just got to play some.

839
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,280
Oh, my God. I got to chill for a minute.

840
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,280
Process.

841
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,280
This was left on the drop.

842
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,280
Giles on the letter to Bush on your daily source gun.

843
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,280
Oh, my God.

844
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,280
Oh, my God.

845
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,280
Oh, my God.

846
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,280
Oh, my God.

847
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,280
Oh, my God.

848
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,280
Oh, my God.

849
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,280
Oh, my God.

850
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,280
Oh, my God.

851
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,280
Oh, my God.

852
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,280
Oh, my God.

853
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,280
Oh, my God.

854
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,280
Oh, my God.

855
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,280
You sit there in your home.

856
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,280
You're making decisions forever and forever.

857
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,280
When you get so confused, you can turn the time went down.

858
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
The light's on the line.

859
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,280
Oh, my God. Trust you.

860
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,280
I don't know you just don't look like you know it.

861
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,280
If all you say, oh, you just keep your heart straight.

862
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,280
Just look at the place that's way to play.

863
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,280
Oh, my God.

864
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,280
Oh, my God.

865
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,280
Oh, my God.

866
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,280
Don't help us all.

867
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,280
Oh, my God.

868
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,280
Oh, my God.

869
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,280
Oh, my God.

870
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,280
If I were you I'd leave the thinking to those of us who are higher I can.

871
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,280
They're struggling.

872
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,280
The power of the faith was simply too much.

873
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,280
Or I'd deal with like you.

874
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,280
Think it's up you go home.

875
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,280
All I did out catch me a fish and it'll all know it.

876
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,280
Daddy please tell me what you got to do.

877
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,280
I keep on fishing if I were you.

878
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,280
Oh, my God.

879
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,280
Oh, my God.

880
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,280
Oh, my God.

881
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,280
Oh, my God.

882
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,280
Oh, my God.

883
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,280
Oh, my God.

884
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,280
Oh, my God.

885
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,280
Oh, my God.

886
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,280
Oh, my God.

887
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,280
Oh, my God.

888
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,280
Oh, my God.

889
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,280
Oh, my God.

890
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,280
Oh, my God.

891
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,280
Oh, my Lord.

892
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,280
Oh, my God.

893
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,280
But you know where it goes

894
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,280
You say you're looking at you, keep your arms straight

895
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,280
Just look at the mess that's made of clay

896
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:51,280
You're going to be on the floor

897
00:46:51,280 --> 00:47:01,280
You're going to be on the floor

898
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,280
Ah, Jail's led up to Bush

899
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,280
That's a badass axe work there

900
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,280
I'd be like the sound of the guitar

901
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,280
It's why I played it I guess from the source code drop

902
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,280
The drop.io slash daily source code

903
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,280
Okay, let's see what we have here

904
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,280
It's just going to fade out

905
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,280
Yeah, another fade out

906
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,280
Ah, that's weak

907
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,280
I don't like fade out

908
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,280
Okay, a couple more things here

909
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,280
One more for the UK folks from the register

910
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,280
I just love this man

911
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,280
Just one more about your government

912
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,280
And mine I guess here in the UK

913
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,280
UK government to spend hundreds of millions on snooping silo

914
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,280
The government is pressing ahead

915
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,280
With plans to spend hundreds of millions of pounds

916
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,280
That's the twice as many hundreds of millions of dollars

917
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,280
On a massive central silo for all UK communications data

918
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,280
It's called IMP

919
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,280
The interception modernization program

920
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,280
That's right, go get the IMP

921
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,280
The team has recently been expanded

922
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,280
And a director level official appointed to run the project

923
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,280
Which is not yet official policy in public

924
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,280
Read that on daily source code.com

925
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,280
I just push in ahead my friends

926
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,280
I just push in ahead and we're standing by

927
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,280
And you know what I don't know if it's floor right in the water

928
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,280
Or what's going on?

929
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,280
We're just letting it happen

930
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,280
And the more of us that wake up

931
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,280
And start talking about it the better

932
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,280
That's all you really have to do

933
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,280
It's just talking about it

934
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,280
Tell you friend, tell you neighbor

935
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,280
And it's everywhere

936
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,280
It's everywhere

937
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,280
Here, Italy

938
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,280
Also from today

939
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,280
I'm sorry, July 16th

940
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,280
Just showed up on the drop

941
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,280
Italy may demand all its citizens to be fingerprinted

942
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,280
A move aimed at diffusing widespread criticism

943
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,280
Of government plans to force Roma people

944
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,280
And their children to provide fingerprints

945
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,280
As a way of tracking criminality

946
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,280
So the people in Rome don't like it

947
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,280
Then if I get everyone will do it

948
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,280
And we're going to get everyone to it

949
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,280
That policy has been condemned by the European Parliament

950
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,280
By Romania where many Roma come from

951
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,280
This is all about immigration

952
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,280
And of course the religious groups who have compared it to the tagging of Jews

953
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,280
By Nazis and fascists in the 19th

954
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,280
Of course it's fascist

955
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,280
It's fucking crazy

956
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,280
It's no worse than identity cards

957
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,280
It's all the same

958
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,280
It's all you know who gave these guys the right

959
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,280
They work for us

960
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,280
Really kind of take this back

961
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,280
They work for us

962
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,280
Let's pop over to my old hometown

963
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,280
And Jersey actually not exactly my hometown

964
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,280
But it would have affected my hometown

965
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,280
Ah

966
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,280
New Jersey now requires flu vaccines for preschoolers

967
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,280
And children attending licensed child care centers

968
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,280
The flu vaccine requirement along with three additional immunizations

969
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,280
Doesn't say what they are was approved in December

970
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,280
According to the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services

971
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,280
Studies suggest that young children are particularly effective

972
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,280
In transmitting influenza to their close contacts

973
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,280
Yeah it's sometimes it's good

974
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,280
You know you build up resistance

975
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,280
I do not like the idea of the government

976
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,280
Shooting shit into children

977
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,280
Not our children

978
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,280
I do not like this idea at all

979
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,280
And we should not stand for it

980
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,280
Excuse me

981
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,280
This should be reversed

982
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,280
This is really really bad

983
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,280
And what are these other additional immunizations

984
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,280
There's three more

985
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,280
I'm going to play a little bit of a YouTube video that

986
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,280
That was sent to me just because

987
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,280
I've seen to required if you're headed to war

988
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,280
But target five discovered that a frightening number of US service men and women

989
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,280
Are having severe reactions

990
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,280
Including a young marine from Claremont County

991
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,280
So this is from

992
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,280
It's a news five

993
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,280
It's an NBC affiliate

994
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,280
And where are they?

995
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,280
I probably can't

996
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,280
See where they're from without

997
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,280
Shit

998
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,280
WLWT TV

999
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,280
My question where they're from

1000
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,280
I just want to I won't play this whole thing

1001
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,280
I just want to get the you have to get the gist of it

1002
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,280
Because it's an official news outlet

1003
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,280
And these are these are like real reporters

1004
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,280
They know fluff piece

1005
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,280
Listen to it

1006
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,280
It's difficult for real

1007
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,280
At a time when young men and women

1008
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,280
Are dying on the battlefield

1009
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,280
We live in a very volatile time in the military

1010
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,280
There is an enemy here at home

1011
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,280
And no one wants to move back

1012
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,280
It's not as shot from a gun

1013
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,280
This is the worst cover of

1014
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,280
In the history of the military

1015
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,280
But a shot from a syringe

1016
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,280
That's leaving some US service men and women

1017
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,280
On the brink of death

1018
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,280
I mean it's very, very dramatic stuff

1019
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,280
Of course the way it's positioned

1020
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,280
But the story is indeed quite dramatic

1021
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,280
So just let me tell you what it is

1022
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,280
They the government is

1023
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,280
Vaccinating our soldiers

1024
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,280
Our boys and girls going over to Iraq

1025
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,280
And by now some have been around

1026
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,280
So long have been this fucking worst

1027
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,280
So long they're men and women

1028
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,280
Boys and girls men and women

1029
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,280
Children of the sun

1030
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,280
Literally 18, 19 year olds

1031
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,280
Sun children

1032
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,280
Goddesses all of them is horrible

1033
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,280
These are highly intelligent beings

1034
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,280
They're the next generation

1035
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,280
They've grown up with Facebook

1036
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,280
Imprinted on their mind

1037
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,280
They understand networks

1038
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,280
Technology, socializing and whole new ways

1039
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,280
And we're sending them off to throw hot

1040
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,280
Let it each other

1041
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,280
Poisoned by depleted uranium

1042
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,280
And we're testing them

1043
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,280
We're using them as guinea pigs

1044
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,280
They're being inoculated

1045
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,280
And they're dying

1046
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,280
Thousands of them

1047
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,280
And the shit is being kept secret

1048
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,280
It's not being recorded

1049
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,280
And it's being covered up

1050
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,280
And that's what that video is about

1051
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,280
And now we're going to do it to our preschoolers

1052
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,280
And kids entering school for the first time

1053
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,280
Sucks

1054
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,280
Really, really fucking sucks

1055
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,280
So the highly aware of your government

1056
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,280
Trying to shoot shit into your veins

1057
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,280
Okay, they've already got the lock on heroin

1058
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,280
And that's for another show for another day

1059
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,280
How do you get it from Portland?

1060
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,280
Well, there's another dead super delegate

1061
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,280
Stephanie Tubbs, Jones, State Representative

1062
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,280
From Ohio

1063
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,280
Supports Hillary Clinton in the spring

1064
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,280
In Dorses, Barack Obama

1065
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,280
In June

1066
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,280
And his dead August 20th

1067
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,280
2008

1068
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,280
Why to wake in Germany?

1069
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,280
Yeah, I got a lot of email about this

1070
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,280
One after we looked at

1071
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,280
The previous Democratic official

1072
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,280
It was also super delegate

1073
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,280
It was murdered in Arkansas

1074
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,280
Now I haven't had the time to look into Stephanie Tubbs

1075
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,280
Stephanie Tubbs Jones, I guess, is our full name

1076
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,280
Haven't been able to look into it

1077
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,280
But even what I've just the couple of things I've seen

1078
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:07,280
Is that this woman was a great representative

1079
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,280
And I think she was a congresswoman

1080
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,280
She was a congresswoman

1081
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,280
And a super delegate

1082
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,280
Very African-American I just want to make sure you understand that

1083
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,280
She was very important for her community

1084
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,280
Respected and loved

1085
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,280
And I do not like the way this went down in the reporting

1086
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,280
There's lots of reports on this

1087
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,280
Here's what I've collected

1088
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,280
Again, just aggregating from the mainstream news reports

1089
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,280
She was driving her car

1090
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,280
High speed, I don't know

1091
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,280
It didn't come across like a high-high speed but speeding

1092
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,280
And erratically

1093
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,280
They were able to maneuver her off to the side of the road

1094
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,280
I did see the pictures and video

1095
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,280
It wasn't no crash

1096
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,280
Apparently the car stopped

1097
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,280
Not by force, I didn't see any dense or anything

1098
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,280
And the word is that what happened

1099
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,280
She was driving got an aneurysm

1100
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,280
And I'm not quite sure how that works

1101
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,280
Usually we get an aneurysm

1102
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,280
You're not going to be driving

1103
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,280
If you're either driving her stop and if you're incapacitated

1104
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,280
It's not both

1105
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,280
And I didn't see any forceful stopage signs

1106
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,280
She was then taken to the hospital

1107
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,280
Where and that's when reports came out that she was dead

1108
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,280
But then the new reports came out saying

1109
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,280
No, no, no, no, she's okay, she stabilized

1110
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,280
She's in serious condition but stabilized

1111
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,280
And then the report that they unplugged her life support system

1112
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,280
At 12, 10 AM

1113
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,280
That night they unplugged her life support system

1114
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,280
From an aneurysm

1115
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,280
Dude, Terry Shivos that hooked up to a fucking machine for years

1116
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,280
They couldn't unplug

1117
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,280
They unplug this woman's machine in a couple hours

1118
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,280
A DSC or in Cleveland rights

1119
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,280
This is public on the drop

1120
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,280
I live about two miles from the intersection

1121
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,280
Where the report where the representatives car came to rest

1122
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,280
After an officer noticed the car's erratic driving

1123
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,280
Some sort of helicopter came extremely close to the rooftops

1124
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,280
It was flying fast and low to the hospital

1125
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,280
Headed towards the crash she

1126
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,280
It shook the house, my wife grabbed my hand

1127
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,280
Because it sounded and felt like it was landing on the house

1128
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,280
This happened before we heard the news

1129
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,280
Was it military?

1130
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,280
It didn't seem to leave

1131
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,280
I don't think it was life flight

1132
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,280
Did it land at the hospital?

1133
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,280
Interesting

1134
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:33,280
I think she was taken to the hospital by ambulance

1135
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,280
Of course I don't know what kind of helicopter it was

1136
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,280
But I've seen lots of lifeline

1137
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,280
It might have been a news

1138
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,280
If anything was probably a news helicopter

1139
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,280
That's probably what it was

1140
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,280
I'm not associating anything there

1141
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,280
Anyway, the local TV newsroom reported

1142
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,280
Local news in Cleveland, mainstream media

1143
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:56,280
The hospital was under lockdown after they brought the representative in

1144
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,280
Why?

1145
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,280
She was an avid Clinton supporter

1146
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,280
Who switched to support Obama

1147
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,280
This is going to be so fascinating next week

1148
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,280
With this convention, what's going to happen with the vote

1149
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,280
Although I cannot believe

1150
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:19,280
I see now that Lady Duroth child is now using her lid

1151
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,280
I think is her first name and her maiden name is Forster

1152
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,280
She's now using her maiden name everywhere

1153
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,280
She's fighting the good fight for Hillary Clinton

1154
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,280
Now it's just billionaire Lynn Forster

1155
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,280
She's dropping the Roth child

1156
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,280
Which of course is good because Baron Roth child

1157
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,280
Donated funds to John McCain

1158
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,280
There's husband and wife

1159
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:45,280
Crossing both sides there

1160
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,280
They're right of course

1161
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,280
I don't think the Baron is an American so we can't vote

1162
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,280
But he could certainly support it whoever he wants

1163
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,280
Although there's question about the legality of his donation

1164
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,280
Maybe they want to make them fry them both

1165
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,280
I don't know

1166
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,280
Maybe Lynn Forster is really out to use Sir Clinton

1167
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,280
I don't know

1168
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,280
I really don't know

1169
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,280
I would think that the illuminati is what's called

1170
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,280
The energy elite

1171
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,280
The true owners of the earth

1172
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,280
It makes sense for them to support both

1173
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:18,280
It doesn't matter when they're both under their control at this point

1174
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,280
Well, maybe they want to get them both out of the way

1175
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,280
And have Obama win

1176
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,280
No, I don't know

1177
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,280
I don't know

1178
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,280
This has, however, been

1179
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,280
Here we go

1180
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,280
I'll read this to you

1181
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,280
Tubbs Jones becomes the third African American woman in Congress to die

1182
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,280
In the deadliest term of Congress in over 20 years

1183
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,280
Eight members of Congress have died during this term

1184
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,280
Tubbs Jones began a term in 1998

1185
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,280
Was one of Senator Hillary Rotten Clinton's biggest supporters during the primaries

1186
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,280
Was a co-chair on Clinton's campaign

1187
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,280
She announced her support for Barack Obama in June

1188
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,280
And was a super delegated next week's Democratic National Convention in Denver

1189
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,280
Ooh, chilling

1190
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,280
I, we should look into that

1191
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,280
Eight members of Congress died in this

1192
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,280
And the deadliest term ever in over 20 years

1193
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,280
I love that we should look into that one

1194
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,280
For sure

1195
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,280
I'll put a couple more links on the drops you can read them

1196
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,280
And let me see

1197
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,280
Okay, I'm just going to do two more. I'm going to skip over one thing here

1198
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,280
Now, I'm not going to do that

1199
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,280
I was going to do a whole government and drugs thing

1200
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,280
I'll leave that until the next time

1201
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,280
I will promote because I was planning on doing that

1202
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,280
Downsized.org

1203
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,280
A true you work for us website

1204
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,280
One press of the button

1205
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,280
A can fire off

1206
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,280
All kinds of documents, faxes, emails

1207
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,280
To your representative

1208
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,280
Excuse me, it's a total automated system

1209
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,280
Really good helps you get your complaints in

1210
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,280
Because you know, that's what it's for

1211
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,280
You're supposed to call your congressman

1212
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,280
Now you can do it

1213
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,280
They can't ignore this stuff forever

1214
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,280
Nor will they

1215
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,280
They just can't

1216
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,280
If they look, look at the FBI

1217
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,280
They have to now go back and show more evidence about Bruce Ivins

1218
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,280
Which they can't because they destroyed the evidence

1219
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,280
Everyone knows the score now

1220
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,280
Another notch in the belt

1221
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,280
Final one, I just want to

1222
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,280
And this is great and awesome news

1223
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,280
I got an email from Brian Cox

1224
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,280
Shit, sorry about that

1225
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,280
I don't at least I blew my ear drums out as well

1226
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,280
I got an email from Brian Cox's wife

1227
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,280
Brian Cox is a, he's a physicist

1228
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,280
He's a rock star

1229
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,280
He's working on the large hatred collider

1230
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,280
It's certainly Switzerland

1231
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,280
And his wife, who is a fox by the way

1232
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,280
Damn

1233
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,280
She pointed out to me that he did this awesome speech at Ted

1234
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,280
And it is, it's fantastic

1235
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,280
And you know what?

1236
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,280
If anyone is going to discover a new energy source or something

1237
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,280
Spectacular, it's going to be this guy

1238
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,280
And I really hope he does because man

1239
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,280
I would buy a second hand card from him any day

1240
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,280
And it sounds extremely exciting

1241
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,280
And you know, this, wow, man, he's living his dream

1242
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,280
He's very, very excited about what he's going to discover

1243
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,280
About the creation of the universe

1244
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,280
But also I believe in alternative energy form

1245
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,280
Someone's going to come up with that

1246
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,280
It could be this guy

1247
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,280
If you really want to hear a good explanation

1248
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,280
You won't understand all of it

1249
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,280
But you'll feel much better

1250
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,280
When you listen to this Ted speech that Brian Cox did

1251
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,280
