23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You can't do it

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's no joke, you can't do it

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I find it's way life

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Baby, you can't see our face

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, no

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All this machine

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Remaking my feelings

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Still be a fan of it

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Not so foolish, all that you need

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't let it go

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're honestly

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, you're honestly

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What a nice, what a name

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And we don't want music

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And what a literary mind isn't

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And he is compromising

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Charity, you can't have a different day

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
應

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
but

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Resisting

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's copy an English

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
pie

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Make it for me

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Mothin only

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Damn him I don't try to explain

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That really gives me the light of knowledge.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
These moves are prepared for the break host.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oil!

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's all about the twerking on the step of your wall

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's got a hole

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know where the sound is

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It just makes sounds like that anymore

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Sorry, this does not exist

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Rush and the spirit of radio

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
On your daily source code episode number 807

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Hey everybody, how are you doing? What's going on?

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
A show on a Monday? Oh no! Something must be a miss

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah, like I got my schedules kind of sorted out

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
My shit back together

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Bring you more than just one or twice a week

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Doing my dawn is that's for sure

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And the big move of 2008 has commenced my friends

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We now have an empty television viewing room

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's the first thing to go

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And once again all alone here in the the manor

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The lady Patricia's still on her show business business

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
In the lowlands, she won't be returning until tomorrow

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And coming up in just a couple days

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We get the keys to the new place

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Still not sure whether I'm going to call it

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The curry terrors or curry square or something like that

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So it's just the other place for now

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And then we start loading it up

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And man, I did a lot of work over the weekend

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Of course Lady Peenie, not being here

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I had some a lot of time

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Basically to mess around and do stuff

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And been working on some chroma key experiments

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Because I want to have a set up in the new place

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
As I've told you before, going completely minimalistic

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Very little outboard gear, just one nineteen inch rack with stuff

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That I might need, you know, and I'm really going to pick and choose

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Everything else is going, there'll be nothing other than one mixer

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And a lot of monitors

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's for sure

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And then I literally want to paint one wall blue or green, I guess

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So that I can, with fixed lighting

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Then there's some really cool new products out there

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They really make the lighting of green screen

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's incredibly easy

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Because I got some video shows now in mind

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
As I said, I've been back, I've been getting into the creative half of the brain

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
A lot of those sales calls

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Does not involve that portion of the grey matter

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The stuff I've been doing for the past month

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So I've got some cool ideas

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm looking forward to sharing that with you guys

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Of course, the big news today

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This being Monday, November 24th, 2008

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Is that the US government has sent in the cavalry

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
To the rescue of City Group

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This of course is, you know, the Miss City Bank

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But it's a lot more than just City Bank

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The American government now guaranteeing up to three hundred and six billion

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Dollars in problematic assets

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And an additional twenty billion dollars

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Injected in capital straight into the bank

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Because this is, quote, too big to fail

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And this is just another piece of the unraveling of the facade

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Really, I guess that's not the right expression

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes, there's a huge facade

115
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But the unraveling would be more like a pool

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
One little string and just keep pulling until the entire

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Entire sweater has a reverted back into a ball of yarn

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's kind of what it feels like

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
As you now can see that this bailout has failed horribly

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The actual money that has been spent on the tarp program

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Tub troubled asset relief program

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Including all loans, guarantees, and money given directly

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Is now about five trillion dollars

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay, that's more than half of what the United States national debt already was

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So it's just added on top of all of that

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And it's not going to work no matter what they try

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's just all going to come falling apart at the seams

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And I think essentially the call has been made

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Just look at what the G20 did two weekends ago

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Mainly the European countries they said okay

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We're going to kind of put together our own monetary system

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We got a new idea it's all going to be based on

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
On the finite number of carbon credits

134
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Everyone will be every transactional most will have carbon taxes attached to it

135
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And we'll give the United States one hundred days to figure out if they want to join in

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's essentially what it is because there is

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well, there really are no secrets

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is what I've said for years just information you don't yet have

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And it's just not being reported properly

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Because well the United Kingdom of course there's many more important things

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's why they don't hear about much what's going on

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The most important thing of course is I'm a celebrity get me out of here

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The the eighth season by now is in full swing

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's fabulous to watch

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
12 million people I believe per evening watching

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Which is a pretty big number for UK television statistics

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You might miss something really important

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Well you're doing that for instance

149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I think it's this is from Yahoo

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But the Daily Mail has really been doing some great reporting recently

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is originally from Sky News

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
10s of thousands of police officers across the country

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is the United Kingdom are to be given access to taser guns

154
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Help tackle violent crime

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And it's pretty interesting how this is being perceived here

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's hey, you know, we're really proud that our cops in the UK

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't carry guns

158
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
They only carry tasers

159
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Well let me tell you

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Although of course guns easily kill people

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
When in the wrong or untrained hands

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The whole concept of a stun gun really frightens me

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And there'll be 30,000 cops

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
By this time next year walking around the UK with these stun guns

165
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Because it's much easier to pull this out

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Since you're probably not going to kill the person that you're going to taser

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The psyche of the law enforcement officer

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's just going to change. We've already seen this in the United States

169
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
People are being tazed, left and right for all kind of you

170
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If you are struggling against resisting arrest

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
They get five guys that talk high and that throw you in the back

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And now they tas you

173
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So now it's even with a little bit of resistance you might get tazed

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And it's just really lowered the bar for

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
For the, what is the word I'm looking for? What is the phrase?

176
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Well just just a more treatment of us like animals

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's basically a cattle prong is what it is

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Or prod whatever you call that

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And it's amazing to me that there's no huge outrage in the United Kingdom

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This is the kind of stuff that is now rampant in the United States

181
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The country used to desperately do not want to be like

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And you're letting it happen

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Here's more. This is from the Daily Mail

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You've got to see this picture

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This is the links of course in the show notes of DailySourceco.com

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And cross posted at curry.com

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Motorists will face amateur speed traps run by local volunteer groups

188
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
In towns and villages across the country it was revealed yesterday

189
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And there's this great picture of

190
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
A well intended of course citizen

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Holding a radar gun at a passing automobile

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And he has a very typical UK safety jacket on

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Which is the yellow one with the silver reflecting stripes

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
They wear those jackets here in the UK for every reason

195
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
No matter what you're doing you got one of these jackets everyone's got one

196
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I've got like 10 of them

197
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Not for a community speed watch

198
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Which is not neatly stamped onto the back of this

199
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Community speed watch

200
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And they're going to it's a form of deputization

201
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You'll get three warnings

202
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If the community speed watchers catch you

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And then after that you'll get a visit from the police

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And it's really it's just a start of a

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Of a of spying on each other

206
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
They've already been doing this here in the United Kingdom with your trash

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
If someone puts their trash out on the wrong day

208
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Or if they're putting

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
If they they're mixing up their recyclables

210
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Or if they're doing something highly legal

211
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Now there's all kinds of numbers now that you can call and you can rat out your neighbors

212
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Hopefully you see that this is a very very bad idea

213
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And if you don't want to go down the path

214
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The United States has gone down my fellow Brits

215
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
There's definitely something that needs to be done about this crap

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I want to thank whoever posted the the Awakening Advertised PDF

217
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
On to the drop drop.au slash daily source code

218
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's fantastic. I love this. It's essentially a poster

219
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Big words of the top awaken your ears

220
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And there's kind of like a silhouette of picture of me

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But it's funny because you can actually stick this to like

222
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You know any any wall surface

223
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It has those little tear-off strips

224
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Which I guess you have to pre-cut when you print this out

225
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
With the URL daily source code dot com

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And underneath that it says warning not daily which is very funny

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Are the government lying to us can energy be free is the economic bailout pointless

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Our carbon credits the new money is Obama for real

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
X MTV VJ Adam Curry explores the truth behind the illusions that fill our world in the daily source code

230
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
At least once weekly podcast

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Filmed with music fun and ranting on all subjects like Australian porn

232
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's not in there, but it is true from London to San Francisco to your ears

233
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Daily source code dot com paid for by students for the propagation of Adam Curry's podcasting

234
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Thank you

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
highly appreciated

236
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And still looking for more Aussie porn which clearly does not exist

237
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
All right, so

238
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I think that if you if you spend any time watching CNBC or maybe even Bloomberg

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Or if you you know if you really watch any real financial programming on mainstream in the mainstream media

240
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You're already starting to see the hints now of stuff that we've been talking about on this very program for months

241
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Maybe even a year

242
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
About how

243
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
How the dollar eventually will just become worthless overnight

244
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And you can never relate and I'm going to explain to you why later on there's more great news that come from

245
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Lindsey Williams we've talked about on the show a lot

246
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
How how this bailout is of course a complete scam

247
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And all of the real world assets are now essentially being owned by the banks

248
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Please do not make the mistake thinking that the United States owns these banks or own significant portions

249
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Of them it's really the other way around the banks are really owning the United States government

250
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And a lot of that or just about all of that is thanks to

251
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
This horrible central banking system that has now rained its terror on the entire world long enough

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And we're going to try and bring it into it because if not it'll bring it into us

253
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And I want to play some sounds for you

254
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And I want you to see if you can figure out what this is this is from a BBC news article

255
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Which of course I have the link on in the show notes

256
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
See if you can hear what this is

257
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Now what does that sound like to you sound like a protest of some sort?

258
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Thousands of people

259
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Well I'll let y'all off the hook that is protestors

260
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Clashing in hold on a second I didn't have my yeah

261
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
There we go

262
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Clashing in right-kivic with the police

263
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Because their economy has collapsed completely

264
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And this is like you know a western country civilized nation

265
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You have to understand that just because this is not happening in your backyard

266
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Doesn't mean that it's a not happening and that it absolutely could

267
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Now this is a very small community 300,000 people

268
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But they man they they were a big part of the banking of the interest rates with their own little central bank there

269
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
They're version of the federal reserve and it collapsed on them and they had no way

270
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
To go and fix that other than to borrow money

271
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And and so you know protestors gather outside the city's main police station

272
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
To man the release of a man jailed in a previous demonstration now they're getting really pissed now police using pepper spray

273
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
There's been a series of protests in Reykjavik calling for the government to resign over its handling of the economy

274
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Which of course they want to

275
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The government is now taken out of 4.6 billion dollar loan from the IMF the international monetary fund

276
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Which is exactly the way

277
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The European Union wants it to happen the G20 when they got together

278
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
They published their the results of their photo off weekend

279
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And they said hey, you know, we want the IMF to step up and be in the middle of it

280
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The IMF by the way has about 250 billion dollars

281
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's not like they're swimming in dough

282
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
But that'll all become clear when they introduce a new fiat currency a monetary unit

283
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Which I believe will be based on carbon somehow

284
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So that's the sound of

285
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Of an economy that is collapsed and people not being able to buy the types of food that they want

286
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Because the grocery stores are not carrying it anymore

287
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
They can't get the credit for their supply lines

288
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And this is a lot of bad crap that's going on

289
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And it is because of the central banking system

290
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And there's many, many videos and informational pieces

291
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Floating out on the internet

292
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You can just Google how does the Fed work or even better

293
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Maybe go to endthefed.us

294
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
As a big demonstration was held in 39 cities yesterday across the country to end the Fed

295
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The Federal Reserve which just so you understand is a private entity

296
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Now it has been sanctioned by Congress and the Federal Reserve Act of 1913

297
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I believe which as far as I'm concerned is unconstitutional

298
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'll tell you why in a second

299
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
To basically print and handle the United States's money

300
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And we have to borrow it back from them paying interest

301
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And the Federal Reserve whose exact members are unknown

302
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Because they have complete secrecy

303
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
They are not obliged to tell you or the government anything

304
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
About what they do or how they do it

305
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Witness the bailout to the $2 trillion in loans

306
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Which have been given or this is just a tally from a couple of weeks ago

307
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
When Bloomberg the news agency

308
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Requested on the Freedom Information Act

309
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Information about what troubled assets were put up as collateral against this

310
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
These $2 trillion in loans

311
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Our money given by the Federal Reserve

312
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
They said hey that's not here business

313
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And we don't have to tell you go read the paperwork

314
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Screw you

315
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Now of course we do know that the banks who have been bailed out

316
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Are happily continuing with their bonuses

317
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But it's really not in these guys

318
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The guys just dickhead shills that are playing along with the game

319
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
They're their pawns almost

320
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I mean we're smaller and less meaningful pawns

321
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Certainly individually

322
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But the banks just a piece of the real global system

323
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Which is the central bankers

324
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Those guys are the ones that are now raken in all the real stuff

325
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
All the real goods

326
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Everything you hear about a giant liquidation being in process

327
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That's right

328
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Everyone's selling everything they got

329
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Selling what they have

330
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And that doesn't have to be mean just stocks and bonds

331
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's real assets

332
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm being offered stuff for purchase left and right

333
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
At amazing prices

334
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Stuff I absolutely do not need

335
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So the excesses are essentially coming to an end

336
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And the whole system is unwinding

337
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And nothing can stop it

338
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Because at the end of the day no one controls the market

339
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Except for the

340
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The controlling of interest rates

341
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Which of course is total market manipulation

342
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But you can see how the market is responding

343
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And city bank which is rumored to have

344
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
$800 billion in deposits

345
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You know there's stock tanked on Friday

346
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And yesterday they got this bailout

347
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Guaranteed the faith and credit of the United States

348
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm not quite sure how much longer it's going to last

349
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So yesterday let me get back to the end of the Fed

350
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Was held in a number of cities around the nation

351
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
At Central at Federal Reserve banks

352
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And in Houston Dr. Ron Paul congressman

353
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And presidential candidate

354
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Said a few words on stage

355
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I just want to bring this video up for you

356
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I just want you to hear a couple important things that he said

357
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So I have no idea how many people were there

358
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But the stage looks pretty big

359
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And seems like there's plenty of people there

360
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
So it's there all lots of signs saying support HR2755

361
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Which is a bill that is being proposed to actually end the Fed

362
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Or reserve

363
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
A lot of events like this throughout the country

364
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And this should be very significant

365
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
We won't be on evening news tonight

366
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm quite sure that's interesting

367
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Because this did actually show up on the evening news

368
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'll play that in a second

369
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Just listen to what Dr. Paul has to say

370
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
On the country

371
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
But we are on the evening news

372
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Every single night

373
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Every single day we're on the minds of the people

374
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Every single day because

375
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
There is a crisis in this country

376
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
One of it's not worse than the crisis of the depression

377
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
At 30s

378
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And that's on handlessly

379
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And we know who caused it

380
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It was the Federal Reserve

381
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
All right

382
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
There you go

383
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So it did make it onto the evening news

384
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I have just one example

385
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
This is I believe NBC in Chicago

386
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's definitely a local

387
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh man, what's the matter now?

388
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Come on baby

389
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I can't wait to get to the new place

390
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And have really internet this sucks so bad

391
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Now what it just stopped now?

392
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Christ

393
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
This whole show is based upon

394
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Cool bits from the internet

395
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And I don't have any internet

396
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I got no internet

397
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
All right

398
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Well I'm waiting for that to be restored

399
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Why don't I read to you from the United States constitution

400
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So I mean this is the beautiful thing about the United States

401
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
He's at the very young country

402
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
At 235 years whatever

403
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And our founding fathers, the elders

404
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
They came up with a really easy document to understand how this was going to work

405
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Because one of the reasons the United States split off from the United Kingdom

406
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
was because of the central banking, the whole idea of banking

407
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And we've had presidents close the central banks

408
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And only for them to reopen again

409
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And presidents speak up and I'm talking about a Jefferson Hamilton

410
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You had Abraham Lincoln who invoked the Greenback

411
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And was assassinated

412
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You have John F. Kennedy

413
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Who did that famous speech before the Foreign Press Association

414
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
He said hey man we got secret guys and they're making up secret rules

415
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And this is no good

416
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
He was referring to the bankers

417
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Assassinated

418
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Of course it did not go unnoticed that the end of the Fed day

419
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Was held on the 45th anniversary of JFK's assassination

420
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
The United States constitution section eight

421
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
This is regarding the powers that Congress has

422
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Congress has the power

423
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
To, well, let me give you a couple of these

424
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
To borrow money on the credit of the United States

425
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Okay, that's Congress

426
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Not the Federal Reserve which is not

427
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
An official part of government

428
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It's not a branch. They called it federal reserve

429
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Because federal sounds kind of official doesn't it

430
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Just like federal express

431
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Although that is not a part of the United States government

432
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm sure that the government uses federal express a lot

433
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But doesn't mean that it's actually a part of government

434
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Congress has the power to

435
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Coing money

436
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin

437
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And fix the standards of weights and measures

438
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I take this stuff pretty literally

439
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
To coin money so you can make coins

440
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Not paper but coins

441
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And it's not like the concept of paper money

442
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Wasn't around when this was written

443
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
But they wrote it specifically

444
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Because they meant coin

445
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And to regulate the value thereof

446
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So that's for the Congress to do

447
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Now, that's outsource this

448
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
This happened in 1913 with the Federal Reserve Act

449
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
The outsource it

450
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And the Federal Reserve is now doing all of that part

451
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Of the Constitution

452
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Including the

453
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Regulating of the value thereof

454
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Now if it was really being done in Congress by Congress

455
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Then it would be transparent

456
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
We know it would be going on

457
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And we'd be able to have an opinion about it

458
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And change that through our elected representatives

459
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That's no longer the case

460
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's been that way for almost 100 years

461
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And it is time to change that

462
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And the more you look into how the Federal Reserve works

463
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm just going to give you a couple of these hit words

464
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The Federal Reserve but also Federal Reserve banking

465
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That's a big one

466
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You really got to look at how that operates

467
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Then you'll see that as bankers have stated

468
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And you can find these quotes everywhere online

469
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
They'll tell you right off the bat

470
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
They'll say you know what

471
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I don't need to control any laws

472
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I don't have to write the laws of any country

473
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Just give me control over the money

474
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And everything else just falls right into place

475
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
That is exactly what central banks do

476
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
That is why they need to be abolished

477
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It should happen globally a good place to start

478
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Because we have an official document

479
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
We have the law of the land

480
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
The Constitution of the United States

481
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Now available by the way

482
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
On the Google G1 G4 Marketplace

483
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
A handy little booklet can be obtained from any library

484
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It fits in your shirt pocket

485
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's the way the land should be run

486
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Run

487
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That's what we agreed to, not even that long ago

488
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
In the fed.us

489
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Jesus

490
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Hi animatismat from Gamesweasel

Clambering over each other to get all the presents they need

493
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000

Where I'll be reviewing Gears of War 2 on the Xbox 360

497
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Where is Edge on the PlayStation 3?

498
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You'll get a nice little red alert 3 music video

499

And you can win copies of Sonic

500

Unleashed on the Xbox 360

501
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
That's all the gamesweasel.com

502
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Now I'm at thank you very much

503
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I gotta go figure out if I can get this internet working

504
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And I do have a couple more things I want you to hear

505
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Otherwise we'll have to pause recording

506
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
By the way the market

507
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Gained about 3,400 points at the end of the day

508
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
On Friday when Timothy Geitner was announced

509
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
As the Obama's pick

510
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Or Secretary of the Treasury

511
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
What does that tell you?

512
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
They love this guy of course

513
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
He's a member of the whole system

514
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
He'll make them money

515
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Doesn't care about you or I

516
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Oh we love it

517
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
One of our owners chosen

518
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yeah, party boys

519
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Yeah

520
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yeah

521
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Yeah

522
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah

523
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yeah

524
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Yeah

525
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yeah

526
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah

527
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yeah

528
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah

529
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah

530
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah

531
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah

532
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yeah

533
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yeah

534
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah

535
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah

536
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah

537
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yeah

538
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yeah

539
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah

540
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Yeah

541
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Yeah

542
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yeah

543
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,960
Yeah

544
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And sleep with one eye on me

545
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
With me your pillow tight

546
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And send lies

547
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And no lies

548
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
See my hair

549
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'll never never lay

550
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Tick off

551
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Oh-ho-oh-ho!

552
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Tick off

553
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

554
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Oh-ho-ho!

555
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh-ho-ho!

556
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Oh-ho-ho!

557
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

558
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:10,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no shoot, sir, sir, Sirsby, sirsby, sirsby, sirsby, sirsby.

559
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,620
And don't you hurt

560
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,620
It's just a piece and a your bed

561
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,620
And you call it in your head

562
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,620
It's in life

563
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,620
And don't I

564
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,620
Break your sin

565
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,620
It's in life

566
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,620
And don't I

567
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,620
Break your sin

568
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,620
It's in life

569
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,620
Break your sin

570
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:14,620
It's in life

571
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:22,620
It's in life

572
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,620
It's in life

573
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,620
It's in life

574
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:49,300
All right, nothing like hammering out a little bit of Metallica on a Monday, huh?

575
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:56,380
Enter Sandman on your source code episode eight zero seven, let me see if this is working

576
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,380
out.

577
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,140
I've got the back up link working out.

578
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,140
Here we go.

579
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,500
Ah yes, it might work.

580
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,940
This is from Chicago News.

581
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,940
It's a U.S.

582
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:11,620
We're auction.com, the bidding resumes at 9.30 tomorrow morning in Rosaline.

583
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,780
Thanks for the great for the people losing their homes, of course, and a related story.

584
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,340
Major protests in cities across the nation today.

585
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,500
They rallied against the Federal Reserve here in Chicago.

586
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Dental traders are calling for a dismantling of the Fed.

587
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,900
And the Fed also does not look better.

588
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,940
Activists believe the Federal Reserve Bank is responsible for the current financial crisis.

589
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,980
The government failed out for further disrupting economy and plunged the nation into a severe

590
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,980
depression.

591
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:44,300
They support legislation introduced by representative Ron Paul to shut down the nearly century

592
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,460
old Federal Reserve Bank.

593
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,060
Other news now, where there you go.

594
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,820
We believe the Federal Reserve is responsible.

595
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,940
Yes, we do believe that because they literally control it.

596
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,100
That's what interest rates are all about.

597
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,300
They control inflation and deflation.

598
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,860
And now has just gotten out of control because there's nothing left.

599
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,020
There's nothing left except the real assets we own.

600
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:14,780
So, oh, man, it's almost, it fits so in line with John C. DeVorex's cyclical nature of things.

601
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,620
And it's been about to 80 years.

602
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,620
So it's time.

603
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,620
Not just happening in the United States.

604
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,060
Oh, no.

605
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:31,340
The Swiss Bank, Central Bank, blue interest rates out by one full percent, 100 basis points.

606
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,180
I'm sorry, 1000 basis points.

607
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,660
And everyone's really pissed at UBS.

608
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,220
That's the biggest Swiss Bank.

609
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:46,500
And it's now begging the Swiss government for help.

610
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,580
And, oh, man, people are so angry about this.

611
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,180
And of course, it's the same thing.

612
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,940
The guys are getting huge bonuses.

613
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,780
They don't care.

614
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,180
It's the exact same thing.

615
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,540
It's happening everywhere.

616
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:08,740
Look at the links in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com, crossposted at curry.com.

617
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,740
All right.

618
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,740
So next in line, now that I've got my gold.

619
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,780
Because that's why I'm, and I'm just getting ready.

620
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,740
I'm telling you, you can laugh at me now.

621
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,020
Hear me now, believe me later.

622
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:27,020
Something weird shit is going to, I see amazingly wealthy people on interviews shows now.

623
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,580
What's the guy's name, Jim, shit?

624
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,500
Of course, they're all bit cookie, but they're very successful investors.

625
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,540
They're walking around with gold coins in their pockets.

626
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:40,740
You know, just in case, I'd like to emulate that, just in case.

627
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,220
Because you never really know.

628
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,740
And just in case, I'm going to get me a diesel generator.

629
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,860
I've been looking for one very difficult, by the way, to find a diesel generator.

630
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:55,060
Most generators these days are all gasoline-based, but I really want a diesel because if push

631
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:00,020
comes to shove, you can pretty much, you know, throw anything into the diesel tank as I know

632
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:04,660
from my own experiments on the Trinity automobile in San Francisco.

633
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:08,300
Still parked in the garage, by the way, never got rid of it.

634
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,140
You can pretty much throw anything at it, and it'll just work.

635
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:15,940
Daily Mail, once again, regular blackouts to hit Britain within three years, because there's

636
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:20,500
a shortage of new power stations, oh man, this country is so screwed.

637
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,140
Oh boy.

638
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,380
Never, they have to shut down these old nuclear power plants that, you know, they're

639
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,220
talking about building new ones.

640
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:34,700
The rush to build wind farms is not going to deliver the amount of energy actually needed.

641
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,700
And there's no plan.

642
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,100
And I've got this Jebroni Gordon Brown running the show, unelected.

643
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,940
Might want to add, unelected.

644
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,980
And of course, you know, he's the big financial guy.

645
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,460
Part of the whole system that got us into this mess in the first place, and now he's acting

646
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,460
like a hero.

647
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,460
That's out.

648
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,460
Okay.

649
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,500
But at the meantime, we'll just have no power.

650
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,420
And just when we thought it couldn't get much crazier with President-elect Barack Obama

651
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:09,980
announcing Timothy Geitner as his secretary of the Treasury, I'm not sure if this isn't

652
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:15,900
a rumor still, or if it is an actual appointment.

653
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,180
But it has been widely reported that former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack is being considered

654
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:26,300
for the secretary of agriculture position in Obama's administration.

655
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,580
Look up this guy.

656
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,180
And this is what I'm, this is what I do every day.

657
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,420
Now, I read about a new name.

658
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,340
And we, of course, didn't have to read about Hillary Clinton, just Google Hillary Clinton

659
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,220
or Clinton body count.

660
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,980
But a lot of foreign leaders are not going to want to be friends with her.

661
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:47,300
Friends of the Clinton usually turn up killing themselves, strangely.

662
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,100
But this guy, wait.

663
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,260
We have Timothy Geitner.

664
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:54,780
Now, if you look up what he's related to, he is the current president of the New

665
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,780
York Fed.

666
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:03,980
He's heavily involved in the failed bailouts that are taking place as we speak.

667
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:09,100
Just look at his history, counsel of foreign relations, it's all tied in, no wonder

668
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,340
the stock market just bounded up.

669
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,980
Oh, thank goodness this guy's in.

670
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:19,980
So if you like eating genetically modified organism as food, then you will love Governor

671
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,820
Tom Vilsack as our secretary of agriculture.

672
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,860
You know, I just don't see the change.

673
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:35,180
All I see is people who could come out of textbook New World Order as in, let's control

674
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:40,620
the money, let's have global governance, let's modify our food.

675
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,060
And there's even a, I linked to it in the show notes.

676
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:55,460
There's a nice little form that you can use to urge president elect Obama not to appoint

677
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,300
Governor Tom Vilsack as secretary of agriculture.

678
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,540
Let me just see what it says.

679
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,540
You'll like this.

680
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,260
I'll just read it to you.

681
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,700
And then you can decide if you want to fill it out.

682
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:10,180
Do president elect Obama, we, the undersigned, are urging you not to appoint former

683
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,500
Iowa governor Tom Vilsack as secretary of agriculture or any other positioning in your

684
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,300
new administration slap, take that Vilsack has been an ardent supporter of genetically

685
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,620
engineered pharmaceutical crops, especially pharmaceutical corn.

686
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:28,860
These crops pose huge risk to human health and the environment, absolutely.

687
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,860
We talked about this just the other day, 98% of all fast food in the United States can

688
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,180
be traced back to corn.

689
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,820
It's all just corn, but it's modified and it's high in fructose.

690
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,820
It's a starch crap.

691
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:45,300
I'm probably not saying the right words, but you know what I mean.

692
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:51,980
Vilsack is a noted proponent of unsuitable and dangerously genetically engineered crops.

693
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:56,740
Even the biggest, biggest biotechnology industry group, the biotechnology industry organization,

694
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:01,260
named Vilsack governor of the year, yeah, celebrate the man.

695
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,400
He was also the founder and former chair of the governor's biotechnology partnership, organic

696
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,320
farming does not allow for the use of genetically engineered crops.

697
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,320
The organic consumers association is opposed to genetic engineering and supports mandatory

698
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,840
labeling of genetically engineered foods, which is not, it's not mandatory so you don't

699
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,280
even know if you're eating it now.

700
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,360
Okay, so that's the change you've been looking for.

701
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:30,480
Go and have a look at that website and sign up if you feel right for it.

702
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:37,440
Now I just wanted to head back and once again say this is not just a US issue, this economic

703
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,920
malaise, it is not all just America's fault, and it's not just American industry that

704
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
is failing.

705
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:50,880
Now Jaguar, the automobile company Jaguar Land Rover turns out it's been holding

706
00:41:50,880 --> 00:42:00,440
secret talks with the government to plead for a 1 billion pound loan.

707
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,040
They have exactly the same problems as General Motors forward in Chrysler right now.

708
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,120
And this I think this is a good thing.

709
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Let's just stop buying stupid shit.

710
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,160
We don't need.

711
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,520
Let's just stop it.

712
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,800
And then, well, of course, what should happen is companies like, I hate to say it, but Jaguar,

713
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,480
it should just, and of course, it's now Indian owned by Tata, it should just fail.

714
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:32,160
And yeah, I'm really sorry, but you know, transportation is still needed, we're very creative

715
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,280
as a people will come up with new companies that will need people to work in them and

716
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,320
then we'll get started, but somebody has to get hurt somewhere.

717
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:47,480
And all I see is that small businesses going belly up, they're even doing on the morning

718
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,520
show here in the UK, they have a special report and they have a reporter drive around

719
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:57,080
to different cities and burrows and walks down what we would call the high street is

720
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,840
usually named the high street, which is where all the shops are.

721
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,440
And I'll say, oh, there's that one's clothes.

722
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,200
Oh, there's a shoe store used to be there.

723
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,200
That's closed.

724
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,400
And just talk about which, which different shops are closing.

725
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,640
I only see the small guys going out of business.

726
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,520
And in the United States, 75% of all business is small business.

727
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,000
So why should we be bailing out automobile companies?

728
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,320
Why?

729
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:30,040
And you want a great statistic, the economist last week, wrote this Volvo.

730
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,760
Now, this of course is a Swedish car, Volvo, not just car, but they make, well, they

731
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:42,680
make vehicles Volvo wins the prize for statistic of the credit crunch to date.

732
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:48,200
The Swedish firm said it had received a mere 115 orders for heavy trucks in Europe in the

733
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:56,320
third quarter, down 99.7% on the almost 42,000 order bookings during the same period

734
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,920
for 2007.

735
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,920
Damn.

736
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,160
So what are they going to do?

737
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,760
Are they going to get a bailout?

738
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,320
Is that what's going to happen?

739
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,480
It's crazy.

740
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,960
Now I know that President elect Obama, he can't do it.

741
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:20,680
He can't shut down, he can't let these, he can't let the auto industry fail.

742
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,040
He made a promise and he took a lot of money and a lot of support from the United

743
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:30,360
auto workers, which does not represent all of the automobile industry, but it certainly

744
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,080
does represent the big three and Detroit.

745
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,400
So he's going to make that happen.

746
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,760
And it's mainly for the pensions.

747
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,560
And I'm saying, what kind of fucking business are you running if you go belly up and the

748
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,160
pension money isn't there, then you've been stealing all along.

749
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,200
I'm not quite sure what the rules are on that, but that seems like the problem.

750
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:53,280
If a company fails and they have a pension scheme, it should not be bringing down the

751
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,280
pension scheme with it.

752
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,760
I'm sorry, I just don't understand how that works.

753
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,960
How can those guys do that?

754
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,080
That's the thing that I'd like to have investigated because that means that every single

755
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,560
business is in peril.

756
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,760
And if you as long as you have a lot of employees, you're always going to be too big

757
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,760
to fail.

758
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:18,520
Artists of whether you make crap or something that people want or not.

759
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:26,880
What was I going to say, man, another article here, this is, this is not just something

760
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,320
I can read for you, you've got to kind of read through this and pay a little bit of attention

761
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,160
to it because I believe that this is where now you can kind of see, and this is what I love

762
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,720
about living kind of in the middle of Gitmo Nation.

763
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,400
So you've got a lot of Western Europe off to the West, obviously, got the United States on

764
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,400
the East.

765
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,400
In the middle of these time zones, you can read the news.

766
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,640
It's all pretty much the same.

767
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,600
All the same things are happening, not in the same order necessarily.

768
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,560
But it's all mirroring the policies across the oceans.

769
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:04,920
And it looks like the United Kingdom is really going to bake in a lot of this carbon tax

770
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:11,600
stuff into their new laws that are set to come out very, very quickly.

771
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:20,320
And it's all based on climate change and carbon credits and how we're going to be paying

772
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,240
for it every single minute of the day.

773
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,080
So I do want you to take a look at that one.

774
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:32,560
It's titled British Green Laws, you'll find it in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

775
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,040
I heard an interview with Lindsay Williams on Friday.

776
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,440
It was posted on the drop.

777
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,160
Drop.au slash daily source code.

778
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:47,400
Lindsay Williams, of course, is the chaplain who worked for an oil company in Alaska in the

779
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,880
70s and became part of the inner circle and still has contact with one of the, I would

780
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,280
have to say, one of the true owners of the globe.

781
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,840
And he's been a predictor of oil prices for the past couple of years.

782
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,520
And he's been so spot on when he said, first, hey, look, it's going to go up to

783
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,240
what he said, 200, it didn't quite make that.

784
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,960
I went to, but no, actually, I think he said 150 and then the, the Russians were calling

785
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:17,120
for 200, but it did go up to 147 and then he came out and he said, oh, it's going to go

786
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:17,640
back down.

787
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,920
It's going down to 50 because this is what these guys have told me.

788
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,960
And if you have a chance, listen to that interview, it's from the Alex Jones show.

789
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,760
I love listening to Alex Jones because he does have phenomenal guests on and it's just

790
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,000
great to hear it coming out of their own mouths.

791
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,640
So the whole point of this to drop it down to 50 dollars a barrel, which is pretty

792
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,600
much unsustainable to actually produce it today.

793
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,720
And I understand that it's about $40 to get it out of the ground and get it, you know,

794
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,760
get it transported.

795
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,160
If you're taking it out of the sea or any, you know, ocean bed, then it's closer to to 80.

796
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,520
So that's almost like a wash, like a non starter.

797
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:02,320
Apparently, the whole idea is for the true owners of the globe, the energy elite, which

798
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:07,520
of course, because of oil, we're reliant upon them for everything we do based on energy.

799
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,400
God, can we find a new source of energy that really works in his free and easy?

800
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,520
They're going to decimate the Middle East.

801
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,000
That means completely bankrupt them.

802
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:24,080
Because what's going to happen is they're going to need to cash in their, the reserve currency

803
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,400
to when, you know, when they're getting out of third, it's like a credit crunch for them, too.

804
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,200
You know, all of a sudden there's less oil wanted and the price has gone down to a third of

805
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,880
what it was. I mean, these guys were banking on that all across the Middle East.

806
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:46,160
And of course, the prediction is that huge oil fields will open up in Indonesia and in Alaska,

807
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,040
near Russia, which is near and we're Sarah Palin lives.

808
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:59,120
And this has been widely reported that oil has been found huge oil up in near the poll.

809
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,720
And of course, you know, now there's a question of who really owns it, the Russian.

810
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,560
This subs there right now, stake in our territory. It's pin reported everywhere.

811
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,520
So the Middle East left the dump there reserve currency, which happens to be dollars when they dump

812
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,280
that trillions of dollars overnight, the dollar will become worthless.

813
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,400
Because they're just going to need the money like everybody else. And if you don't understand this

814
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:29,040
reserve currency, do some research on it, please, there's lots of places to understand how

815
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:35,280
reserve banking, how that works, how something, how the dollar has become a reserve currency,

816
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:42,160
what a reserve currency means and how the central banks control this this currency through the

817
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:47,760
raising and lowering of interest rates. And don't think that people on television who act

818
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,840
like they know what's going on, don't think they actually understand it. Okay, they're probably

819
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:56,880
too embarrassed to say, you know, I really don't know how to how this is working. Don't think that

820
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:03,280
your government representatives that you elected actually understand it. Once you you read through it

821
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,560
and you get it and you can kind of remove the concept of of coins and just think of it as data

822
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:15,600
in a spreadsheet and how it's being manipulated and how the dollar, the dollars or the euros or

823
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:20,880
the pranks or the accroner or whatever you're holding your hand is just really a piece of paper

824
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:28,800
and doesn't represent any value of anything except a myth, a facade. Once you understand that,

825
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:34,080
then your eyes will open up to the peril that well, that is basically in front of us. I want to say

826
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:41,680
I mean, yeah, just get ready to get rid of a lot of the shit that you own and not to be

827
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:47,920
buying any new shit and be prepared to work. Okay, with your hands because we're going to see a

828
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,640
lot of people looking for work and the work that's going to be created now announced by by the new

829
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:00,640
administration is going to be infrastructure, which I think I predicted a couple months ago,

830
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,560
which means it'll be more printing of money because the government, they don't have any money,

831
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,400
this it's just all been spent. So either we have to go borrow more, which I think at this point is

832
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,880
becoming pretty unlikely. So just to print more, which means there will be inflation.

833
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,880
Go look at Sim Bobway. If you want to see the results of that as plenty, you see my my $100

834
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,880
billion in Bobway note up on my flicker site. That's not the third deal. They actually chopped off

835
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,920
all the zeros and it went back up into billions again. Inflation has just been going out of control.

836
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,440
But that'll be to rebuild and by the way, it's not that we don't need new bridges, new highways,

837
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,920
fix the infrastructure of our of the United States. But it's manual labor.

838
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,280
And it's, and those are the kind of jobs that are going to be out there. You know, there's plenty of

839
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:57,040
stuff. Go look at the great depression and go look at what happened and see if it could have been

840
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:03,760
avoided if the government hadn't consistently stuck its nose and trying to save industries and

841
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:14,160
banks. And it's it's a repeat. It's a repeat. Anyway, so what this all will probably

842
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:19,360
result in is another repeat. We'll probably be looking at another Cold War with Russia, who by the way,

843
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:25,040
have now pretty much taken back all of the oil companies from these oligarchs who had stolen it in

844
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:30,480
the first place. Well, on the second I've got the lady Patricia to talk to her in a second.

845
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:41,040
They've got oil and gas certainly equal to the energy that is in the ground in the Middle East.

846
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,600
So we're going to be dealing with them. This is why these fights are being picked and why

847
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:50,960
missiles are being aligned up on both sides of Poland. It's just more of the same game. It's a

848
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,760
big ass reality show with ugly people playing in the lead role. In most cases, at least.

849
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,960
Uh, I had some one other thing I was going to talk about today about, uh, about white spaces,

850
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:08,000
but I'm just going to leave that for what it is. We'll get to that tomorrow. Let me see what we're

851
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,280
doing on time here.

852
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,480
Under an hour. I don't take that.

853
00:53:38,000 --> 00:54:01,440
I really don't know what you mean.

854
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:09,200
It seems like salvation comes only in the dreams.

855
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,680
I feel my hands ready to be on the street.

856
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:19,600
There must world really be a sad, it seems.

857
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:56,080
Don't take it away from me, don't take it away from me, don't take it away from me,

858
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:06,000
don't take it away from me, don't take it away from me, I need someone to pull on to,

859
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,840
I need to hold on to, come down, tell away from me, I need someone to hold on,

860
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:21,280
feel your arms, feel your arms, feel your arms, feel your hands, feel your arms,

861
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:51,280
It's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all

862
00:55:51,280 --> 00:56:21,280
it, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, let's, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it's all set, it

863
00:56:51,280 --> 00:57:20,760
All right, nine inch nails, terrible light.

864
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:25,160
I hear that. I'm pretty excited about this video stuff I'm getting into.

865
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,760
It may just be tests.

866
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,840
It'll be doing for the next couple of weeks until I actually get into the into the new castle.

867
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,600
I think it's going to be pretty cool.

868
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,400
I got a great name too.

869
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,560
I'm exciting stuff.

870
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:46,440
All right, so whether why's it's pretty crappy today.

871
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,800
So I just got to run a couple of errands.

872
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,080
I got to go get my shirts.

873
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,880
I've been running the entire house for a days now.

874
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,080
Once again, Mucho, a Prishinado for the for the lady P on how she runs this place.

875
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,480
And I got, you know, like, movers coming in, taking stuff.

876
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,080
It's a huge mess.

877
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:05,640
So anyway, somewhere along the line, probably Wednesday will speak again until then.

878
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,520
Please exercise your freedom.

879
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:15,000
Let it be known that the central banks are the real problem at hand.

880
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,840
That is what we must abolish.

881
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,280
That's what we have to get rid of.

882
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,200
Start the conversation.

883
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,200
Use that freedom wisely while you still can't.

884
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,880
And whatever you do, live your life with passion.

885
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,200
Another fine, medium presentation.

886
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,400
Stick it in your ear.
