1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, happy, watch you do one.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Pearl, I'm listening to the brand new Pod Show Press audiobook from Bedtime Stories My Kids Love The Adventures Of The Men In The Can.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And these put all the adventures of the men in the can into a book.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And it's going to be published on Pod Show Press.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But don't worry, you can hear the first chapter of the book is a podcast.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We're going to find it.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Just go to bedtimestoriesmykidslove.podshow.com each week to listen to a brand new chapter of the book.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Wow, hey, happy, that's great news.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hey, aren't you supposed to introduce the show?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh yeah, big hair, big show, big time.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Love ya, but no homo, Delta's here at Charlie.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Seven, two, one.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
With 15 bags of squanders stuck in our pants.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Sugar!

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And 15 bags of toilet paper hanging from our cracks.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We don't need no stinkin' sugar.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I like a thing I'm right.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
For the future.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We're gonna hold on to his day.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He's very, very.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Sugar!

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hot summer, beating down.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Burnin' my feet just warming around.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Hot summer, making a sweat.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Gators never close, fuzzin' dark in the air.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I can dance, I can talk.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
All the things about me, you're the way I want.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I can dance, I can dance, I can sing.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm just standing here, set up everything.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Set up, set up, you're telling me, you're driving love.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I've been sniffed at me.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Time to run, you're telling me, telling me, telling me.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We do sit on the beach.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But don't talk to me, but she's at the beach.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We do sit on the beach.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I can dance, I can talk.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
All the things about me, you're the way I want.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I can dance, I can talk.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
All the things about me, you're the way I want.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I can dance, I can sing.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm just standing here, set up everything.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Set up, set up everything.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're telling me, you're driving love.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I've been sniffed at me.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Time to run, you're telling me, telling me, telling me.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We do sit on the beach.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We do sit on the beach.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We do sit on the beach.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can sing, I can sing.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can dance, I can talk.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
All the things about me, you're the way I want.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All the things about me, you're the way I want.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm just standing here, set up everything.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Set up, set up everything.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're telling me, you're driving love.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I've been sniffed at me.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Time to run, you're telling me, telling me, telling me.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We do sit on the beach.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We do sit on the beach.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We do sit on the beach.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We do sit on the beach.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're driving love.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
All the things about me, you're the way I want.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
All the things about me, you're the way I want.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,500
Got to tell ya. I built up quite a rapport with DJ Schmolley over the past couple of weeks.

66
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,600
Of course, played his match me on Medeo, so on the Fubar Friday.

67
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,100
And start checking out some more of this stuff. Awesome. I love this.

68
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,200
I can't drop upside down.

69
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,100
DJ Schmolley kicking off episode number 721 of the daily source code.

70
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,400
It is Monday, February 11th, 2008.

71
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,300
Another beautiful day outside of the United Kingdom.

72
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,700
Blue skies, no clouds, almost no wind.

73
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,500
Again, what the hell am I doing here instead of flying around?

74
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,000
That's a very good question.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,500
You know, actually I was very excited over the weekend.

76
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Finally, everything came together on this quest that I've been on for.

77
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,500
I got to say at least four and a half years probably or four.

78
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, about four years.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,500
I've literally been trying to find the all in one, one box solution for recording

80
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,500
everything I need to on one computer.

81
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,500
And all I really want is I want to be able to just put a microphone in,

82
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,500
put headphones on and everything else should just work, all the routing, all the,

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,500
you know, all this external gear that I normally carry around.

84
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Of course, the biggest problem was latency.

85
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,500
The minute you start processing your voice with electronic or software,

86
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,500
essentially, it then it builds in an automatic delay.

87
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,500
And this delay can make you talk funny.

88
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
So it looks like a combination of a couple things.

89
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Well, the guys over at Apple, I got to give them big ass props.

90
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
No, let me back up.

91
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
I have tried everything to do this.

92
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
I've tried it with previous power books.

93
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
I've tried it with Windows machines.

94
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,500
I've tried it with external recording devices and audio hijack pro.

95
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,500
And of course, all of that eventually led when we started off in like 2004 before we

96
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
would encounter numbers on the show.

97
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,500
That eventually led to the collaboration with Mike for state that turned into cast

98
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
plaster on Windows.

99
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
That's the whole reason I moved to the Windows platform.

100
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,500
It looks like the guys in Cupertino have really gotten together with with the latest OS.

101
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:40,500
And with the, I guess the dual core horsepower that these new MacBooks have.

102
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Because finally everything is there.

103
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,500
This whole concept of this, I guess it's the core audio team at Mac who put all this together.

104
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,500
The concept of aggregate devices being able to route through virtual devices.

105
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Add onto that the smartness of the guys over at Ableton who make Ableton live.

106
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Who have essentially concentrated 100% on speed and processing and ease of use.

107
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,500
And not a lot on the interface to very flat interface.

108
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,500
No spiffy knobs, no high end renderings of something.

109
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,500
It looks like a 24 track mixer or anything like that.

110
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Lots of flexibility to build up the interface the way you want it.

111
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Why the fuck is the dog barking while I'm talking?

112
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,500
It rotates me.

113
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Oh, I know why it's the window washer guys here.

114
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
He's warning us.

115
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,500
He's not actually barking.

116
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,500
So everything now works inside the Mac.

117
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
I can route to Skype and back again.

118
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
External applications have to be fair.

119
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,500
I'm also using another program called SoundBiteBiteSpelt as BYTE as in a computer bite.

120
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Which essentially lets me load up a whole bunch of anything.

121
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Well, anything I guess, you know, MP3s, wave, AFFs, GS3 files that come off of cell phones.

122
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,500
You can just drop it into essentially it looks like a cartridge rack.

123
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
You can fire stuff up and you can pause it.

124
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
And that's it's a good program.

125
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
It's not quite the way I'd like it.

126
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
But it's certainly fulfills the main need.

127
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,500
And now I've hooked up the Yamaha workstation.

128
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,500
The Alpha Whiskey's 16 golf older listeners remember that one.

129
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
And I'm using it basically as a MIDI controller.

130
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,500
So now when I move the microphone fader up and down like that,

131
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:30,500
I actually, I'm not actually controlling the output of the microphone into the computer.

132
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
I'm controlling the live software.

133
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,500
And I actually see the faders move on the screen,

134
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,500
or at least the indicators that are indicating the fader.

135
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,500
So anyway, now I've found, I forget the name of it.

136
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,500
I found this beautiful little portable battery operated MIDI driven.

137
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,500
And by the way, is MIDI undervalued or what?

138
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,500
This MIDI driven six port fader bay.

139
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
So I can take that on the road.

140
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,500
And then all I basically need is that as an external device,

141
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,500
very lightweight, not a whole another computer to carry around.

142
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
My microphone, my headphones, and I'm done.

143
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,500
And it's expandable so I can add on another one of those panels

144
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,500
where I can just, I can map button so I could fire up songs

145
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,500
and little bits and openings and jingles, et cetera.

146
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
It's really come together.

147
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
So far, in fact, now I'm ready.

148
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,500
I think I'm ready, or just about after this kind of stabilizes.

149
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
I'm sure that it all works.

150
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,500
I'm going to go for one of these live situations.

151
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,500
I think that there's some good services out there

152
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,500
that offer you a phone bridge and you can mute and unmute people

153
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
and it's a chat room.

154
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
And I really wanted to give it a try.

155
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Especially after hearing this comment from J-Mac over at hood hype.

156
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,500
I'm just wanted to check in and drop you a message.

157
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:47,500
You know, we did our first live show through Eustream.

158
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,500
We just did audio only in over the year.

159
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,500
And I tell you what, and there's something to be said about doing a live chat

160
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,500
and inviting people to call in live when you're interviewing somebody

161
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
right there.

162
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,500
And when you're spending music and you get live comments

163
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
of what people think, based on the people coming out

164
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,500
and dropping off, you can see real time what people like and dislike.

165
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Because a lot of people are really too lazy to post a message on the blog

166
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,500
or to email, or you can call for that matter when you give them a free phone number.

167
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Yeah, this is essentially the real difference between podcasting and live radio.

168
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,500
It's about the time driven nature of it.

169
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
When you have to tune in, there's certain time to get something

170
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,500
and I think J-Mac is going to talk about how that happens when you miss stuff.

171
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:44,500
You know, having people respond in real time, but also a finite starting and ending point.

172
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,500
You know, like this morning, it's like I spent at least an hour

173
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,500
ticking around after I got my perfect setup.

174
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
It actually wouldn't start up.

175
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
And I was so ready to pontificate too.

176
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,500
But this of course was because my Mac needed it's weekly reboot.

177
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Very different from Windows, where it's a couple times a day

178
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,500
because something with the MIDI court server was all messed up.

179
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,500
And by the way, I still got to give props to the core audio team

180
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
because I've been messing with this thing for at least a week

181
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,500
and amaze that I hadn't had to reboot before then.

182
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Anyway, let's check in with J-Mac again.

183
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Let's see what he has on his experiences with doing who'd hype live.

184
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
Anyway, so which brings me to my next question.

185
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,500
I listen to Howard Stern religiously every single damn day during the week.

186
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,500
I get 30 minutes to listen to the show on serious satellite.

187
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Luckily for me, they looped the show all day.

188
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
If I'm lucky, I won't catch it in the same segment.

189
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,500
I was listening to it on and I get 230 minute pieces of the 4-5 hour show.

190
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,500
My problem is, you know, I want to hear the whole damn thing.

191
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
I just don't have the ability to.

192
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Well, you know, that's interesting because I think if you listen to Howard Stern,

193
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
sometimes he goes on very long rants.

194
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,500
And that will carry out a thread throughout those three or four hours.

195
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,500
But very often they regurgitate or repeat stuff.

196
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Certainly every other morning show that I know over the United States does this

197
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
because the audience flips over every 15 minutes.

198
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,500
And honestly, I don't think it's necessary.

199
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:14,500
And you don't have to, I think you can get everything out in under an hour.

200
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
But of course, it's a little different because it's a live situation.

201
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
They're just passing the time.

202
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
They've got to do something.

203
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
So it is very interesting.

204
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Sorry about that.

205
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
And I'm not quite sure.

206
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Well, I got to think about it actually.

207
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,500
I got to think about if the Howard Stern show has changed dramatically

208
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
since they're on serious or not.

209
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,500
I'm sure that they were thinking a lot more about repeating certain items

210
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
and certain news bits when they were still on free to air broadcast.

211
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,500
So if I can put it on my iPod, you know,

212
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,500
via podcasts, subscription to iTunes or whatever,

213
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
that would be optimal.

214
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,500
But I'm sure there's advertising issues with that.

215
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Copyright issues with that.

216
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Yeah, obviously they can't be tracked and all that shit.

217
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,500
So my thing is,

218
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
it's all about the music.

219
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,500
That's the only reason why you can't,

220
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
and how much music do they play?

221
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,500
The Howard Stern show doesn't play very much music.

222
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
That's just the control issue then.

223
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
I think it's just because they don't want their shit out on the internet.

224
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
And it's probably a part of the contracts

225
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,500
so that it remains exclusive to serious.

226
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
Did you see the price?

227
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,500
You know, why can't we create something

228
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,500
that there's a happy medium between all of it?

229
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
You know,

230
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,500
I guess satellite radio would have to be free

231
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:37,500
in order for podcasting to be a legitimate medium

232
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
married with the satellite radio

233
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,500
because it doesn't work if the podcast is out there for free.

234
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Yeah, there's an interesting article

235
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
on the financial times I read over the weekend about.

236
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
There's some shifts going on here

237
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
when it comes to infrastructure

238
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,500
because you mentioned serious satellite would have to be for free.

239
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Well, unfortunately,

240
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,500
they don't really know how to sell advertising on serious.

241
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
The sponsorships, yes,

242
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
but real advertising spot advertising,

243
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
no, because they don't,

244
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,500
I don't think they qualify for the arbitron ratings.

245
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
That's what you need.

246
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
You have to appear in the ratings book

247
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,500
which makes it very, very complicated.

248
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
And on top of that,

249
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,500
keeping two satellites in orbit continuously is an extremely expensive business.

250
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,500
Same thing going on here with digital audio broadcast,

251
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
better known as DAB,

252
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,500
where this company has invested very heavily

253
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,500
in all this architecture and infrastructure

254
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
so that they can actually deliver

255
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
multi channels of digital pristine clear quality audio.

256
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
But the bottom line is

257
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,500
only 1% of all people have digital audio broadcast capabilities

258
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
in their car.

259
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
So unless the government says,

260
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
we're going to stop all regular FM

261
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,500
and AM broadcast which they will never do.

262
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,500
That's just not going to be the same type of

263
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,500
silo-driven pipe business model

264
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,500
that people have to have to listen to

265
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,500
one particular type of architecture in order to

266
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
be able to listen to it all.

267
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Now there's just so much choice.

268
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,500
So when you look at the percentage of people who have an iPod

269
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,500
or other MP3 device,

270
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
I think it's pretty clear where the future

271
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
is going to be.

272
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
But it's open.

273
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,500
There's no restrictions.

274
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,500
There's no one who has the lock on the frequencies.

275
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Or people are pirating.

276
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
They'll show out there for free.

277
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Damn it.

278
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
There's got to be a way to do this.

279
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
So I don't know, man.

280
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,500
I think that's the battle with serious satellite

281
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,500
trying to get them to accept a free medium.

282
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Now it's about money.

283
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
If somebody's going to be paying money,

284
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
why would they fucking pay if they're

285
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
can download it on the internet?

286
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
But the fact is that.

287
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Exactly.

288
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,500
So anyway, my question is,

289
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
or my idea is,

290
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
we need to come up with something that

291
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
allows people to do it all.

292
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Complete 100% freedom.

293
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Podcasting offers that,

294
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,500
but man, if the live feed

295
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
that just has so many cool

296
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,500
extra things to it, man,

297
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
I love it.

298
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
I wish we could do it all, man.

299
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
I really do.

300
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
What are your thoughts on it?

301
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
I would really like to hear it.

302
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
I know it's all about sucked a man,

303
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
fuck bro.

304
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Podcast media.

305
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
It's all about violence.

306
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Sure.

307
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
I was bringing a whole hell of a lot

308
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
to a show.

309
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
So we'll look at what you're doing.

310
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
I'll be curious to hear your thoughts.

311
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Thank you.

312
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Okay.

313
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
Jay Mag, look at what you're doing, man.

314
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
You're doing essentially.

315
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Although it's not quite streaming live

316
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,500
onto portable devices,

317
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
but it will.

318
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
I mean, it can only take five or ten years

319
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
and we'll be there and then the internet

320
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
will be ubiquitous.

321
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
You'll be able to pick it up

322
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
on almost any portable device.

323
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
And then you can do a live show.

324
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
The question is,

325
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
what is the audience really want at that point?

326
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
It seems that, you know,

327
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,500
live broadcast is still works on radio.

328
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
How many listeners did you have?

329
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
That's what I'd like to know.

330
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
So I think it can work both ways.

331
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
One is the way I do it,

332
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
which is essentially you call in

333
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
with your phone comments.

334
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
And we have a quasi interaction,

335
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
which of course is intellectually

336
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
not quite very stimulating for either party,

337
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
but I think it does work

338
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
and doing it for a while.

339
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
And then, of course,

340
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
the other way is to do a live show

341
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
that people who can participate

342
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
and I think you'll find that a

343
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
group will be able to tune in

344
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
and if you have some,

345
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
you know,

346
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
if you can set up a schedule for yourself,

347
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
we can do it at the same time every day.

348
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Of course, for me,

349
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,500
that's a double whammy,

350
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
because you know,

351
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
I'd love to do it in the morning

352
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
or in the afternoon,

353
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
or the evening,

354
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
and one particular time zone

355
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
is going to be different

356
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
all over the world.

357
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
And the Charlie listeners,

358
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
just looking at that survey,

359
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
man,

360
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
we're from all over the place.

361
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Anyway,

362
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
to be continued,

363
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
and right into something

364
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
I've been saving up a whole bunch of comments

365
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
about this is the

366
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
metered bandwidth trial

367
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
in Beaumont, Texas,

368
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
time Warner is doing.

369
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
And of course,

370
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
lots of people have opinions on it,

371
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,500
and let's listen to a couple of them.

372
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Hey,

373
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
what's going on?

374
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Hey, I'm your Beaumont.

375
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,500
This is David,

376
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
your friend,

377
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
and Bobbi, Texas.

378
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Hey, David,

379
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
call you every once in a while.

380
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
You know,

381
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
the big thing is that we got

382
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
compounds now for eyelids,

383
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
and time Warner was through.

384
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
I didn't know they were still in the time

385
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
and the Beaumont market.

386
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Yeah, see,

387
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
I've been looking for someone who lives in Beaumont, Texas,

388
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
so I can actually find out

389
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
what the metered trial is all about,

390
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
and how they're thinking of charging,

391
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
and is there a limit you get,

392
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
and then you pay over,

393
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
I mean,

394
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
all the questions that are just completely unanswered.

395
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
That's interesting news to hear.

396
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
It's metered stuff,

397
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
garbage.

398
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
I just read a pay for the highway,

399
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
and you know,

400
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
just get where I need to go.

401
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Not a mean.

402
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Uh-huh.

403
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
In fact,

404
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
we talked about that,

405
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,500
that very topic about paying more on the highway,

406
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
if you have a bigger rig,

407
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
if you're using up more of the road,

408
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
I eat,

409
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
if you're using up more bandwidth

410
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
or the only guy who can answer that

411
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
is our very own trucker time.

412
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,500
You know, Adam,

413
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Tom Wiles here,

414
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
aka Trucker Tom,

415
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,500
trucks do indeed pay a lot more

416
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,500
to use the roads than cars or motorcycles.

417
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Now, I'm a company driver.

418
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,500
I'm making wages just to drive a company truck,

419
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
so I'm not paying out of my pocket,

420
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
but I do know that the average truck,

421
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
and this is kind of an estimate,

422
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,500
is paying probably 15 to 20,000 dollars

423
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
a year.

424
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Rolling drive.

425
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Various fuel taxes,

426
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
road use taxes,

427
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
registration fees,

428
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,500
so on and so forth.

429
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
It's very expensive to operate truck.

430
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
One of the problems I see is that

431
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
it's inconsistent from state to state.

432
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
California, for example,

433
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
if you own a car in California,

434
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
it's going to be more expensive

435
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
than if you own a car in Arkansas

436
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
for where I live, for example.

437
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
You know,

438
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
if they could make it consistent

439
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
for the immediate bandwidth,

440
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
if they could make it consistent

441
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
all across the country,

442
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
it might be a good system,

443
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
but what I'm afraid of is you

444
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,500
end up with different prices for different regions.

445
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Something's going to have to be done.

446
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,500
It's going to be interesting to see

447
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
what the results are of the

448
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
experiment that they're conducting in Beaumont.

449
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,500
You can find my podcast at Trucker Tom podcast.com.

450
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,500
You can find my HD video podcast at Trucker Tom HD.com.

451
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,500
I'm talking also find my video podcast

452
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,500
as of February 1st on Tivo.

453
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,500
You can find me on the Tivo Guide.

454
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,500
You can check that out at TivoCast. podshow.com.

455
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
All right Tom. Yo.

456
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
You love you, me and it.

457
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Sorry about the crackling there.

458
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
I've said my latency filter.

459
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
But I can't change it while I'm recording.

460
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
So if you hear a crackle once in a while,

461
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
do not be alarmed.

462
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
It's not the wire on your earbud.

463
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,500
So we heard last week from Belgium listener

464
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
who talked about his bandwidth constantly in the cost

465
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
and his situation.

466
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,500
Of course, I would venture to say that the infrastructure in Europe

467
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,500
and in the east and the far east is a lot better in the United States.

468
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Of course, this is only US-centric conversation.

469
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,500
I am here during a long time listener since Episode 1.

470
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
I'm calling with some info about the meter bandwidth

471
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
discussion you were talking about.

472
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Here in Holland, I pay 20 euros each month for a full limited data pack.

473
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,500
And usually I'm around about 60 to 60 gigs a month.

474
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Wow.

475
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
20 euros for unlimited bandwidth.

476
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Are you sure there's not little asterix there?

477
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
That says that there is a limit.

478
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Check on your bill or your contract

479
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
and get back to me, man.

480
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Because that sounds almost too good to be true.

481
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
And you've got 20 megabits down one megabit up.

482
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Oh, I've got wood for your situation.

483
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,500
It's 20 down and one up.

484
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,500
So it's a bit cheaper than the Belgian guys.

485
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,500
A little democratic for me.

486
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,500
On the bus driver, a city bus driver here in Holland.

487
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,500
I'm 30 years wife two kids.

488
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Yeah, just a normal guy.

489
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:34,500
I'm also trying to start my podcast called talking about being a bus driver.

490
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Yeah.

491
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
I'm searching for info.

492
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
If you can help me do this.

493
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
And yeah.

494
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Fuller rep deal.

495
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
I love you no homo.

496
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
I wish you a good day.

497
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
Hi, boy.

498
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
Thank you.

499
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
Yeah, let me know about your contract.

500
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,500
If it's really true that there's no, no cap on what you can use on a monthly basis.

501
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Usually there's a little, a little fine print there that you got to take a look at.

502
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
But, you know, it's Europe.

503
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Wouldn't surprise me.

504
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Interesting.

505
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
The idea of a bus driver doing a podcast.

506
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,500
That what I would do is I would rig my, my, my set up there.

507
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,500
And yeah, I'm sure you have lots of interesting conversations with people.

508
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
That's what I would be doing.

509
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
I'd be recording that.

510
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,500
But then again, I'm not a bus driver.

511
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Not everyone's happy with this.

512
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,500
All right.

513
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
I'm curious.

514
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Officially lost your freaking mind.

515
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
About meter bandwidth.

516
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
Come on.

517
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
There's a big, big hole in your theory.

518
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
And the big hole is this.

519
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,500
The cell phone industry, which you keep using as an example.

520
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Lowering rates and how it's much cheaper now.

521
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Is suffering from competition.

522
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,500
There are four or five, maybe even seven major carriers of cell phones in the United States.

523
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,500
Yeah, but my friend, it didn't start out that way.

524
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Now, did it?

525
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,500
It took quite a while for there to be some real competition in cell phones.

526
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
There were competing systems today.

527
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,500
There is still competing systems.

528
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,500
Well, you can't use one phone on another network.

529
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,500
And there's all kinds of downsides and competitive measures that it just took time.

530
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,500
You know, it takes time.

531
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:17,500
And I believe that anyone should at least have a DSL option, a cable mode of option.

532
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,500
And then why not even a dedicated line?

533
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:26,500
You know, like a local unbundled local loop.

534
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,500
It does take some effort, you know, depending on where you are.

535
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Companies aren't going to set up unless it's going to pay off.

536
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,500
So you've got to create, you know, groups of people that say, hey, we're willing to look at an alternative.

537
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
That's how it works.

538
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
Competition doesn't just show up.

539
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
You've kind of got to work for it.

540
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
That competition drives down prices.

541
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,500
The problem is even in major metropolitan areas like where I live in Seattle.

542
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,500
I still cannot get anything but contest for my provider.

543
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
They will never drop my rate.

544
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,500
So you can't get a DSL connection through the phone line.

545
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,500
I had to find that hard to believe simply because they don't have any competition.

546
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,500
And as long as the, you know, infrastructure built on a wired system.

547
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,500
There's no incentive for competition because the output in order to run more wire is so expensive.

548
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,500
That unless you're 18T on East Coast and already have an infrastructure there, which they don't have here.

549
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
And there's no competition.

550
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
There's no reason for competition.

551
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,500
There's no incentive for someone to stream a new wire because it would be too expensive.

552
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,500
So therefore, meter bandwidth is only going to host people like me who have no other options.

553
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
I can't get DSL.

554
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,500
I guess I could get a cable or a satellite modem.

555
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,500
I had a choice in that, but it's not really competition.

556
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Competition is what's going to drive down cost.

557
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
That's what drove down cost to the philanthropy.

558
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Love you.

559
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
I mean it.

560
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Great hair.

561
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Hope you win.

562
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
Love you.

563
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,500
No home.

564
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Emma.

565
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,500
You know what?

566
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
It's very interesting.

567
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
You can't get DSL.

568
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,500
It seems to me like someone technically it should be possible.

569
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,500
There may not be another offering there, but technically it should be possible.

570
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,500
And I think that's where you have to go.

571
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,500
So in the meantime, I'm still trying to find someone who lives in Beaumont, Texas, to find out what's going on.

572
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:13,500
So if you remember, consider that maybe the reason why you're not hearing from anyone in Beaumont is because

573
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:18,500
the internet service is so expensive that they can't afford to download podcasts.

574
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,500
No, I hadn't considered it, but it's a good point.

575
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,500
I had a list of Paul and Littleton Colorado.

576
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,500
A long time listener called in a couple of times, I think.

577
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
I can remember anyways.

578
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,500
But anyways, I was driving home listening.

579
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,500
Episode 719.

580
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,500
We started talking about the bandwidth issues.

581
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,500
It was a limited or meter bandwidth.

582
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
And I had a question.

583
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:54,500
I believe that color from Belgium was saying is like a year old per gig over on that meter.

584
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:02,500
When I started thinking, if they started doing like a dollar here, for every gig over the, a lot of,

585
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:09,500
most consumers will think that's pretty fair deals, not knowing that they're making in the moment 90 cents.

586
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,500
On the dollar of profit per gig that you go over.

587
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:20,500
So just wondering if you think that's fair, if, if, I don't know if any, if anything can be done about that,

588
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:27,500
that's just my thought that they'd probably price it right around the dollar on an overage charge.

589
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:38,500
But I also was thinking, have you tried or thought of contacting someone directly from a well time Warner about the pilot in Beaumont since no one

590
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,500
from Beaumont has called or contacted you.

591
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,500
You know, that's such a good point.

592
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:52,500
And honestly, I don't think there's a reporter out there that has taken the effort that has made the effort to actually call time Warner and ask exactly that.

593
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
I know I certainly haven't.

594
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,500
We do seem, you know, this is a culturally very interesting.

595
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:06,500
We seem very, very much at ease to copy paste news reports and then add our own opinion and yell and rant,

596
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:13,500
actually do the work that it probably should should be put into something to affect any kind of change or getting information.

597
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,500
We're just a bunch of lazy bastards.

598
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
Man, you're so right.

599
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Okay.

600
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Does anyone know if anyone has actually asked time Warner about this G would a novel question?

601
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:32,500
Just be kind of interested to see if maybe someone from their PR department will be even willing to talk about this on your show.

602
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
There's a couple of thoughts.

603
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,500
See if I can get this sign off to incorrect.

604
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Here you go.

605
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,500
31 Italian American losing hair.

606
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
Hope I win too.

607
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
And, uh, Guillermo Adam.

608
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,500
Yeah.

609
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
No, almost.

610
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,500
Guillermo.

611
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Thank you very much.

612
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
I appreciate a good point.

613
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
How stupid am I not even think of that?

614
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,500
I'm going to hunt around on Google News and see if anyone actually spoke to a time Warner representative.

615
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
All right.

616
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
I'm sick and tired of this.

617
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:09,500
Oh, you know, I've always heard that Carmen Tyler has such a beautiful voice that she could read the phone book and make it sound good.

618
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,500
So I think that makes me a karma haul like I'm not sure.

619
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:23,500
With anger at the thought that Adam Curry wanted naked pictures of this beautiful perfect angelic pure Carmen that we love listening to so much.

620
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
It just angers me.

621
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:31,500
I got thinking, you know, you're real gift to all of us via these little podcast isn't just a cute half hour or so sweet fun chatter.

622
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
No.

623
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,500
No, the real appeal of Carmen Tyler is the positive spirit that you have, Carmen.

624
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Even though you've never sent me the naked picture.

625
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Make pictures.

626
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
I assure you.

627
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,500
You have the fuck.

628
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Well, he keeps them to himself.

629
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
Because I know I would.

630
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
If I had naked pictures of Carmen.

631
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:56,500
That's K-R-M-Y-N-K-A-S-T dot pot show dot com.

632
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
Oh, indeed.

633
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,500
You know, I'm going out to LA.

634
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,500
I think in the next couple of weeks from maybe a day or two and I can't wait.

635
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,500
If I'm lucky, I can hook up with Carmen Tyler who's out there.

636
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,500
Sir, ladies from the pod safe music network, think you'll like it.

637
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
For it in love.

638
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Oh, I think she's sending me messages again.

639
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:27,500
In a day, she don't know what to do.

640
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,500
She's late.

641
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,500
How he just moved my throat.

642
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:43,500
She loved and then he went away.

643
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:52,500
For then now she don't know what to say.

644
00:30:52,500 --> 00:31:00,500
And don't go away.

645
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:08,500
And don't leave me stay.

646
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:15,500
I need you here beside me.

647
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:22,500
For then now to go away.

648
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:45,500
Night's my pass.

649
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:51,500
Without a word from here.

650
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:59,500
Walking down from this, the perfect scene.

651
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:06,500
This love was tainted from me.

652
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:16,500
For then now to go away.

653
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:24,500
For then now to go away.

654
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:32,500
She didn't stay.

655
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:42,500
And now you're here.

656
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:53,500
I wonder how she records that.

657
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,500
I wonder if it was recorded with the musicians in the room or she did this in her.

658
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:05,500
I have this visual of her creating this in her apartment on like garage band.

659
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:10,500
It says it's a demo, but damn it's straight up for me, man.

660
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Carmen Tyler for bitten love from the pod safe music network.

661
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
And of course, you will find a link to that.

662
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,500
And everything else discussed in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

663
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,500
Okay, Adam.

664
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:26,500
In the Jewish religion, there are two crimes that are considered unforgivable.

665
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,500
Murder and adultery because they can never be taken back.

666
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:38,500
I think the Carpander's mashup that you played in daily source code number 720.

667
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
Could qualify as a third.

668
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Dude, that thing was fucking awful.

669
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,500
Okay, just plain fucking awful.

670
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:52,500
That thing, it's a musical abortion that needs to be a code hanger before you can play it again.

671
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,500
Now, I understand that some guy called in and he wanted to hear yesterday once more by the Carpander's,

672
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,500
which in itself is about as lame as Stephen Hawking on a stairmaster.

673
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,500
But you, you proceed to play this thing.

674
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Now, I love the mashups on mashup.com.

675
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,500
I love the mashups you play. They're very clever. They're cool.

676
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:20,500
They kind of, they tickle various spots in my cerebral cortex that I find to be satisfying.

677
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,500
But this Carpander's mashup, you know what it's like?

678
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,500
It's like getting a blowjob from somebody's grandma.

679
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,500
I mean, it may feel good for like the first one or two seconds,

680
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:35,500
but then after that you're filled with more loathing than ten years of therapy can cure.

681
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,500
This, of course, is hypothetical. I've never been blown by anybody's grandma,

682
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,500
but I'd like to think I keep an open mind.

683
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,500
Anyway, please, just, Adam, repeat after me.

684
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Okay, I hear you.

685
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Please say this.

686
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,500
Okay.

687
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,500
I will never play the Carpander's mashup again.

688
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,500
I will never play the Carpander's mashup again.

689
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
I promise.

690
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,500
Oh, man, I got like 15 minutes and we got a sales conference call,

691
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
so I got to hurry to long today.

692
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:08,500
Hey, good response from the Brits over here about the Snoop Dogg Nation better known

693
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,500
as the British Surveillance State.

694
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,500
Although on the, when it comes to close circuit TV cameras,

695
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,500
this is very interesting when I'm getting back.

696
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,500
So, you know, this, this country, for those of you just listening into this thread

697
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,500
for the first time, is filled with wire taps and over four million cameras.

698
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,500
If the most watched nation in the world barn on everybody knows it,

699
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,500
Stephen East meets, says Adam,

700
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,500
generally speaking, I'm with you on your argument for the most part.

701
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,500
I'm concerned about the amount of bugging and lack of accountability there appears to be,

702
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,500
but I'm not quite with you regarding public CCTVs.

703
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,500
I was a magistrate, which is, is that a judge?

704
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,500
I think it's a, well, we'll find out.

705
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,500
I'm magistrate for many years, which encompassed both pre and post widespread CCTV use,

706
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,500
while I consider that there ought to be more regulation of CCTV.

707
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,500
I only ever found them very helpful form of evidence in a magistrate's court.

708
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,500
And this is exactly what my wife says.

709
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,500
You know, she says, hey, this is really good because, you know,

710
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,500
bad people will are on the watch out because they know that they can be identified by cameras.

711
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
And yes, that is a benefit.

712
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,500
The question is, it's, you know, it's not the cameras.

713
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
It's who's operating them.

714
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
And what powers are they given?

715
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
And what can they watch you do?

716
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,500
And it's, it's never ending discussion.

717
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,500
This is why in the United States, it's such a big deal that this is being,

718
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
being done.

719
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,500
This is the whole, the hell is the name of that act, the Fina or whatever.

720
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,500
You know, it's, it's nuts.

721
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,500
Because, yeah, today they're catching bad guys tomorrow.

722
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Well, actually, today they're also catching you speeding by three miles an hour.

723
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,500
Yeah, now the CCTV cameras are starting to talk back to you,

724
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,500
telling you, hey, calm down over there.

725
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,500
I mean, this is big brother, no matter how you, how you look at it.

726
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
So, yes, well, sometimes it may be handy.

727
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
I just don't buy the argument.

728
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
If you have nothing to hide, what are you afraid of?

729
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
I like the argument.

730
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,500
I'm doing nothing wrong.

731
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Why do you have to be looking at me?

732
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
I don't know.

733
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,500
We've told you.

734
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,500
We're probably going to be drunk this evening.

735
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
I'm sorry.

736
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,500
Yes.

737
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
I am just walking past the practice.

738
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
It's a, I like getting it in recognition of it.

739
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
You need contribution to British cinema.

740
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:32,500
I'm on Monmouth Street, WC2 in London's West End.

741
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Just having a little looking to 719, I think.

742
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,500
Talk about the CCTV or closed circuit television.

743
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,500
You know, this shit really does piss me off, but it is unfortunately necessary

744
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,500
when you have this many people squeezing to such a small space.

745
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,500
All absolutely stuck and jacked to the eyeballs on booze.

746
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,500
They tend to fight in the streets.

747
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,500
And it's just, it's not common to these galley to run around.

748
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:10,500
You know, Charles, and by the way, I love it when you're drunk.

749
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:16,500
I think we should be looking at the cause of all the people boozed up to their eyeballs running around

750
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,500
drunk in the streets.

751
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,500
Why is that happening?

752
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,500
This doesn't happen in every single city.

753
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,500
It doesn't happen in New York.

754
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
It doesn't happen in Amsterdam.

755
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
It doesn't happen in San Francisco.

756
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:33,500
This is consistently happening in London specifically, but I believe in every city around the UK.

757
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:41,500
Maybe we should be looking at the reason behind that and why that is happening instead of just trying to put a bandaid on it

758
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,500
by stopping drunk people from running around.

759
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
Shouldn't we look at the root of the cause?

760
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,500
Unfortunately, it is a bit of a necessary evil.

761
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,500
But I have to say, when those cameras started talking,

762
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
we're right here.

763
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
That was that it's spooky.

764
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,500
I mean, if anyone is interested in a red film moment,

765
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:07,500
they really want to get themselves a copy of brave new world by all this luxury or even better.

766
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,500
The word that I think you really should have been looking for was all well,

767
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,500
and you should read the George Orwell book 1984.

768
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Yeah, good point.

769
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Go reread that.

770
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,500
Go reread it.

771
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,500
And then go look at that Tom Cruise movie.

772
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,500
What was it?

773
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
I can't remember the name of it.

774
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Something, something report.

775
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,500
You know, basically where they know you're going to commit a crime before you actually commit it,

776
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
and then they arrest you.

777
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Okay, that may be a bit far fetched.

778
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,500
But go reread it.

779
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,500
Go reread 1984.

780
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,500
Go to the library.

781
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Go to Amazon.

782
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,500
I'll put a link on Amazon on the show notes.

783
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,500
I'll put a link to the Amazon store so you can buy it.

784
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Purchase it, reread it.

785
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
You'll see where the dangers are.

786
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
This is not new.

787
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,500
Okay, so I mean, the book you've been in the station to appear to use 1984 as a manual,

788
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,500
to keep you at all in a state of constant fear.

789
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,500
The very, very beautiful book, but really excellent reading.

790
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,500
I am myself having read them all in fact a bit of a blue book.

791
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,500
Although, yeah, you know what, this, the ID cards.

792
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Don't get me started on that piece.

793
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
I'm snatched the chip inside my password.

794
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,500
Because I don't want to story all that shit about me.

795
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,500
So just have a number.

796
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,500
That's why I'm not actually on me.

797
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Now.

798
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
Anyway.

799
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,500
Bye.

800
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,500
All right, Charles.

801
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,500
Thank you.

802
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,500
Richard and Clay Gates as a flash mob to protest our service surveillance society.

803
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Which is what I suggested.

804
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,500
He said, when you've been the victim of a knife point mugging and seen the bastard convicted

805
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,500
on the strength of CCTV evidence, you might want to think again.

806
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,500
Ah, we really need some more red pills here, my friends.

807
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,500
Yes, that is a great benefit.

808
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,500
But maybe we go after stopping people before they mug you.

809
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
There's reasons behind that, too.

810
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,500
This is just a bandaid on top, which is trying to make you feel good while the same

811
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
time you're being frightened to death.

812
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,500
So you think that this is the right remedy.

813
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Can't you see that?

814
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,500
Some of you luckily can.

815
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Hey, Adam, I just want to say thanks very much for your show 720.

816
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Brilliant.

817
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Do you actually hit the nail well and truly on the head about the totalitarian state

818
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,500
that the UK has now become based on fear?

819
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,500
I reckon based on fear after seven, after 9, 11 with Bush and Blair screwing

820
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,500
us all completely out of fear.

821
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
Keep your scared.

822
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
Keep us under control and we'll accept anything.

823
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,500
And we certainly have in the UK.

824
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,500
One thing I suggest, you do, if you haven't seen it, is see a video called taking

825
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,500
it by Chris Atkins.

826
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:40,500
It's a brilliant video and it really explains Michael Moore fashion exactly what's happened

827
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,500
to us under the guy's of the Labour government.

828
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Oh man, you've got to watch that.

829
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,500
I posted the first episode that's broken up in the ten parts on YouTube.

830
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,500
I posted that on Curry.com over the weekend as required homework for all British

831
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,500
daily source code listeners.

832
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,500
That is a fantastic piece of work.

833
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,500
In fact, I saw last night that it was nominated for a British film and television award

834
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:07,500
at the BAFTAs, a very boring show otherwise, but I was surprised and delighted to see that.

835
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:13,500
You've got to watch this thing because you'll see that protesting actually is kind of outlawed

836
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
in the United Kingdom.

837
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
It was surprising to me.

838
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,500
Certainly within one kilometer of parliament, you are not allowed to protest.

839
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
Want to protest somewhere else?

840
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500
You've got to go watch this documentary.

841
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,500
You'll be surprised if you're living in the United Kingdom.

842
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,500
It is your duty as a Brit to watch that.

843
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,500
I'm not kidding.

844
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,500
And what they've done for us, they have completely removed our right to protest.

845
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,500
And that's the reason that nobody sees any protest anymore.

846
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,500
Because you have to apply to protest.

847
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,500
And of course they'll say no.

848
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,500
And if you go ahead, they'll of course crush it.

849
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,500
So yes, I think that the Labour government have done a lot of wonderful things for us.

850
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,500
But I can't think of one at this moment in time.

851
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,500
So many things you talked about.

852
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
You're absolutely right on about their heroes.

853
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,500
We've got the wrong heroes.

854
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
Football is being paid to ridiculous amounts of money.

855
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
They could actually pay for a hospital wing.

856
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,500
I think that's outrageous.

857
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,500
Dude, you are now officially my UK Savand.

858
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,500
You've got to call in more often, man.

859
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
First of all, I love the fact that you recorded this.

860
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,500
It sounds awesome.

861
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,500
I don't know what you're recording on.

862
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,500
You've got to send in more comments.

863
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,500
The media is stuffed full of footballers, wives, and trashy.

864
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,500
We call those distractions.

865
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:27,500
One of the three necessary tools of the three necessary legs of the stool of fascism.

866
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,500
Yep.

867
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,500
Keep them distracted.

868
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,500
In consequential news, what's wrong with the independent news?

869
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,500
Now, through I think podcasting is such an important part of the world information service.

870
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,500
We should be telling people exactly what is going on.

871
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:47,500
And certainly things like, are you aware that British citizens can now be taken to America?

872
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,500
By bounty hunters.

873
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:54,500
If you have a look at times online, the US and there's now clearly stated in a UK court of law,

874
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:59,500
that it has the right to kick them out of British citizens, accused of a crime in the US.

875
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,500
Horrific things are going on.

876
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,500
Of course, the government haven't protested against that.

877
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,500
Education, well, you touch a sore point there.

878
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,500
My wife was a teacher, and certainly there's a lot of things going on in education.

879
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:16,500
What people don't realise is just that the teachers are completely crushed by the amount of paperwork.

880
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,500
And they meant lists and targets that have been put onto them.

881
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,500
Oh, it doesn't surprise me at all.

882
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,500
I've seen the complete apathy of teachers in the public schooling system here.

883
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,500
Complete apathy.

884
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:35,500
I totally agree 100% that the Department of Education has removed all of their power.

885
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,500
And they can't discipline.

886
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,500
And they just have to hit too many targets.

887
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,500
And there's tons of paperwork.

888
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,500
Oh, I buy that for sure.

889
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,500
That's taken from the American Department of Education Playable.

890
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
I once again buy the government.

891
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,500
They don't get extra time.

892
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,500
And they've also taken away all their rights as regards discipline children and so on.

893
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,500
And of course, nobody will take responsibility.

894
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,500
These days, nobody takes responsibility for anything.

895
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,500
It's always somebody else's fault.

896
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,500
And if that's the case, that means they can sue.

897
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,500
So it's not surprising that kids don't protest.

898
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,500
They haven't actually seen a protest.

899
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,500
And when you consider you've got, that's a great point, man.

900
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,500
They haven't actually seen a protest.

901
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,500
The only protest kids today in the UK of seniors.

902
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:17,500
When footballers walk off the field because the crowd is throwing too much shit into the pitch.

903
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:22,500
Three generations in this country now that have probably never worked in a family.

904
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,500
And they've lived off the state.

905
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
And then the state opens its doors to these Europeans.

906
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
They come in their cheap labor.

907
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,500
They're earning money.

908
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,500
They're sending them any back home and they're using our facilities.

909
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,500
Maybe that's why we're all drinking over here.

910
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,500
That sounds like a pretty good, nucleus core of issues.

911
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,500
And blocking up the hospital as they're currently doing at the moment with the Polish people, apparently,

912
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,500
filling it all in maternity wards.

913
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,500
It's a dreadful state of affairs.

914
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,500
I couldn't agree with you more.

915
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,500
I just want to thank you very much for flagging it up.

916
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,500
I think we should be protesting an awful lot more.

917
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,500
And the best protest I could think of is actually everybody by a t-shirt that says,

918
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:02,500
you work for us and then surrounding parliament on a busy day and stopping the traffic and just saying,

919
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,500
just a silent protest.

920
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Just to remind them exactly where they got their power from.

921
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,500
But they've certainly abused that power.

922
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,500
And you're absolutely right.

923
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,500
There are what 20 or 30 cameras for every person in the UK at the moment.

924
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,500
It's outrageous.

925
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,500
So that's me, Sonny.

926
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,500
Thanks very much.

927
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,500
Late 40s.

928
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,500
Good looking.

929
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,500
No.

930
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,500
No.

931
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,500
Still married.

932
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,500
King podcaster.

933
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,500
And that's Bob from the Idol Station.

934
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,500
Bye.

935
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,500
Bye.

936
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,500
Bye.

937
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,500
Bye.

938
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,500
Thank you, man.

939
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,500
I love you.

940
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,500
No, homo.

941
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,500
Send him more, dude.

942
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,500
This is a great idea.

943
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,500
You work for us.

944
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,500
So we need t-shirts and we need to coordinate.

945
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:46,500
I think multiple flashmob since it is illegal to protest within one mile of parliament.

946
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
But this wouldn't be a protest.

947
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:53,500
It would be a quick flash mob and all of a sudden we'd have hundreds of people appeared with these t-shirts.

948
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,500
And then within five minutes, boom, we all disperse before the cops can do anything.

949
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,500
How cool does that sound?

950
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,500
Bob, you want to coordinate?

951
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,500
You want to rock and roll, man?

952
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,500
You want to have some fun?

953
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,500
I'm certainly ready for it.

954
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:12,500
Steven Lowe says, Adam, I have had my N-810.

955
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,500
This is a Nokia internet tablet.

956
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,500
Since they were launched in the UK, I love it.

957
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,500
Found all sorts of cool apps.

958
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,500
But apart from the video center app,

959
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,500
I haven't found a decent podcasting out the downloads directly.

960
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,500
Any ideas?

961
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,500
Muller?

962
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,500
What is it?

963
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,500
Muller?

964
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,500
How much?

965
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,500
$4.47.

966
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,500
Wage slave, Birmingham, UK, White Mail.

967
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,500
Boston Air, Hope you Win, Kippertai.

968
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,500
Love you, and a Brotherly, Love, Hippie Way.

969
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,000
XXX.

970
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
You know what?

971
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I posted a link on Curry.com,

972
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,500
just this morning to the candy men's Weblog.

973
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,000
You should take a look at that because he shows Canola,

974
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
which I think you'll like a lot.

975
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Canola, I think version 2 is now odd.

976
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I haven't had time to load it myself,

977
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,500
but it's a very nice interface for big thumb type usage.

978
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,380
and uh... i know that uh... previous versions of uh...

979
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,420
of canola have done podcast and quite well see might want to have uh...

980
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,580
have a check of that a wait a minute

981
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,020

982
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,620

It's at a James Beatles Otis running

1031
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,340
She's got like 8 or 9 tracks up on the pot

1032
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,340
That music never

1033
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,340
I'm definitely gonna listen to some of the stuff she has

1034
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,340
That's cool, waste my breath

1035
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,340
Links in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

1036
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:22,340
Okay, I got this sales call which started four minutes ago

1037
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,340
So I've really gotta go

1038
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,340
I'll be back tomorrow

1039
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,340
We'll have lots more to talk about

1040
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,340
I love you, I mean it in the home

1041
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,340
Well, in some cases maybe

1042
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,340
Hey, live your life with passion and please enjoy your freedom

1043
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,340
What's left of it?

1044
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,340
Another pod show podcast
