1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Did you real what I said?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Are we clear?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is the deadly source code.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
For $16 million worth of airplanes trapped by us.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Telling this blood in the disco text.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll take what we've become.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Come on, let go.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I can't ask you to let me.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I want you all the stars, nobody.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't say so.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm on the sea, I like the stars.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Don't say so.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I know.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You're broken on the inside.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The city is flowing through you.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's what you've become.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
To believe this is nothing we're saving.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There's love in the disco text.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll take what we've done.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Come on, let go.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I can't ask you to let me.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I want you all the stars, nobody.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't say so.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm on the sea, I like the stars.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't say so.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm on the sea, I like the stars.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't say so.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm on the sea, I like the stars.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't say so.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can't ask you to let me.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I want you all the stars, nobody.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't say so.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm on the sea, I like the stars.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't say so.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm on the sea, I like the stars.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You know, I'm not sure if I get off the concert.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm not sure if I get off the concert.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm not sure if I get off the concert.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm not sure if I get off the concert.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm not sure if I get off the concert.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm not sure if I get off the concert.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm not sure if I get off the concert.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm not sure if I get off the concert.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm not sure if I get off the concert.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you're a great brand new week, it's going to be a busy one.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I've got meetings on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, maybe even Friday.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But they're not in the city.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
One of them is in Kent, one of them is Sussex.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So that's just about an hour's drive away from the manner.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So I may be able to squeak out some shows.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Certainly a football Friday is in the works.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And today we're going to focus on two things.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
My fellow Czechaheads.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We're going to focus on the real reason behind the high price of crude oil.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And what we can do in the meantime to alleviate our high energy prices.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
At least for our automobiles and other internal combustion engine powered vehicles.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And I'm going to need your help because I haven't been able to corroborate everything.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But these two stories, I'm very excited about both because I just like the some logical reasoning behind it.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And particularly on the short-term interim solution to paying less for driving around.

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm very excited about that because I think this actually works.

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And I'm waiting to test it myself.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So we got a lot to go through.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And well, let's ease into it here for a second show.

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let's just before we get into it.

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Because this is going to be a major they work for us show.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I can guarantee you that.

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's ease into it nice and slowly here.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You know, Adam Hay, it's a group from Michigan.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Thank her.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Listen to you talk about the assessment you got.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You know, I got a assessment as well.

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And it's going through the process of looking at upgrading now.

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Well, hold on, let me just say.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't have just a assessment.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's a 1A2RG from 1984, I believe.

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So it has a big wing.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's the last time they, the last year they even made the 1A2 with retractable gear.

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And constant speed propeller.

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's a complex aircraft.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's the flying station wagon.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I love it, too.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Also the assessment.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm looking for something that's got a little bit more speed to it.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You got to check out a mooney.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Excuse me.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Did I mention I get 150 knots indicated air speed?

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Mooney Bravo.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Mooney Ovation.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Mooney, a claim.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Wow.

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
To those think of us.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I don't know if it's actually responding to the conversation I had with John C.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
To Vorac over the weekend about the the serious jet, which will be available in 2010,

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
which I'm saving up my pennies for.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh, boy, what I love to have that.

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Well, if we talking about a previous conversation on the Charlie, I'm not quite sure.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But I'm good for now, man.

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I, until I get my, my instrument rating, I'm pretty good with the, with the Delta Sea.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
All right.

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The acclaim actually, I think, what's it?

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Two thirty seven.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What it's rated is.

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, no.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
These are like 190 something.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's those of Bravo.

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The safest airline or safest airplanes in the industry.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There's never been a case of whenever breaking up in flight.

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, I know guys who swear by Mooney's.

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Now, if you should look this up.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
M-O-O-N-E-Y.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Mooney aircraft.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
They're beautiful machines.

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But you know what?

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They're really quite narrow.

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And I do like to take people along for ride once in a while.

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And it's just, it's, it's a little bit narrow.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's, I think I would have to say it's the Ferrari of the single engine in the skies without a doubt.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But also, I want something that's pressurized.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
When I, when I upgrade, I'm going straight up to pressurization so that,

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I can take the lady Patricia with the up to altitude and she won't feel uncomfortable.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So, that's kind of the criteria there.

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Just rock-solves.

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Like, flying a tank through the air.

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm also pre-cultivation to check all those outs.

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And anyway, take care.

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We think they work for us.

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And the tailwinds, my friend.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Now they do tailwinds.

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Tailwinds.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm pretty sure they do work for us.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I just got a reminder of it constantly.

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And boy, are we going to do that today?

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So, one of the things that we never really got into,

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
which I think I brought up a couple of weeks ago,

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
is about Florida-dated water.

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And of course, Florida has been put into drinking water supplies globally.

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Now, often on, lots of countries have stopped doing it.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And in the United States, it's literally by state, I think.

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And of course, the, the big reasoning behind the Florida Asian of the water

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
has, has been, well, you know, it's, come back to tooth decay.

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And, um, which is just kind of weird,

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
because when you go to the dentist and, you know,

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
back in the day when you got your fluoride treatments,

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't know if they still do it the same way.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Um, today.

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But you sit there with these plates of gunk,

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and it would slowly drip down your throat,

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and it would make you all nauseous and shit.

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Uh, but you were definitely when I suppose to swallow it.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And, you know, when I'm drinking tap water,

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm swallowing it.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm not necessarily swishing it around in my mouth.

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But okay, you know, um, it's, it's what we've been told.

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So I've been buying it for these many years.

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Until I read the book Legacy of Ashes,

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
uh, which is a history of the CIA,

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and according to, um,

159
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
sources very close to this.

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Uh, that would be my uncle.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Um, it's pretty much spot on.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He says the book is, uh, pretty much the way it went down,

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
which is a sad, a real sad commentary.

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Um,

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
but there is a passage in there where the, uh,

166
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
uh, the CIA talks about, uh,

167
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
uh, I can't remember, it's a report,

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
but it's also a firsthand account.

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Talks about fluoridating,

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
a camps water to make the, uh,

171
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
uh, the guards more complacent,

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and maybe a little bit lazier,

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and generally easier to just go into that camp and get what they wanted.

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Um, and it was just easier to convince them through the,

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
uh, fluoridation in fact.

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Um, and I'd have to, I should look that passage up because I've talked about it a couple times.

177
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Uh, and I will do that.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Um, the person describing this,

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
uh, incident even says that they had overflurited the water and everyone got the runs.

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You know, it's, it's, it's not just an offhand mention.

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's really in there.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And, uh, so it says always made me question fluoridation of water,

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
which I believe is now being started up again in Britain.

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And, you know, you just got to think, you know,

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
why these guys doing it?

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You know, in Britain, yeah, you think that we could do a lot of work on, uh,

187
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
on people's general dental health care here,

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
but seems like fluoridating the water is, uh,

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
it's not really the way to go, you know,

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
how about, uh, putting it on the health care for starters.

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And then this comment came in.

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And once again,

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
made me think about what fluoridating water really might mean.

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Hi, Adam, Eric's performance.

195
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I wanted to talk a little bit about fluoride and my personal life.

196
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I didn't always live in the Pacific Northwest.

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I used to live down in Riverside, California.

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And I was in the rat race man.

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And, uh, our water was fluoride, uh, fluoridated.

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And, uh, and I never even noticed it.

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And, and now I'm up here in Portland,

202
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and we don't fluoride the water.

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And it's like my life got lazy.

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's like everything is more clear now.

205
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's, uh, as if a veil has been drawn away from my eyes,

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and I'm much more informed, uh,

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and active than I care more about what's going on.

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And does that mean that the fluoride did that to me?

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't know.

210
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
But as it's just a great, um,

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
common sense correlation.

212
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Maybe.

213
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You know, maybe.

214
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So, uh, those bastards they worked for us.

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And, uh, I'm going to go down to city hall right down.

216
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Make sure they're doing their job.

217
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We'll talk to you soon.

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah, right on.

219
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You do that, my friend.

220
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So when I get reports like that, I'm thinking of myself.

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Mmm.

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's very, very strange.

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And in particular, when I see, I was actually,

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I was just, while he was talking there, uh,

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I was seeing if I could find a recent report.

226
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I thought that there were, um,

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
hmm, let me see him.

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Maybe I'm not, I'm on the UK thing here, honor.

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah.

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's interesting.

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Mmm.

232
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Let's see.

233
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Floor dating water.

234
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Searching.

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So I'm going to just sort by date.

236
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That's probably better.

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Ah.

238
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's all US, US, US.

239
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Maybe I should just try fluoride.

240
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Fluoride in water.

241
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Hmm.

242
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Somewhere I saw that was happening again in the UK.

243
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I've got to go back and check that, which I will do.

244
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Because I think it's happening, my friends,

245
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
particularly in light of what we're going to talk about.

246
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Um,

247
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
regarding the actual reasoning behind the high price of crude oil.

248
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I think the squeeze is, uh,

249
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
is coming to fruition.

250
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And in fact, there's pretty much general information out there.

251
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The things are starting to happen.

252
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And it's just little things.

253
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But it's always the little things that you see first.

254
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And before you know it,

255
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
the cage has fully enclosed around us.

256
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Check out Charlie Delta Lima,

257
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
our favorite Charles the Drunken Lundor,

258
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
what happened to him just the other day in the city of London.

259
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Adam, hi, Charles.

260
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Uh, I was going to just call in and say to anyone that's interested in broadcasting

261
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
or, uh, some of it's shaped nothing.

262
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And anyone who's interested in broadcasting,

263
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
should listen to Stephen Fry's latest podgram.

264
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Haven't done that yet.

265
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Charles, but I certainly will.

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
About the BBC.

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's well worth listening.

268
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Okay.

269
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The other thing is, I just want to stop to search for a policeman

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
a common garden tube station.

271
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Listen to this,

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
common garden tube station.

273
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Uh, common garden is a beautiful place of London.

274
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I think it's W1 or W2.

275
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You know, it's, uh, it's just beautiful.

276
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's high class.

277
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's, uh, very expensive.

278
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's, but it's beautiful.

279
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's a nice area.

280
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Nice surrounding.

281
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Charles gets stopped at the tube station.

282
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's the subway.

283
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Randomly stopped, I presume.

284
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, no reason.

285
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He just said, can I have a minute?

286
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Nice and cool.

287
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes, sure.

288
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
At which point?

289
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I didn't want to allow to leave while he searched me.

290
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I had to give over my personal details,

291
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
or which issue may weren't going any further than on this piece of paper.

292
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, he, I presume, would be a constable, uh, a police official.

293
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So, registered.

294
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So, he said, yes.

295
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I said, well, he can, well, it's an ID.

296
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
No, he said.

297
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I said, well, I'll give you a fake, uh, name and a death sentence.

298
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That's all right.

299
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And he just looked at me and shrugged.

300
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I said, what a waste of time.

301
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He said, you need to speak my supervisor.

302
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I just had a whole massive on conversation about how it was for my protection.

303
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Why is taking my name?

304
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Well, I was on stood outside of a Tuesday,

305
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and it was all these onlookers.

306
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And passing judgment as to why I've been stopped in their heads.

307
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Mainly weren't who cares.

308
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's not the point.

309
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
They're taking my name and addressed it.

310
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
For what reason?

311
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
How is that protecting society that that man's looked in my bag?

312
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Really?

313
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's ridiculous.

314
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What a waste of time.

315
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm ashamed of this country sometimes.

316
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Many of that.

317
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yeah, sure.

318
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'll work for us, then.

319
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah, hell, yeah.

320
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah.

321
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yeah.

322
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
My friend, my friend, it's starting.

323
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And if my research from over the weekend is correct,

324
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
this is just the beginning of a very painful journey.

325
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But of course, we can stop this.

326
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So let me tell you what I've learned.

327
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
One thing led to another, actually.

328
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I was turned on to this energy-saving device,

329
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
or concept, really, of which a number of devices are made,

330
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
called the Hydroxy Booster.

331
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And I'm going to talk about that a little bit later on in the show,

332
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
which is basically a very simple way to create hydrogen

333
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
from water, from electrolyzing water.

334
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So basically putting a current through water,

335
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and mounting a small set up in your automobile,

336
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
creating a vapor of hydrogen,

337
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and injecting that into your engine,

338
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
basically through the air filters, through the manifold,

339
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
or the air intake.

340
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And it's quite amazing because people are achieving

341
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
if I can believe the results are spoken to a few people personally on the phone,

342
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
who say they are seeing these results of fuel efficiency improvement.

343
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And sometimes, well, the average claim seems to be about 25%.

344
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But I have seen claims up to 50% or even higher.

345
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Which, of course, when you're talking about $4, a gallon of gasoline,

346
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
if you can get 25% efficiency, that effectively is a buck less.

347
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So that's a really big deal.

348
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And that's a short term solution we're going to have to implement

349
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
in order to get through the following period.

350
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And this period is not going to be good.

351
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And this period is probably for the next six months.

352
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Let me explain.

353
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So I ran across, I'm going to bring up curry.com

354
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
where you can find this for yourself.

355
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So in my research for alternative fuel, et cetera,

356
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I come across a link, which leads to a Google video,

357
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
which is a lecture from a guy named, there he is,

358
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
a guy named Lindsay Williams.

359
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Now, Lindsay Williams looks a little bit like Charlottom,

360
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
hasden, by the way.

361
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And this is an hour and a half long speech.

362
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah, back in the early 70s,

363
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
he was a pastor on the North, on the Alaskan pipeline project.

364
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And he was there for many years.

365
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
He was basically the pastor and, you know,

366
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
of course, in a way psychiatrist and a sounding board

367
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
for the thousands of men who were working up,

368
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and women who were working on the Alaskan project,

369
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
the Alaskan pipelines.

370
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And so he actually, he befriended a lot of people

371
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and including the CEO of one of the large oil corporations

372
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
at the time, which I think has since been bought

373
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
by one of the other big six,

374
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
what is it, five or six companies that you have now.

375
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And so it became very close, and he actually witnessed

376
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
in a board room, and this was in the mid 70s,

377
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
when they struck a huge oil field on the northern slope of Alaska.

378
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I think that's what he says, the northern slope is the way he calls it.

379
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Or the northern shelf.

380
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And this oil field in Alaska, which, of course, is US territory,

381
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
is perhaps the largest in the world.

382
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And he was there when they were celebrating

383
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and just freaking out about how this was going to be headline news

384
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
the next day, this was going to be it.

385
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Finally, America had energy independence from the rest of the world.

386
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Our worries are over.

387
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
We could be filling up gas for a bucket gallon,

388
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
at least by today's prices, buck buck and a half.

389
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
A lot less back in the 70s.

390
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And they were all elated.

391
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And this guy witnessed it.

392
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
He keeps talking about how he was there.

393
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The next day, he gets called in and they say,

394
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
look, you never heard about that.

395
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That never happened.

396
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
We can't talk about it.

397
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And there's a couple of reasons.

398
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And this guy actually wrote a book called The Energy Non Crisis.

399
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
William's L-I-N-D-S-E-Y.

400
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Williams.

401
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And he goes on in this lecture, which you can watch,

402
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
at curry.com.

403
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Just watch the Google video.

404
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
He goes on this lecture to describe,

405
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
basically why the price of oil is so high today,

406
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and who is in control of the prices.

407
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So it gives us a little bit of a history lesson.

408
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So again, this is like an hour and a half,

409
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
but it'll really help if I give you the synopsis.

410
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
There won't be a big surprise.

411
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Pay off at the end, because I'm going to tell you

412
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
who's jacking these prices up.

413
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
My theory is not far off from Lindsey Williams theory.

414
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And I'm saying theory, because I don't know if it's true,

415
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
but man, this guy comes across as incredibly credible.

416
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So you'll remember, some of you remember,

417
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
if not, you can look it up in the mid-70s.

418
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Henry Kissinger was the Secretary of State,

419
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I think, or was the Minister of Foreign Affairs,

420
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Secretary of State, I believe.

421
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
He went around to the Middle East at the time when,

422
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
by the way, in the 60s, and the late 60s,

423
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
a decision to pretty much been made by the powers that be,

424
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
that we were going to be an economy based on crude oil.

425
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And that mainly has to do with transportation and plastics.

426
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Everything that's plastic eventually comes from crude oil.

427
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So although it's not the largest use as far as I know of crude oil,

428
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
it certainly is a very important one.

429
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So crude oil was going to be our economy,

430
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
particularly as it comes to transportation.

431
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So that decision was made.

432
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
There were a couple of decisions they could have made.

433
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I presume if you're going by 2020 as hindsight, right?

434
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But it was kind of a setup because here's what they did.

435
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Henry Kissinger went to the Middle East and went to every single country

436
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
when they were still, you know, camel jockey's riding backwards.

437
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And he said, you know what?

438
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
We're going to buy oil from you.

439
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
We're going to make you rich.

440
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
We're going to make you rich beyond your wildest dreams.

441
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
We're going to make you leave your harem rich.

442
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Okay?

443
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Now, there's only one thing we do.

444
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
We're going to sign this contract.

445
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And we're going to buy all of your oil.

446
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
But the deal is A, you're going to only buy and so you're only going to sell all oil

447
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
to anyone who wants it in the US dollar currency.

448
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And B, you're going to take a portion of percentage,

449
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
which by the way, Lindsay Williams never mentions what it is.

450
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
But you're going to take a percentage of the money you receive for your oil.

451
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And you're going to buy the American National debt with that money.

452
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Okay?

453
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Now, this corroborates, by the way, with the book,

454
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Confessions of an economic hitman by John Perkins,

455
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
which I have talked about before, and I've talked about it with John C.

456
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
to Warack, I know, agenda.

457
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Where, indeed, these economic hitmen went into all these countries

458
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and would convince the leaders to basically sign on the dotted line,

459
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
by the way, giving them hundreds of millions of advance,

460
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
you know, just to start off with.

461
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And they would then receive all this money from the World Bank

462
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
and the International Monetary Fund to get set up,

463
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
to get everything rolling, and subsequently,

464
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
so there's a lot of, not real money flowing back and forth,

465
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
but a lot of paperwork, a lot of computer database entries

466
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
as to who owed what, because these guys, of course,

467
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
were actually buying the American debt,

468
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
which by the way, today, I think stands at nine trillion dollars.

469
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
How do you run up debt, by the way?

470
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Well, one way to run up the debt is by giving everyone

471
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
universal health care, that would be a way.

472
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But of course, the way that is typically chosen by the United States

473
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
is to wage war on people, and war, of course,

474
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
always makes some people a very few incredibly rich.

475
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
That's the whole military industrial complex.

476
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So they got this rolling, and of course, the entire United States economy

477
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
now relies on the fact that oil is traded a button sold

478
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
in the US currency, so there's always a need for dollars,

479
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
and you can see where that has now gotten a little bit out of whack,

480
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
where the value of the dollar has gone down,

481
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
so more dollars are printed by the treasury,

482
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and we kind of get in this weird spiral.

483
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
But why the high oil prices?

484
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Well, here it comes. You're going to love this.

485
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So there's a couple of steps before oil gets into your gas tank

486
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
as gasoline.

487
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
The first is getting the oil out of the ground,

488
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
so that's what they do in the middle east.

489
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
They get it out of the ground.

490
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Then there's a middle guy, and that middle guy basically determines

491
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
what the price they're going to pay for that crude oil.

492
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And then that middle guy, again, he's sitting in the middle,

493
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
enables the refineries to buy it.

494
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Now, of course, the refineries have benefited tremendously

495
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
from these high prices, but they are not the ones to blame.

496
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
They're not the ones jacking up the price.

497
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Of course, they're benefiting from it,

498
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
but they are not at fault.

499
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And of course, from the refineries, it gets their gas stations

500
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
and gets into your tank.

501
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So who actually manages that little in-between piece

502
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
when it comes out of the ground in the middle east?

503
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Just imagine it's spurting out of the ground

504
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
now it has to be traded to anyone who wants to buy it

505
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
and, of course, in US dollars.

506
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
That, my friends, is the World Bank.

507
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The international monetary fund.

508
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And they do that.

509
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And this is all according to Lindsey Williams,

510
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
but Boyd is the sound right to me.

511
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And they do that with a calculation.

512
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Part of it, of course, is the, you know,

513
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
the national debt gets purchased back,

514
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
but they literally can decide what the price is going to be today.

515
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It's completely up to them.

516
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
If they said tomorrow, you know what?

517
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
We'll make it a hundred bucks.

518
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
They could make it a hundred bucks, no problem.

519
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Because the middle east, they're just saying,

520
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
all right, yeah, what are you going to pay us for it?

521
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
They're not negotiating.

522
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
They're just taking whatever is decided by the powers that be.

523
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
In this case, the World Bank of the International Monetary Fund.

524
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Now, there were two countries in the Middle East,

525
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
who did not sign this deal when Henry Kissinger went around

526
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
getting everybody to sign up to a fantastic way.

527
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And by the way, it's, what a great idea.

528
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I can totally understand the scam

529
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and how they set it up.

530
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And it's obviously very, very controlling.

531
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But in a way, genius to set it up to have the American economy

532
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
basically continuously be fueled by literally fueled by crude oil

533
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
and the fact that everything is bought and sold in dollars

534
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
and that a portion of all the money spent

535
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
goes straight to financing the national debt,

536
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
which, of course, made a whole bunch of other people really,

537
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
really rich think about how a burden as an example.

538
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Can you guess which two countries didn't sign the agreement?

539
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
The first one was Iraq.

540
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah, what a surprise there, huh?

541
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
That's why George H. Bush had to go in

542
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and had to go and kick Saddam's ass and get him in the line

543
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
because he was threatening all kinds of shit

544
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
about what he was going to do with his oil,

545
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
which, of course, is one of the three largest oil fields

546
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
in the world underneath Iraq.

547
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And he failed basically.

548
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
He had to wait eight years for his son to do it.

549
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That's right.

550
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
George W. Then George W. has succeeded

551
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
because he went in.

552
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
He had, well, effectively Saddam was saying

553
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
got taken care of.

554
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And as you know, the large oil companies are now splitting up

555
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
all the money there.

556
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
They're taking care of everything.

557
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
They're splitting up the oil and they have control.

558
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Of course, it's, you know, democratically approved contracts

559
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
and all that kind of crap.

560
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But we know who's really in control, right?

561
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So he succeeded.

562
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Interestingly, though, even though we have all this new oil

563
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
that's going to be coming in, haven't had oil from Iraq

564
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
for the past 30 years in the United States,

565
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
interestingly, price of oil hits 142 goes up a little bit higher.

566
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Hmm, I wonder why.

567
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Well, what's the other country do you think?

568
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yes, the other country that never signed,

569
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
the agreement is Iran.

570
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Now does that war-mongering and saber-raddling start to make sense?

571
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Why does even Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama?

572
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Why are they saying, oh, yeah, you know,

573
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
well, you know, if there's, if we weapons a mass destruction

574
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
we got to go in there and kick Iran's ass.

575
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It's not about that.

576
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
According to this theory, what's happening is Iran

577
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and you can look this one up, just Google it,

578
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
has threatened two things.

579
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
One, they're going to set up their own oil exchange.

580
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
We've talked about this before.

581
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Two, the oil exchange will trade in euros,

582
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
not in the dollar.

583
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So, if Iran and, of course,

584
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
they've actually promised to flood the world markets

585
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
with cheap oil traded in euros.

586
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So let's just imagine that happened for a second.

587
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Iran, which is one of the top three, you know,

588
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
largest oil fields in the world,

589
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
just like Iraq and Saudi Arabia.

590
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And, of course, we have Alaska in the US,

591
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
so let's say, top four, top five.

592
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
If they tomorrow decide to flood the world with cheap oil

593
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and base the payments on euros,

594
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
the American dollar will collapse overnight,

595
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
including the entire economy.

596
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I mean, people will be, as far as I can see,

597
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
will be taking wheel barrels full of money

598
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
to just go buy bread, familiar, doesn't it?

599
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Sounds familiar.

600
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So, of course, the exact same would have happened.

601
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
If all of a sudden, the word had gotten out

602
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
that, oh my goodness, we have all this oil.

603
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
We're no longer dependent on foreign oil.

604
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Everything we need for the next 200 years is available in Alaska.

605
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
What would happen?

606
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
We'd have no one to buy our national debt.

607
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
The exact same thing would happen,

608
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
the dollar would collapse.

609
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
There's a tremendous conundrum.

610
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And from what Lindsey Williams says,

611
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
all these guys are in audit.

612
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Everybody knows it,

613
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
but they can't, as he says,

614
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
they can't tell the American people because,

615
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
well, I guess we'd freak out.

616
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But what they have decided to do instead is to bomb a ran.

617
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And from all the data I've been able to collect,

618
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
it appears that this moment of a ran flooding

619
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
the world markets with cheap oil is drawing close.

620
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
They're oil trading boards.

621
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
They're exchange.

622
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Opened in February.

623
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Now, it seems there were some sabotages

624
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
to their undersease cables.

625
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
You might have picked up on that here or there

626
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
that some cables were cutting.

627
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
There was a question as to how that happened.

628
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Well, it totally fits in the line now with this story.

629
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And they're open.

630
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
They're trading.

631
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And indeed, they are trading in euros.

632
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
There's not a lot of activity going on as far as I can see.

633
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But all they need to do is say,

634
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
you know what, guys, we've got tons of oil over here.

635
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Once you get it, we'll sell it to you for 20 bucks a barrel.

636
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But oh, by the way, it's not actually in bucks.

637
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You're going to pay, I guess it would be like 12 euros a barrel.

638
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Could you imagine that?

639
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So this cannot happen.

640
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And this is the reason why there's,

641
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
there's all this threatening language going out towards a run.

642
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Now, why is the price of oil still so high?

643
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So I think we can kind of draw two conclusions here.

644
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
One is, someone needs to be making a shitload of money.

645
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
That would be the world bank.

646
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
What are they doing?

647
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
They're trying to, I guess, repay or pay down the national debt

648
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
before any huge massive event would take place.

649
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Like, you know, if, for example,

650
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Iran flooding the world with cheap oil,

651
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
can you imagine that if we had a $9 trillion debt,

652
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
$9 trillion of national debt,

653
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
that all of a sudden, you know,

654
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
can barely be paid off because no one's trading oil

655
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and dollars anymore.

656
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And that would be, you know, that would be horrible.

657
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So I think what's happening here,

658
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
and this is kind of what William says,

659
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
we are actually at this point,

660
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
being taxed through the high fuel prices,

661
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
paying back our own national debt.

662
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Other countries are paying back national debt.

663
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Interestingly enough, all a whole bunch of third world countries,

664
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
all of their debt got wiped off.

665
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
The world banks said, hey, you know, you guys are done.

666
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You don't have to pay us back.

667
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I think it's because we've paid it back.

668
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So this warrants a lot of investigation.

669
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Because if what this Lindsey Williams says really is true,

670
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
and this is a video you'll see this from October 2007,

671
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
where the price of gas were still around

672
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
under $3, and he literally sits there and predicts he says,

673
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
the price of gas is going to be $45 very soon.

674
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And if we don't do something about this,

675
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
if we don't force George Bush and Dick Cheney to come clean

676
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and say honestly, what's going on and why they went into a rack

677
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
and why they want to bomb Iran,

678
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
if they don't just come clean and say it so we can have an open dialogue

679
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and work on this problem as a global population,

680
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
then indeed we're in for some shitty times.

681
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Shitty times ahead my fellow chuckleheads.

682
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And I'm not looking forward to that.

683
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
When I hear all these calls coming in about Florida,

684
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
should I hear noise about randomly being searched in London?

685
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Makes me worried.

686
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So what can we do about it?

687
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I'd like to hear from you.

688
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'm going to play a song for you now,

689
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and then we'll talk about how at least we can stay mobile while we're fighting

690
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
this seemingly crazy situation if true.

691
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Let's just assume it is for arguments sake, okay?

692
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000

854
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,040
little hotel California where you can check it, check out, but you can never leave.

855
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:34,480
How do we power ahead? How do we keep moving with four to five dollar a gallon

856
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:41,440
gasoline and really nine to ten dollars over in Europe? Well, I've been looking

857
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:48,440
around and so I came up with this concept and really the original bleed I got

858
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,440
was from a couple of sites where I read about this guy named Stanley Myers.

859
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,440
You may remember him, he apparently created a dune buggy that ran completely on

860
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:07,440
hydrogen gas, created on the fly from water, which is just fabulous. Now, he passed

861
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,440
away, of course, as all kinds of conspiracy theories about what happened to him there.

862
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,440
And I've really been researching from most of the weekend and it seems like this whole

863
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,440
interim step, this process called hydroxy boost, which is basically creating a

864
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,440
little bit of hydrogen on board while you're driving, mixing that with the fuel.

865
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,440
Of course, the hydrogen is going to take place of regular fuel, but it also burns.

866
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,440
So you're basically using, yes, less gasoline. And, you know, you're supplementing that

867
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,440
with with gases, which consist of hydrogen, which will also explode and will also

868
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,440
power your engine. And I've been looking at all these science that have been

869
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,440
cropping up. And of course, this is not really a business. You know, I see a lot of

870
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,440
people trying to make a business out of it. And you could make one for yourself, you know,

871
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,440
by yourself, for yourself from parts from a hardware store, probably, you know, if you're

872
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,440
a novice or if you're even expert, even better, if you really good with your hands

873
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,440
unlike myself, you could probably make one for like 50 or 60 bucks, get all the pieces

874
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:14,440
that you need. So these people out there selling kits, you know, ranging from

875
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:22,440
what looks like a jam jar with electrodes in it and some pieces of tubing to

876
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,440
really nicely constructed aluminium things. I mean, there's a whole range.

877
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,440
But really what's interesting to see is that these sites have really, you know,

878
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,440
they've been around for a while. This is not a new technology by any means. In fact,

879
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,440
you know, creating, you've probably seen this at school at high school, maybe even

880
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:45,440
in your science class, where you create hydrogen from two electrodes, put into

881
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,440
water, you put a current on and then you can ignite it and it will actually burn or

882
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,440
depending if you if you trap it or if you can make it explode. So these sites have

883
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,440
been cropping up in the past six months. And this is obviously because now it

884
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,440
really makes sense. You know, if you have a little bit of fuel efficiency, and again,

885
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,440
the jury's kind of out, but it looks like fuel efficiency is somewhere between

886
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,440
25 and 50 percent. And it, of course, reduces your CO2 emissions because

887
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,440
part of what you're burning doesn't actually release any CO2 emissions, because

888
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,440
the, the final product of exploding hydrogen is water.

889
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:29,440
Now, that said, I want to try one out on the, on the jag. I desperately want

890
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,440
to try one out. And, you know, I've, I've spent probably in total 10 hours

891
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,440
non-stop in aggregate, 10 hours of looking at different sites, looking at

892
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,440
different kits, you know, there's, you know, do I need some kind of electronics to

893
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,440
fool my, my engine management into, because of course, it's a newer vehicle

894
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,440
into thinking that, you know, the mixture has to be leaned a little bit. There's

895
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,440
a whole bunch of stuff. And I'm sure out there somewhere in the audience is either

896
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,440
a chucklehead who is experienced enough and understands this that he can enlighten

897
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,440
us, or perhaps even people who are already doing this. I've not heard a single

898
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,440
person ever mentioned a hydroxy booster. Hydroxy, also known as an HHO

899
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,440
generator or a hydrogen generator. You know, there's all kinds of sites. And

900
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,440
most of these sites are, you know, bordering on MLM type activity, multi-level

901
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:26,440
marketing. Um, it's like, you know, fuel, water, car, dot com, and go ahead and just

902
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:33,440
Google, um, hydroxy, hotel Yankee, Delta, Romeo, Oscar, X-ray, Yankee,

903
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,440
booster, hydroxy booster. Go ahead and Google that and you'll find a whole bunch of

904
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,440
sites. Uh, maybe I'll put a couple of them into the show notes at

905
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:46,440
resource.com. But man, oh, man, I'm very excited by this because for a relatively low

906
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:52,440
cost, I'm seeing testimonial. And I spoke this morning to someone in, uh, in Holland,

907
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,440
who's actually had one installed for six months. He says, I'm getting, um, about a

908
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,440
40% increase in, uh, in fuel efficiency miles per gallon. It says the car runs

909
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,440
quieter. It runs better. And it feels like it has more horsepower, which is by the way,

910
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,440
you know, kind of the same benefits we saw with biodiesel. Although biodiesel is still,

911
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,440
you know, you really got a, you got a process that you got to make it, you got to

912
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,440
make enough of it. And this, you know, you're talking about, you know, like a

913
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,440
leader of water. And you can drive five, six hundred kilometers on that. And it

914
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:29,440
will supplement, um, it'll supplement what's going into, you know, the, the, the

915
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,440
mixture that's going into your engine. Therefore, effectively reducing the amount of

916
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,440
water that you have to use. I mean, if it really does work, and this is, and again,

917
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,440
for everything I'm seeing, I think it does work. I can desperate to try one out.

918
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,440
I don't know if there's anyone in the United Kingdom who's doing that. I'd love to

919
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,440
get something local because I'm sure that me with my two left hands, I'll need some help

920
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,440
installing it. It's not really difficult because essentially nothing goes into the

921
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,440
engine. You know, you install the unit. You got to hook it up to power. Um,

922
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,440
and of course, you got to, you know, set it properly. So it gets to, you know,

923
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,440
it's all about the management of how many amps you're putting into the water to,

924
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,440
to start separating the, the water out, breaking it down to produce the hydrogen.

925
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,440
And, you know, then also the thickness of the tubing that you want to,

926
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,440
literally stick into your, your intake. So your air filter is pretty much where

927
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,440
most people seem to be sticking this tube. So, you know, it's completely

928
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,440
removable. You can take it out when you sell the car. Um, and, you know,

929
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,440
and this is like a non business community oriented type thing that we could

930
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,440
really work on together. Again, no one is going to make this a business because

931
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,440
all you're doing is selling pieces of plastic that fit together.

932
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,440
And the total value of the parts really isn't all that high.

933
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,440
And it's kind of like, it's like an open source thing. You know,

934
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,440
there's, yeah, there's patents all over the place, but the basic principles

935
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,440
everyone can apply. So, you know, there's no one who can really corner the market

936
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,440
hence doesn't seem like anyone is really doing anything on any kind of scale.

937
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,440
If someone is, please send me a link. If not, let's figure it out together

938
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,440
and I'm desperate to try this out. This is so exciting to me if it actually works.

939
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,440
So what should we do? Want to play on now? I'm not going to play another song.

940
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,440
I'll just end this show. Let me see. What do we have to time watch? Yeah, perfect.

941
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,440
Okay, so hopefully tomorrow I'll have some answers and we'll go down these two trails.

942
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,440
Again, I'm looking for corroboration of the Lindsey William story,

943
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,440
which is just frighteningly you think about it. And of course, a

944
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,440
minor little light there at the end of the tunnel of our hotel California is the

945
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,440
fact that we might actually be able to travel cheaper. Shipman, I'll fit

946
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,440
off at one of those suckers on the Delta Shira. I'm loving that idea.

947
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,440
So until we speak again, keep the voice mail lines buzzing. You can find them at

948
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,440
dailysourceco.com. Drop anything you feel is relevant to the

949
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,440
chuckle heads at drop.io slash daily source code. And of course, you can always email

950
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,440
email me at amercurry.com until we meet again.

951
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,440
Live your life with passion and while it lasts. Enjoy your freedom.

952
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,440
Another fine, medium presentation. Stick it in your ear.
