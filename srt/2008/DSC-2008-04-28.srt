00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:23,240
do the update on that, and I'm a 3-dayer for the week, I mean, and the folder, thank you.

181
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,080
Oh, I'd forgotten about that. This is, this is that news report that's been circling

182
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,200
around that says men who masturbate at least five times a week have less chance of getting

183
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,280
prostate cancer. So I know I'm certainly going to be okay. Now I do question if it can

184
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,240
just be sex, and if it doesn't have to be necessarily sex with yourself, if any kind

185
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,960
of sex qualifies. In fact, John C. DeVora, can I talk about that on yesterday's No Agenda,

186
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,800
which might want to listen to? Three-timers, well man, you got to catch up. You don't want to catch

187
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,480
nasty stuff. So up the quota a little bit, my friend.

188
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,400
Hey Adam, it's East. You've got to go.

189
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,240
Ah, Shabbat Shalom, my friend.

190
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,160
Ah, so just listening and hearing about voicemails from Ms. Geller from I need you. Oh, yeah,

191
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,800
man, big knee a culp on this one. I'm sure that's what you've thought is calling about.

192
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,280
All right, hit me, man. It's Masha, yeah. Mike Alpha Sierra, who tell Alpha.

193
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,640
I know. I really messed that up.

194
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,320
Castale's Weasel Greg was listening and he says, dude, dude, you know her name.

195
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,320
I don't know. What can I say?

196
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,880
Yes, Masha Geller. So the whole point was she called in once going to be on a panel at

197
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,640
I media, and I said, and I don't think anything has really happened. I don't think the

198
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,200
charcoal heads had taken any action because I have not heard from her or nothing has come

199
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,680
back. The whole point was, if she sends me, you know, my favorite kind of picture I'd

200
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,200
be willing to accept her, her offer.

201
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,120
She has no Romeo in her first name, and Dan, she is fine looking.

202
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
At least that headshot they have on her website.

203
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,680
Hell yeah. Yeah, good luck with the, I would tell him, make a picture for the panel

204
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,200
thing. Anyway, love you. Hope you win fantastic care. Shabbat Shalom.

205
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,840
Shabbat Shalom. You have to thank very much, buddy. You should be our, you should be

206
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,640
our, are you disappointed? I got, you know, I got to talk to Jeff Smith. We have spoken

207
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,040
a couple of times over, over email about a couple things, but I think what I should do

208
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,800
is I should get a list together of the current savants we have, you know, a monetary

209
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,560
scientist. I got to get some jingles, and that means work for Jeff, and that means I'm

210
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,720
going to pay him, obviously. But we, I think we should just do a one big session, we

211
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,560
do like four or five, because we are lacking in a couple.

212
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,480
Hi Adam, it's partially checking in. I just wanted to put you right. It wasn't me that got

213
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,000
both of them. Unfortunately, it was Paul Nichols, and the really sick thing was that you

214
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
was done over again four days later. So, you know, my heart goes out to Paul. You've

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,280
been voted twice now, and I hope they catch the bastards and rip their arms and make

216
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
so I'm going to take it.

217
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,160
All right, Barkey, thanks, man. That really sucks. But hey, you know, that's what all those

218
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,440
cameras are doing, right? Aren't those cameras supposed to bring down crime and, on

219
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,400
the, especially at two times in a row, within four days, you'd expect that these millions

220
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:19,800
of cameras in the UK would stop crime and it's tracked. Of course not. That's just there

221
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,680
to spy on you. Oh, man. That's pretty disappointing, actually. I mean, I don't know what

222
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,040
the situation is with his house, but clearly, that surveillance system isn't working. Unless

223
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,680
of course, they're using it for something else other than actually surveying crime.

224
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,320
Let's have a word with the Nile on. Let's break the news with the smile on where the

225
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:51,120
wrong old right. We go for light. Let's listen to the Nile. Oh, yeah, he's back and he's

226
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,520
changed his tune. Adam, you know, it's the Nile on. Let me stop by saying this is a

227
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:04,400
seminal moment in our relationship. That is because I totally agree with you only issue

228
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,640
of China. Oh, wait, I think I should just replay that one. I just want to hear him say it

229
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:16,280
again. I totally agree with you only issue of China. Nice. Now, at a conceptual, metal

230
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,600
level, I agree, which is the point that if you wish no man woman or child is free, until

231
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,840
every man woman and child is free. So, you're right. Why are we just focusing on China?

232
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:35,120
There is inhumanity across the world. Has anyone ever heard of Lake Providence in Louisiana?

233
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,200
Has anyone been to Mississippi? The poor state in the USA? Lake Providence among the

234
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:48,960
poorest places in America. 75% of people below poverty. Highest levels of mortality

235
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,560
and drug use, teenage pregnancy in the US. Hmm, I think I should put this on my vacation

236
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,360
destination. With demonstrating to help those people, who is in Mississippi to help

237
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,560
radio levels, which is remaining the poorest state since the Civil War, where the protest

238
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,640
is in America, where the protest is in the UK for chef field and hull among the most

239
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,760
oppressed places in the UK. People out of work, drug use, violence, teenage pregnancy,

240
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:25,200
unemployment. Who is complaining to disrupting things, get politicians, get on things

241
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,400
in their own backyard, and that's why I agree with you. So, Lake Providence, Mississippi,

242
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:37,040
chef field, and hull until the Americans and the British take care of their own backyard.

243
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,520
They shouldn't be going in there worried about the debt. In fact, probably most people within

244
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:48,160
five seconds couldn't put their thing on the map and find where the debt is. Symbarway, Sudan,

245
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:56,720
North Korea, where are the protest? Where are the non-African people protesting Symbarway? I've

246
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:05,040
not seen one protest of people of non-African descent talking about Mugabi, not one. Maybe I'll be

247
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,960
out there, I haven't seen it. So Adam, I agree with you. It's not about China, it's about

248
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,440
four-old. No one is free until everyone is free. So we protest things in our own backyard and

249
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,440
fix our own backyard. Let's not be going into other people's business. We have no license to do it.

250
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,040
I agree with you. What can I say? Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

251
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,360
Oh, and I see still gets this slam in there at the end. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

252
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,200
Nylon, I appreciate it, man. Absolutely. Of course, I agree completely with that.

253
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:50,400
And this talk about China, not just on this show, but also in no agenda has resulted in a lot of

254
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,080
conversation. I'm going to play a couple of them. Don't worry, got some other stuff coming as well.

255
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:01,280
But this is top of mind. And in particular, what hit a lot of people, and I'm just, well,

256
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,160
I'm going to play a couple of pieces of voicemail and it really freaked me out to hear this.

257
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,200
I coupled the, it's an age-old proverb. I don't remember who said it. I'm sure I could look it up

258
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,600
and find it. But the statement is, every country gets the government, it deserves.

259
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:26,160
And wow, you know, the response is to this, particularly as it pertains to China,

260
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,320
have been pretty unbelievable. From people who I consider to be my friends by, you know,

261
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,720
osmosis or by email or because their chuckleheads or contributed to the show, whatever.

262
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,520
And my opinion in my friendship doesn't change, but man, we have to rectify some thinking here.

263
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:49,120
We kick it off with the guy who I respect enormously, who does a show called hoothype.com.

264
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,480
He's been calling into the Charlie for a couple of years. Jay Mack hit it, man.

265
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,920
This would carry Jay Mack from hoothype.com. And I got to be honest, I was putting mulch in my yard.

266
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,880
This I love. Here's the big hip hopper. And put mulch in his yard. And of course, every single time

267
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,760
you think of mulch, now we have to think of the daily source code. Because clearly,

268
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:15,040
there's listen into it while he was mulching. Yes, I run hoothype.com and I put mulch in my fucking yard.

269
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:22,160
Yes. Anyway, I was putting mulch in my yard and I hear you talking about the Chinese government

270
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,160
and how the Chinese get the government they deserve. And if they have a problem with it, they should

271
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:35,440
revolt rise again. You know, not at all. The problem is, is that China is not like the United

272
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,320
States. And I'm sure you're well aware of the fact that China is a communist country.

273
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,160
And I don't know that I need to remind you about a Tiananmen square. I mean, when people attempted

274
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:54,080
to do that, was the college students or a thousands of them there, thousands. And what did the

275
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,200
Chinese government do to payment with their tanks and mold the fuckers down?

276
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,400
Oh, man, you think we're that far away from them? Do you think the protesting in the United

277
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,840
Kingdom is pretty much a band any legal? I don't think we're that far away from their so-called

278
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:15,360
communist government. Yes, by the way, the guy, you remember the student who stood in front of the

279
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,120
tank? I think that was there was a very, I think he was very successful with what he did.

280
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,840
Those pictures were broadcast to the world and it changed opinions or refreshed memories for

281
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:32,080
lots of people. So of course, that is important. And yes, it did make a difference. One step in

282
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:38,320
perhaps a long path, but you can't say it was a complete failure. Here we are talking about it.

283
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,440
All kinds of people die and to this day the Chinese government denies it even ever

284
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:55,040
happened. So my point is is that you can't just tell the people of a country that you can just

285
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,720
up and rise against when you're in a communist country, it doesn't work that way.

286
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:07,040
You know, the idea, the... Yeah, how Jay Mac, my friend. I know you don't mean it this way,

287
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,800
but this is almost a slap to every freedom fighter. Every member of any resistance in any

288
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:20,880
occupation or war from an outside or internal source, there have been hundreds of thousands,

289
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,880
maybe millions of extremely brave men and women who have fought against oppressive governments against

290
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:35,200
Hitler. Come on, if people didn't rise up and didn't fight, then we might be, you know,

291
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,440
I don't even want to go there. But the things that could be happened right now,

292
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,200
the world would be a very different place. So, you know, the only way to fight is not by just

293
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,480
voting or just yelling. Sometimes you gotta get up and you gotta fight. The government holds the

294
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,280
stronger man. They've got the weapons. Select these people can organize and revolt.

295
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:02,320
Oh, that is so untrue. This is what history is almost based upon and revolt uprising.

296
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,920
It happens all the time. And by the way, look at the French. Look at the French.

297
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:17,120
You know, you can... Yeah, sure, they may be a republic and have a democracy or be democratic

298
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,600
thinkers. But if the people don't get what they want, they rise up and burn the shit down.

299
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,760
And it works. I get weapons and, and, and rise against and, and take over so the government doesn't

300
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,720
work that way, man. It's sure does. And I think there's more Chinese who are not in the army than

301
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:41,120
Chinese who are in their vast military structure. There's no way. It's just, it's not logically

302
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,360
possible. Then you need to think about it. I don't know. And that's just the way I feel about it.

303
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,440
Maybe I took your words incorrectly, but they kind of caught me out of the crowd. They've seen

304
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,440
like a very educated individual, especially when some two countries abroad were not. But

305
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,680
that really caught me out of God. It just doesn't make sense. There's no way that a country,

306
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:07,280
especially with China, with all the poverty they have. And, you know, then at the time in this

307
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,040
government, there's no way they would be able to overthrow the country. So I disagree that the

308
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,760
China has the country, the government that they deserve. disagree, man. All right. That's cool.

309
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,440
That's cool. But you are wrong, unfortunately. Because again, the country gets the government.

310
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,920
It deserves. Governments sometimes are installed. The old governments are overthrown.

311
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,600
Governments are removed. New governments are put in place. And the United States of America,

312
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,880
its government was created as a revolt against the monarchy in England. People said this

313
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,440
ain't working for us. Well, let's think of something. What can we do? Well, we could

314
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,000
try and overthrow the king. Or, you know, why don't we go start our own country and run at the

315
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,760
way we want to? And have the government we deserve? That of course was the original intent.

316
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,040
And some of that is slipped. And again, we here in the United States have the government we deserve.

317
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,480
The government, by the way, I heard to both candidates for the Democratic nomination,

318
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,120
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, saying that, hey, we have the nuclear weapons to

319
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:22,080
what was the word obliterate Iran? Do who'd what kind of crap are we talking? Of course we do.

320
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,480
But man, what is that talk about? Shiver me, Timbers, well, there's more people who

321
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,520
misunderstood or I think are probably just misled. And and have to understand that, you know,

322
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,680
it is we the people in every country. It's absolutely true. And you know what? People probably

323
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,400
will have to die if you want to change something. That's just the way it is. But we're like

324
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,160
pussy's over here, man. Oh, the only way you can change something is by voting.

325
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,320
You know, it doesn't seem to be working too well. My friends, that voting thing.

326
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,760
I'm Chris and I'm down again on social day of 70. There's a fundamental flaw in your statement.

327
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,320
You say the people fundamentally get what they deserve. Now, I said they fundamentally get the

328
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,880
government they deserve, but okay, I'll let you slide. But there's a significant flaw in that.

329
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,320
The individual does not get what they deserve. The people as a whole get what they deserve,

330
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,920
the kind of that ignores manipulation. So without manipulation, that statement is correct. It

331
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,480
changed people to a society. For example, me as an individual. Right now according to your logic,

332
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,040
the proper action for me to take is to drive down the Washington B.C. walk into the White House

333
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,320
place, place under arrest and you share the government in this place. No, I never said that.

334
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,920
I never said that. That's your interpretation of what I said. But, you know,

335
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,200
marches on Washington have been quite successful in the past. But you got to go do it. Someone's

336
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,720
got to organize it and go march. What's the result of that? I go to jail. Tell you in simple.

337
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,400
Oh, right. So stay home and do nothing. It doesn't matter if I'm right at all because they

338
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,960
have a bigger stick than I do. No, he's got a bigger stick. So I can't come up for what I think is

339
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,200
right. And visually, we can do almost nothing. It's at a whole that we actually have the power to do anything.

340
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,000
Do you have any idea how difficult it is to organize a group of people as a whole to do anything?

341
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:21,760
Yeah, absolutely. It is very difficult to organize a group of people who are so hypnotized by

342
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,720
mainstream media stories about Nicole Richie, Britney Spears, Lindsey Lowhan, Amy Weinstein.

343
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,120
We argue about DRM and how evil it is while kids are getting shot and killed in the desert.

344
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,160
Yeah, I understand it's very hard because we have all these much more important things to talk about.

345
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,920
Like my iPod doesn't work. Please.

346
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,600
Leave under the current moniker of this country that no one else wants to do it.

347
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,320
Why am I going to stick around it down? But of course, everybody thinks that way. So everybody says nothing.

348
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,320
So listen to it. Right. Yeah. Well, it starts with talking about it and from talking we got to

349
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,560
get this action by friend. That's for sure. Because we're just being fed a big pile of bull crap

350
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:18,400
from from news organizations. And the go back to what the nylon said. You don't hear about

351
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,640
Louisiana. You don't hear about, uh, she was at Shepherd's Bush. Is that what he said? And how?

352
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,760
Because that's not what is important to the politicians at the moment.

353
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,400
That, therefore, it doesn't get reported on. Luckily, though. Thank goodness, we have what I would

354
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,680
almost want to, it's like a first time caller. But close enough to reaching savon status immediately

355
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,920
from New York Bulls, I Johnny. Adam, it's Bulls, I Johnny from New York City. Hell yeah.

356
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,960
It's just something I'd share with you. This whole thing with the government. We deserve the

357
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,600
government that we have right now. This is our fault. It's something I like to call the devolution

358
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,400
of the American man. If you look at our fathers, I think you and I are about the same age Adam.

359
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,600
Our fathers had a whole different life than we did. They fought in battles. They lived through

360
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,000
a depression. They stormed the beaches of Normandy. That was just that tougher generation.

361
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,760
Well, what did we have to do? The toughest thing I had to do when I was a kid was figure out

362
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,360
which led Zeppelin out in the by. I had no worries. I mean, we came from a middle class family.

363
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:27,040
I had everything I wanted, wasn't like luxury, but it was a stress-free childhood. Now our children

364
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:34,320
are like real. So the Americans things have to get really, really bad before they get any better.

365
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,080
That's how this country was founded. So when the oil runs out and the shitty little gadgets from

366
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,280
China start to break, then all hell is going to break loose. It's time we need to organize it

367
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,160
now. You're right. We have to rise up and we've got to figure out a way to get back to that

368
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:56,320
toughness of our parents generation. And we've got to do it now for our children's sake.

369
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,880
So get together and organize. When gas hits four dollars a gallon, you happen to do something

370
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,480
about it. Stop driving your car. Figure out a different way. Do it now. We'll be about

371
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:14,080
me 43 public relations professional in New York City, two kids,

372
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,600
folder and scruncher. I'll go both ways with that one. Thanks Adam. Bullseye, Johnny Man,

373
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,160
love you. Thank you so much for calling in. And the only person who could say it better is the guy

374
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:32,800
that just turned 70 years old. And when I'm saying that, I'm purpose because when someone turns 70,

375
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,160
you know, this is how someone's been around for a while. They, you know, you should listen to

376
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,720
what they have to say. You know, remember this whole respect, your elders thing? Well, this guy

377
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,600
just said another HBO show, another show for HBO, I should say. One of his infamous routines and

378
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,440
John C. DeWire, DeWire, I turned me on to it. He actually burnt it to his DVD for me, but it didn't

379
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,480
work. And he told me what it was. And of course, it was very easy for me to find and just went to video.

380
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:05,520
Google.com and those intellectual property thief's over there. Of course, had everything nicely listed.

381
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,200
You don't hear about that anymore. Do you, you know, when there's stealing content left and right

382
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,320
and it's been up there for a couple months, you know, nicely categorized, not hard to find anything.

383
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,920
It's probably crossposted on YouTube. But anyway, this is the guy who without doubt

384
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:28,320
has pushed his finger right on the open wound of the postification of the United States of America

385
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,400
and probably countries around the Western hemisphere. Listen to a couple minutes

386
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:40,560
of George Carlin on our kids. It focuses bad for you. It's all bullshit. That's what you have

387
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,880
to remember. You go through life in this country. It's all bullshit and it's bad for you.

388
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,960
Now speaking of parents, speaking of bullshit, two ideas which aren't always mutually exclusive,

389
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,400
by the way. I'd like to mention a special kind of bullshit that has taken hold in this country

390
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,600
in the last 30 to 40 years. It's a form of bullshit that really only can be called child worship.

391
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:13,200
It's child worship. It's this excessive devotion to children. I'm talking about today's

392
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:21,680
professional parents. These, these obsessive, diverse sniffers who are over scheduling and over

393
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,280
managing their children and robbing them of their childhoods, even the simple act of playing.

394
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,760
Even the simple act of playing has been taken away from children and put on mommy's schedule

395
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:48,800
in the form of play dates. Something that should be spontaneous and free is now being rigidly planned.

396
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:56,640
When does a kid ever get to sit in the yard with a stick anymore? You know, just sit there with a

397
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:08,640
fucking stick. Do today's kids even know what a stick is? You know, you sit in the yard with a

398
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:25,040
fucking stick and you dig a fucking hole. You know, and you look at the hole and you look at the

399
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:32,080
stick and you have a little fun. But kids don't have sticks anymore. I don't think there are any

400
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:40,640
sticks left. I think they've all been recalled because of lead pains. Who would have thought that one

401
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,640
day the manufacturing of sticks would be outsourced to China? But you know, something a kid shouldn't

402
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,920
be wasted as time on a stick anyway. If he's four years old, he should be home, study in for his

403
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:58,160
kindergarten entrance exams. You know, but that should only happen now. Yeah, yeah, there are places

404
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:05,200
that have kindergarten entrance exams. The poor little fuck. The poor little fuck he can barely

405
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:16,320
locate his dick. You know, and already he's being pressured to succeed. Pressured to succeed

406
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,680
for the sake of the parents. Isn't this really just a sophisticated form of child abuse?

407
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:33,920
Speaking of that. Speaking of child abuse. Speaking of child abuse, next stop. Great school.

408
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,120
Great school. Who won't be allowed to play tag because it encourages victimization.

409
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,920
And he won't be allowed to play dodgeball because it's exclusionary. I have provoked

410
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,280
aggression standing around is still okay. Standing around is still permitted, but the won't be

411
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,760
for long because sooner or later some kid is going to be standing around and his foot will fall

412
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,080
asleep and his parents will sue the school and it'll be good by fucking standing around.

413
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,120
Now fortunately, all is not lost. All is not lost because at least we know

414
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,040
that when he does get to play whatever games he is allowed to play, the child will never lose.

415
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:27,680
We know he'll never lose because in today's America, no child ever loses. There are no losers anymore.

416
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,560
Everyone's a winner. No matter what the game or sport or competition, everybody wins.

417
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,440
Everybody wins. Everybody gets a trophy. No one is a loser. No child these days

418
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,240
ever gets to hear those all important character building words. You're lost Bobby.

419
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,960
You're lost. You're a loser, Bobby. They miss out on that. You know if they tell a kid who

420
00:30:50,960 --> 00:31:00,960
lost these days, you were the last winner. A lot of these kids never get to hear the truth about

421
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,840
themselves until they're in their 20s when their boss calls them in and says, Bobby,

422
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,720
play the shit out of your dressing. Get the fuck out of here. You're a loser.

423
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,800
Man, George Cardano, I love that guy. He's so incredibly on the ball.

424
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:22,800
If you don't have HBO and you can get it, please go and get HBO. I'd love to support them

425
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,360
for bringing great stuff like this to television. There is still hope, even though it's not

426
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,560
publicly accessible television. Unfortunately, there's just no other way to get it if you can't get

427
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:41,440
HBO, but man is that guy awesome. I love it. Listen up, so go ahead. This is for us from Washington.

428
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:49,840
Clicking over the DSC. Listen up. We have a low-than-off opportunity. You know, that has

429
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:57,840
re-establish this human connection through the voice, it's through podcasting. And our global forum

430
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:07,440
isn't the DSC. We need to start giving solutions. We have to give ideas, have big ideas.

431
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,400
It doesn't matter. We have the collective dollars to make things work. That is step one.

432
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:23,120
Be proactive in what we think. Step two, we have to implement those ideas and report back

433
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,160
and only through this two-step process. We even begin to take back what is ours. We do not

434
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:39,600
have to live in a macavillion world where the few and corrupt are the only ones competent enough

435
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:50,480
and willing enough to make the world their own. We can do this. We have the power, but we will

436
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:59,120
be nothing but servants, dogs of the elite if you sit here and listen to Adam and the savants a year

437
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:06,000
out what the world is in this current status. That may not be good to understand the future,

438
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,080
but the future will continue on its current path unless we make changes and the changes will

439
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:20,240
come from the people. Adam is behind us, the savants are behind us, but that is not enough. We must

440
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:28,240
make ourselves known. We must put the power back in our hands. Now, what do you want to do?

441
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:35,520
You want to listen to me and you're going to think to yourself, what can I do? Because until you do,

442
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,640
nothing will happen. And once you think, you must now act to tell us,

443
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:51,680
talk about what we can do. And then we must, as listeners do, what is said, try what is said.

444
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,920
This is a daily source code.

445
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:05,040
Adam, hey, Dave Jackson from the Musicians cooler. Wanted to give you a special heads up about this

446
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:11,280
week's episode. I mean, can anyone say bummer the charts 2008? Because I'm interviewing

447
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:18,400
Shannon Curfman. This is an artist who had a major deal at the age of 14. And this powerful

448
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:25,040
vocalist, hugely talented guitar player, had her first album go out toward the world when she got back

449
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,800
in the infinite wisdom of the major record label, tried to turn her into Britney Spears. It's

450
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,240
like turning Led Zeppelin into the back street boys that ain't gunna fit. And you know what,

451
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:43,360
she stuck to her guns. And even though they held her career hostage for years, she came back in 2007.

452
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:48,560
She is rocking harder than ever on her own record label. You can check out our new album,

453
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,960
fast lane addiction at emusic.com forward slash music news and get that album for free.

454
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,600
If you are a musician, you need to stop by musicians cool.com as I interview Shannon Curfman.

455
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,880
It's time to bummer the charts, man. Oh yeah, I'm forcing the force to grate here,

456
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,080
hope you win. I love you no home home. Oh yeah, scruncher.

457
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,280
Oh, for this is just like professional lives, you know what I'm saying? Wow, wow, listen.

458
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:37,440
It was your nigga. It was your nigga. It was your nigga. It was your nigga. It was your nigga. It was your nigga.

459
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,720
It was your nigga. It was your nigga. It was your nigga. It was your nigga. It was your nigga.

460
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:31,440
It was your nigga. It was your nigga. It was your nigga. It was your nigga. It was your nigga.

461
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:41,600
It was your nigga. It was your nigga. It was your nigga. Was your nigga. It was your nigga.

462
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
For my people survival is self-steam

463
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,040
I want your fight for racist churches

464
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,240
We sound fun, they're good

465
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,240
I'll be fighting and keep the hockey pace out

466
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,640
My nigga, whoever clocks someone who talks shit

467
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,040
Look at your bowl and imagine if they shot at you

468
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,640
I was raving with your moms

469
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,240
And of course that I'm insane

470
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,240
Had chemical weapons we sold in that shit

471
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,240
Have the Ronald Reagan's election

472
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,240
Most of every contract is fighting

473
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,240
And we have a former military bank

474
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,840
And all the war on terror

475
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,640
They control in the ghetto with the fear of attack

476
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,040
Trying to strike the fact that they engineer in the crack

477
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,960
So I'm scrap-likely malvo

478
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,240
Holding a sniper rifle

479
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,680
These bullets are touch of kids

480
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,440
And I don't mean like microwave money

481
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,120
You send to the wall, strip down

482
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,720
And cycle that fire on a house

483
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,320
Because that's what you would like

484
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,200
You was innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily

485
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,960
And poor people never get shit

486
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,000
Struggle daily

487
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,960
You say no alien, conspiracy, dirty shit is real

488
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,560
Written on a dollar underneath

489
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,600
The Masonic seal

490
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
I don't rap to get presidents

491
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,440
I'd rather see the president dead

492
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,480
It's never been said

493
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,840
But I said presidents

494
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,960
I didn't blow a project

495
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,400
It was your nigga

496
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,680
Tell a joke, nigga

497
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,880
Stocked down, nigga

498
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,400
Tell a joke, nigga

499
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,840
Stocked down, nigga

500
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,280
Tell a joke, nigga

501
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,080
I didn't blow a project

502
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,520
It was your nigga

503
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,560
Tell a joke, nigga

504
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,000
It's an eight seconds away

505
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,360
From the side of some cops

506
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,560
From the front building

507
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,600
They hit the head out

508
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,960
Was it a hit-out?

509
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,640
Must have a mortal technique

510
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,480
And M&M tell the truth

511
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,640
Had just scraped that one off of YouTube

512
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,640
and I realize that's not such a good idea because, well, I knew this sound quality would be inferior, but it's also mono.

513
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:40,640
But it's good to hear protests alive and well in hip-hop, bring it on, bring more of it, please.

514
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,640
Hey Adam, this is another hit test and we're going to start right away. We're going to throw number one.

515
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,640

00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,640
Are you kidding me, Adam?

517
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,640

I know that one too.

520
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,640
One of the few concerts I went to as a teenager, all in oats.

521
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,640
I can't go for that.

522
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,640
And number three.

523
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,640
You know, the young always has to put one in that I absolutely know chance of getting.

524
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,640
It looks like two out of three stars for today's show.

525
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,640

Answer number one is from 1979.

529
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,640
This is earth with fire, a September.

530
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,640
Number two.

531
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,640
Can't believe it's a timber.

532
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,640
Filled anything.

533
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Number one is 25.

534
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,640
This is answering number two.

535
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,640
You're coming to the room.

536
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,640
In 1982, all in oats.

537
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,640
And I can't go for that.

538
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,640
I can't believe it.

539
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,640
I can't believe it.

540
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,640
I can't believe it.

541
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
I can't believe it.

542
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,640
You're going to stop when you're down.

543
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
I need to throw the line.

544
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,640

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
I can't go for that.

546
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,640
You're all in oats.

547
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,640
You can't do it.

548
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
I can't go for that.

549
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
You can't really.

550
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
I can't go for that.

551
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640

hello Adam mevio carry here is your European correspondent me this is me so do you remember your

568
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:49,000
old car the Trinity well European Union is back pedalling down on biofuel because

569
00:42:50,760 --> 00:43:01,000
as you might know or not increased demand for biofuel in EU and USA has caused hunger in poor countries

570
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:11,400
before saving planet we have forgotten about people the biofuel do good as actually did

571
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:22,680
evil the and the by the way I have heard that curry fort is nowadays less popular in UK

572
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,560
I mean I think for some people they think what is actually British food kibab well it's not

573
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:34,760
a terrorist or curry it's not in fact curry is fallen out of favor curry's are going out of

574
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,800
favor now nobody's really interesting curry's any more the interest is is tailing off of rake

575
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:47,640
which is a shame so Adam please ensure and the same will not happen to mevio in

576
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:53,960
you media arena you I'm sure once you get that RSS feed implemented for comments in

578
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:04,200
blogger our EU correspondent then of course a bunch of the charlie everybody nice to have in back

579
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:10,600
I disagree though I think that just like we're being gained and being ripped off on fuel prices

580
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,800
and oil watch for the announcements now it's earnings time once again and look for the big

581
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:25,480
billion dollar profit announcements from the oil companies they are ripping us off big time so I

582
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:32,680
kind of have to believe that the food importers or the growers or let's just call that industry

583
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:39,960
are probably taking advantage of this exact mean that you've grabbed onto com extra blogger

584
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,720
I have yet to see some real conclusive evidence of this that's just not enough people driving

585
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:53,240
on bio fuel yet for the price to have multiplied by it's in some cases 10 times in a very very

586
00:44:53,240 --> 00:45:02,040
short amount of time I think it's again people are just ripping us off I have absolutely no belief

587
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,960
that is taking place at this moment I really don't think that's uh that's the case

588
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,920
and we're just being ripped off we definitely have to revolt against this this is uh

589
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,320
ah boy well anyway I got a company to run and then we'll go save the world and win

590
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:25,240

JavaScript that's a whole new site that has to be built I need to calm down that I need to

607
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,040

608
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:56,040
You have just yourself grey, a puzzle pool, by any other name.

00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,040
Won't go away when I feel it all the way.

You love no, you love no, you love no, no, you love no, no.

624
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,040
We'll count higher and higher.

625
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,720
Hold the dime

626
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:23,040
You have just to say I'm to blame, I'm to the blue, I'm by any other name

627
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:32,040
You have no one more than blame, you have no one else

628
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:37,040
You have no one else, you have no one else

629
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:45,040
You have no one else, you have no one else

630
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,040
Yeah, that's one from the soundtrack to my life, all right?

631
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:53,040
Presented, of course, by the organizers, for the preservation of the soundtrack of our life under its educational auspices

632
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,040
Because we need to share these memories amongst ourselves, friends

633
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,040
I think it was a young poet who sent me this, could have been rare, not sure

634
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:07,040
But thank you anyway, high gloss from my high school days when I was on pirate radio in Amsterdam

635
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,040
You'll never know, and it was exactly what I needed to wrap up the show for today

636
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,040
Because I just needed to calm down a little bit

637
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,040
Hey, I'll do another show for you tomorrow and Wednesday, maybe even Thursday

638
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,040
Friday, maybe a problem this week

639
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,040
Because I'm accompanying the lovely lady Patricia to her first live show

640
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:30,040
Which will be broadcast live Friday night

641
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,040
So I'm a little looking forward to that, this should be a lot of fun

642
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,040
Anyway, we'll talk more tomorrow, you know how to reach me, it's adamatmevio.com

643
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,040
The show notes, of course, dailysourcecode.com

644
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,040
And there's my weblog, curie.com where I do post things from time to time

645
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,040
That are outside of the context of this program

646
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,040
And I look forward to talking to you guys again tomorrow

647
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,040
So please, I hope that I've fired you up, you got to live your life with passion

648
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:58,040
And you have to, you must absolutely enjoy your freedom

649
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:02,040
Another fine, medium presentation, share it with a friend
