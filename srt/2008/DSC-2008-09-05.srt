1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
September 5th, 2008, it's Fubar Friday.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is the Secretary of War at the State Department of the United States.

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We have a problem.

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The company wants something down about the sluggish world economic situation.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The problem is that the running bar is a little thin lately.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We need to manipulate some growth.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We know that there's a alarmingly high number of young people running around in your country

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
with something to do with a drop from over the police.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The damaged private property all says it will fight forever.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
About time, this is the biggest struggle with these people.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Thousands of near-two are crawling over.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The companies think it's time to laugh the sound of a series get together

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and start another war on home.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
A president who already loves the idea of all of those miserable,

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
dreaming over his two bro, people running down the road,

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
thinking not to fire.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, don't just leave up for us.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The government thinks it's been a real thing for years.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, we're gonna move going away from the minister's brazeness.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh, hell.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I can't have said no fun with that.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What do you say?

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, we don't even have to win this war.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We just want to cut down on some of these things.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There's no relation.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now that you've started the draft,

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
the draft is meaningful.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We can, we'll call up every last gun

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
so we can get our hands on it.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Give them an hour or two to learn how to use an automatic rifle.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We'll end them on their way.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh, follow on.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We don't have Northern Ireland.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We're proud to be a president of South America.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, well, let's just cook up a good,

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
so be a threat story in the Middle East.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We need that oil.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We're going to be already done.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Girl, we can not think it's just a grudge.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's even show up.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, I can't.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That man is unrivaled.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, we're right in the feather figure of a bunch of like we did for that one.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Just cook for a minute.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh, we can make this war.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So be it.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So be it.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The more people he killed in this war,

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the more the economy will prosper.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, we can get rid of practically everybody on your own.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Do, do, you do.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Come.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We won't be here tonight.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Take every blow for our welfare right off the theater.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, no, where is our food demonstrator?

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Just pump up your truck for temporada.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thank you so much.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Have a couple of Pupples, some dot hair on it,

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and Mbem!

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That means some sweet Wegover.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Puss and brag, do you hit next?

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We ain't everywhere, dear neighbours.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We ain't everybody posing with MSD,

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
They never got to, your ride.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
All right, you have to learn a bunch of things that's fine.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's easy.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
All right, we've got our cards, kids.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So interested in beer.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Very good beer.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
We've got many factors here, Bob.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Again.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh, no clear.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Thought I was there back here.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't even know what it looks like.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But how about it?

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's excellent.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We knew you to agree.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The companies will be very pleased.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Delta share a Charlie 787.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's fine, everybody.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's time for the football.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
For $60 million worth of beer, play extrapped by us.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
For the next generation video content in my ears.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We know you're not thinking it turns in.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I like a drink of wine.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You can turn it.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, I've got to take this out of the car.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's a credit with success.

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The ambition for access, access.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
As the top of the month, it comes a bottom line with success.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's a credit with success.

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's time to finish the money.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's the defeat we're really bad for the honey.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Maybe honey, but you money way of mouth, bit run into town.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's been a few months, honey.

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
All of us are sick.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It doesn't feel like freedom.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We're the family, we can't jail.

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We're the living dog who'll pay your praise.

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We're the family, we're the family.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We're the family.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We're the family.

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We're the money we're good.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Success is a credit with success.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We need to find for the people that like sex.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
As the top of the month, it comes a bottom line with success.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's a credit with success.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
All of us are sick.

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It doesn't feel like freedom.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We're the family, we can jail.

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
We're the living dog who'll pay your praise.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

133
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

141
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

142
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,000
it's time for the money we're really good.

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It is time for the money we're really good.

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's time for the money we are really good.

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm really good.

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The money we're really chilling in is great.

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

155
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's time for the money we're really good.

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,800
that makes total sense with all of the Atlantic activity

157
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,800
taking place between Jamaica, Cuba, the South Coast,

158
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,960
the Florida, the Gulf Coast, everything's connected.

159
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,320
So when a butterfly flaps its wings

160
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,440
if it can stir up a hurricane, well,

161
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,440
then you would expect as they're calling them now,

162
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,200
the Atlantic storms to be connected to all of that.

163
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,720
So we've got a lot of wet weather.

164
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,320
We have the chance of some flooding.

165
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,440
It's just another day in the neighborhood.

166
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,840
But yes, everything source from the drop,

167
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,640
drop.au slash daily source code.

168
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,280
Let me just write down a note to myself.

169
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,000
I wanted to put a redirect on,

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,480
I'm going to make drop.daleesourcecode.com,

171
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,280
go straight to the source code drop.

172
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,920
And maybe even I'll make a drop.curry.com, go to it.

173
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,840
Whew, I got some news from those guys.

174
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,320
Later on, today we've got a full blown, full on,

175
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
full bar Friday.

176
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,440
Everything you'd expect, all of the awesomeest music.

177
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,240
And of course, aggregating the real news

178
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,080
from around the world, some things,

179
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,720
super important, some things less important.

180
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,560
First of all, let me tell you,

181
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,720
the thank you all very much for the birthday greetings

182
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,000
that you sent me most of it through email this year.

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
In fact, I only received three physical cards,

184
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,560
which is the least I've ever received ever,

185
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,200
in all 44 years that I can remember.

186
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,600
One from Patricia, one from Christina,

187
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,880
and one from Christina's friend, Dexter,

188
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,240
who I'm sure would be hearing about

189
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,320
in future episodes of The Charity Dexter's cool guy.

190
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,480
Finally, a boyfriend, I actually kind of like off the bat.

191
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,440
And everything else came through email.

192
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,480
There was so much, literally,

193
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,200
and I haven't been able to respond to it all.

194
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,520
Of course, I've marked everything.

195
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,280
Oh, make sure, I send a nice little note back to everybody.

196
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,040
I hope I make it through as you so much,

197
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,240
just so much that came in.

198
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,120
And the email's been hopping in general, man.

199
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,920
It's like, all this stuff has happened at the same time.

200
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,640
We've got, well, we're gonna talk about that today.

201
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,480
We've got Georgia heating up again.

202
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,600
We've got possible Iran attacks heating up again.

203
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,920
We've got the financial crisis melting down even more.

204
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,200
Of course, we've got the biggest show on,

205
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,680
or the second to biggest show on Earth,

206
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,720
I'd have to say the Republican National Convention,

207
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,240
still number two to the Democratic Convention,

208
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,160
television wise, from a show perspective,

209
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,920
show business, as you know, politics is, of course,

210
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,680
show business for ugly people.

211
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,800
But with Sarah Palin in there,

212
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,880
they've got some good actors.

213
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,960
So that part, I really like.

214
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,800
And news today, I've been waiting for this

215
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,680
when I haven't looked into the official report yet,

216
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,360
but the news is on that British Airways triple seven

217
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,760
that landed short of the runway.

218
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,240
He threw about a thousand feet short,

219
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,880
and severely damaged the plane.

220
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,800
And one person was seriously injured,

221
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,320
but everyone else was okay, of course.

222
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,880
They're saying, now, it was ice in the fuel line.

223
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,440
Whoa, that doesn't sound like, here.

224
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,240
The accident, there was not the fault of the flight crew,

225
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,560
as the Air Accidents Investigation Branch

226
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,120
has said in internal reports.

227
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,520
So once again, this is another internal report,

228
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,800
not the full blown deal.

229
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,520
It also ruled out the problems with the amount of quality

230
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,080
of the fuel focusing instead on build up of ice

231
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
in the system.

232
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,480
This is not very good, and I'm not quite sure how that happens.

233
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,400
I don't know enough about these aircraft,

234
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,240
but ice in the system, it's not supposed to happen.

235
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,360
And still, I guess there's no word on holding

236
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,600
down the entire fleet.

237
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Oh, here we go, Boeing recommended all 11 airlines globally

238
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,320
that fly triple sevens with the Rolls Royes engines,

239
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,320
including American and Delta Airlines,

240
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,680
takes steps designed to minimize chances of ice build up.

241
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,840
This sounds like a pretty serious flaw to me.

242
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
So still waiting for the final report

243
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,200
from the A, it was the A-A-I-B.

244
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,880
That's the British version of the F-A-A.

245
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,440
And we're at T-minus five and counting my friends

246
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,400
September 10th will be the 10th day of the nine month,

247
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,280
ninth month of the eighth year of the year's 2000

248
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,760
of the millennium, 2000, second millennium.

249
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,760
That's when they fire up that the L-H-C,

250
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,800
the Lord Hadron Collider in Geneva.

251
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,520
Now, of course, we've talked about this in the Charlie,

252
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,560
and we've gone through multiple explanations,

253
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,640
but still there were not one but two lawsuits,

254
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,640
one from the U.S., another one was European lawsuit,

255
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,200
whose aim it was to stop the physicist at CERN

256
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,160
from flipping the switch on this thing in five days from now,

257
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,440
there's still a concern about creation of black holes

258
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,440
and the earth being sucked inside out.

259
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,160
I don't know, but I don't think they're going to stop,

260
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,400
but I think this thing is all go ahead

261
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,560
and all lights are green, all systems go.

262
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,480
They're still trying to find out exactly what took place

263
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,000
in the split, literally, split second

264
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,640
after the big bang occurred, which,

265
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,520
and here's the thing that I don't understand about this,

266
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,080
because this is a heavily subsidized project.

267
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,400
We have about $14 billion is what it's cost.

268
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,080
I think over 30 countries have participated in the finance

269
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,080
and have scientists on the scene,

270
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,440
a lot of them really young with the snappers.

271
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,280
I can say that now that I'm 44.

272
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,000
But if this is to show something that happened

273
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,320
after the big bang, doesn't that do away with,

274
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,000
I mean, doesn't that go head to head

275
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
with a lot of the Christian Democratic parliament around Europe,

276
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,040
I'm thinking of Germany as an example,

277
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
the Netherlands, this is obviously,

278
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,240
you're talking about divine creation versus evolutionary theory.

279
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,840
How come there's not a whole bunch of religious groups

280
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,600
up in arms about this?

281
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,240
If they're not out to prove that God's for real,

282
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,680
they're out to prove the, well, something they call the God particle.

283
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,160
It's the, what is that called?

284
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,520
The Higgs boson.

285
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,760
Oops, what was that?

286
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,840
Battery full.

287
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,200
Oh man, next week remind me, I want to do a,

288
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,840
I get another little update on the E71.

289
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,960
I've learned some more things, found some new software.

290
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,680
There's the Nokia cell phone that I bought instead of an iPhone.

291
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,800
Pretty much still all good stuff.

292
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,360
I just, I won't have time for it today.

293
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,160
So T-minus 5 and counting, September 10th,

294
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,520
that's, let's see, six, seven, and as I Wednesday,

295
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,200
next Wednesday, let me just check on the calendar real quick.

296
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,800
A bit shit is.

297
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Yeah, next Wednesday, September 10th.

298
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,520
I wonder what time they're gonna fire that thing up?

299
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Wait, it just, ah, kind of, kind of frightens me.

300
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,200
So as I mentioned earlier, I had some news from the drop.io folks.

301
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,160
Well, I think they, they actually called themselves dropio.

302
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,440
Dropio, I'll just call them drop.io.

303
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,960
They have an extra feature, which is not officially released yet,

304
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,080
although it does work.

305
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,240
I don't know if they've put anything in their homepage,

306
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,480
but they call it the paywall

307
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,520
and they've done something really interesting.

308
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,960
You could now, and this is what I like about what these guys

309
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,000
do, and they're just tying in all these APIs

310
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,880
into a basic kind of web-log like format or a storage system.

311
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
It goes way beyond file sharing,

312
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,840
as the chuckle heads will know, we use this extensively

313
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,560
for the preparation of the daily source code.

314
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,360
And it's for links, it's for notes, it's for embeds,

315
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,680
it's for voicemail, which finally some people

316
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,680
starting to use a little bit more, I appreciate that.

317
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,840
But now you can also hook it up to the Amazon Payment System.

318
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,640
So you can close off a drop and give people access

319
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,680
based upon a payment.

320
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,400
So you could say, well, you can look at this one time,

321
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,040
we can look at it for a day, for a week, or for a month,

322
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,640
based upon your payment.

323
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,800
And it all runs through Amazon, which I guess you can

324
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,400
mean, means you can use a credit card.

325
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,440
I don't know if they take PayPal, but certainly a credit card.

326
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,080
And I think this is a very interesting addition

327
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,320
to the drop scenario.

328
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,240
I mean, for instance, you could make, how about this?

329
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,680
If you want to go buy a song, or if you want to sell your song,

330
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,960
or sell anything, any type of digital asset,

331
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,920
you put it into the drop and you say, look,

332
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,080
once you've paid your money, you can access the drop and download it.

333
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,440
I think you could even set it up for multiple accesses.

334
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,080
So you would have maybe 10 times to download something.

335
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,040
There's all kinds of really cool opportunities.

336
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,520
And I'm even thinking, Devor, I can I

337
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,120
might want to look into one of these and see if we can get

338
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,520
to make some money out of no agenda that way.

339
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,960
You know, maybe giving you access to the show notes

340
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,880
for an extra payment.

341
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,440
I don't know.

342
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,720
Well, we'll try anything at this point.

343
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,520
We're so freaking desperate.

344
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,720
But good on those guys at drop.io, because they

345
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,320
whoa, sorry about that.

346
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Because they really got some awesome stuff going on.

347
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,960
And I think it fits in perfectly with what we're doing here

348
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,040
with the audio production distributed independently.

349
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,400
Here's the flow box.

350
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,920
Source from the drop, of course.

351
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
This is We Are Winning on the Charmly.

352
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,920
787, full bar Friday edition.

353
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,920
Driver games are sitting down to the planet

354
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,920
after school program.

355
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,920
The religious fanatic hosts footage of an

356
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,920
interfaith service project.

357
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,920
The group of teenage boys watches a video of a

358
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,920
public page with his son.

359
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
An adult film star.

360
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,920
From their portraits of elderly couples.

361
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Full of love and smiling.

362
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,920
A regular executive, according to the law, is apology.

363
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,920
A policeman makes reverse 911 calls,

364
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,920
instructing residents to nature's streets.

365
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,920
The patriarchy for children.

366
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,920
She's wearing an orange dress,

367
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,920
and holding a kids' line.

368
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,920
She's ashamed of her abilities.

369
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,920
The treat is not an opium.

370
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
Women and children from live,

371
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,920
walk on tuning, stand and be counted.

372
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,920
In the belly of the voice.

373
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
There's no civilians women.

374
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
Children from live listen.

375
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,920
Consider this a disc or the warning.

376
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,920
The virus imminent pollution.

377
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Gathering tough particles.

378
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
What a thing, through smoke stacks.

379
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
Airways, man with.

380
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,920
Disimformation through fetching the labels.

381
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Delete the virus, alert the masses.

382
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
Much of my wing crosswinds.

383
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,920
Send black hawks toward hurricane survivors.

384
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Rose is sprung from empty lungs.

385
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Inside walkfronts.

386
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,920
As if his burikers move undetected.

387
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Through concrete jungles.

388
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,920
New forms are beginning to take shape.

389
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Once occupied minds are activating.

390
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
People are waking up.

391
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,920
The insurgency is alive and well.

392
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Rise to the blue box.

393
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,920
Portrait host.

394
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Do American internship.

395
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
Foundations of the world.

396
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,920
An assembly line.

397
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
Send the resist.

398
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Reviews.

399
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
In 438.

400
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Direct.

401
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Love wants to the traces.

402
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
Super 40.

403
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Rumble into fortresses.

404
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Plast across the globe.

405
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Broken porcelain.

406
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
Rise to black blue.

407
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Red blood stains from decompressed diamonds.

408
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Hammered the battle cry into Braille studded armor.

409
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Building up in you world.

410
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,920
Do not sit tightly by.

411
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,920
Enough remaining neutral.

412
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,920
Do not rely on this broadcast alone.

413
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,920
We are only as strong as our single.

414
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,920
There is a war going on for your mind.

415
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,920
If you are thinking, you are winning.

416
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Resistance is victory.

417
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,920
The defeat is impossible.

418
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,920
Your weapons are already in hand.

419
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Reach within.

420
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,920
And find the means by which to gain no freedom.

421
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,920
Hide with tools.

422
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Your faith is a matter of everyone you know.

423
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Decide subject.

424
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Ain't that the truth?

425
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
The floor box.

426
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
She known from the handlebar.

427
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,920
So I want you to play previously on the Charlie.

428
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
This is we are winning.

429
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Acceler.

430
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
Excellent.

431
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
That's right.

432
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
Just be in a wake.

433
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
We have the tools.

434
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
We have got them.

435
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
And our fingertips utilizing them as we speak.

436
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
Through programs like this.

437
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Very one.

438
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
The daily source code.

439
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Of course, it's the food bar Friday.

440
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Lots of stuff to get through.

441
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Actually, this comment will kick off the next section.

442
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,920
We're going to discuss.

443
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,920
Add a very important.

444
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,920
I was just watching John McCain and the Sarah Palin thing.

445
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
And going, wow.

446
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,920
It's like a magician.

447
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
You know.

448
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
There's a still canker chip over here.

449
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Don't look at what's really going on.

450
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,920
You know, Cheney is in Georgia.

451
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,920
And the Dutch are out of our ran.

452
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,920
There's U.S. ground troops in Pakistan.

453
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,920
What the hell is going on?

454
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,920
There is no coverage in the mainstream media of this stuff.

455
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,920
And you have to hear your opinion on that.

456
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Well, why do we can train my hand?

457
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Hell, yeah, my brother.

458
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
Yeah, of course.

459
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,920
You know, that's that's what it's all about.

460
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,920
I told you the Republican National Convention, just like the DNC.

461
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Biggest show on earth.

462
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,920
The, the second biggest show, the Olympics was used for the.

463
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,920
The cowardly attack of Georgia on to South Assetia, which, of course, has been distorted

464
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,920
in most of the mainstream media as Russia being the bad guys.

465
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,920
Now, Russia not exactly the nicest guys, but they're all thugs.

466
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
And all of them are.

467
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
But that's right.

468
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Dick Cheney got it right here.

469
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Of course, good links in the, in the show notes for today's program.

470
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,920
I've got this new system worked out where it's really easy to transfer all these links over.

471
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
So this is a BBC story.

472
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
U.S. vice president, Dick Cheney has said,

473
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Ukraine has the right to live without fear of invasion,

474
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,920
adding that the U.S. stands by its bid for NATO membership.

475
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Now, notice this is about the Ukraine.

476
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,920
Okay, he's, he's all over the place.

477
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,920
He arrived in Ukraine and then he hopped over to Georgia and just a billion,

478
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,920
a billion dollars in aid going to Georgia based upon, I mean,

479
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,920
it's so easy to see what's happening when you, when you really let it all unfold,

480
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,920
but the, the little details are just phenomenal.

481
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,920
So obviously, Republican National Convention going on.

482
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
That's what's dominating the news.

483
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,920
Cheney's over there and he's, he's hooking up his buddies.

484
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,920
And it's all for good reason because what happens when, I mean,

485
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,920
NATO is not necessarily about protection about, you know,

486
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
if we add Georgia and Ukraine to NATO.

487
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
It's about selling weapons to them.

488
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
That's what it's about.

489
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,920
So these guys won't be tinkering around with AK47s,

490
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,920
which by the way, work pretty well.

491
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,920
They're cheap to make, but you know, it'll be American stuff.

492
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
American weaponry.

493
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
That's what it's about.

494
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,920
So that billion dollars in aid is,

495
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,920
it's, it's really going to go right back into the,

496
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
the military industrial complex.

497
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Unfortunately, you know, these countries will have to pay.

498
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,920
It was a Georgia if they get a billion bucks through the IMF.

499
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,920
Or how it doesn't even matter how is given to them.

500
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
There's always interest on it.

501
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,920
They'll never be able to pay that back.

502
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
And that's when we take over and say,

503
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
all right, well, you couldn't pay that.

504
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,920
So we'll take our collateral, which, of course,

505
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:20,920
is usually taken in the form of rights to minerals and gas and oil.

506
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,920
So the system is still in full swing.

507
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
But this one I hadn't heard yet.

508
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,920
And I, and I did like it as a kind of an extra theory.

509
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,920
News, this is from the Irish Times, IrishTimes.com.

510
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,920
And this is another, a little byproduct of this,

511
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,920
this whole Georgia South, the city, a Russian bad guy thing.

512
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Is that Putin, I'm not Putin, I'm sorry.

513
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,920
It's our cozy.

514
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,920
That's the, the president of France, of course.

515
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,920
And he is, you know, currently they hold the presidency

516
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,920
of the European Union.

517
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,920
And let me see, the headline of this story,

518
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,920
lack of Lisbon Treaty hinders EU response to Russian action.

519
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Well, isn't that interesting?

520
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,920
There are fears in the EU capitals that the crisis in Georgia

521
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,920
could spill over into other countries in the region with large Russia

522
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,920
minorities, such as Ukraine and Moldova.

523
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,920
Speculation about a new cold war is also gathering

524
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,920
either in peace and Brussels, which is move surprisingly quick to put itself

525
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,920
in the front line of peace efforts since full-scale conflict

526
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,920
broke out on August 10th.

527
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,920
I'm going to see if I can find the quote here.

528
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,920
That's our cozy is saying that really neat here it is.

529
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
Here we go.

530
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,920
Negotiating a ceasefire forcing Russia to backtrack on

531
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,920
his decision to recognize the independence of South the city

532
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
and Abkhazia are two different things.

533
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,920
And the results of the summit highlights Europe's limitations

534
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,920
when it acts in the field of foreign affairs, particularly in its

535
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,920
dealings with Russia and then he goes on to say,

536
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,920
look, essentially if we get this Lisbon Treaty work

537
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,920
and then we can really stand together as a united front,

538
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,920
which of course goes right back to what the with Irish who

539
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,920
voted no, the only country of the 727 member states to say no

540
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,920
to the referendum, no to the Lisbon Treaty.

541
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
They were right.

542
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,920
They said, hey, this is about creating a European army.

543
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
They don't want any part of it.

544
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
We don't like it.

545
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
We don't like that way.

546
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
And here it is.

547
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
Circusy saying, you know, we're severely hampered.

548
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,920
We can't do anything because, you know, we really don't have all the

549
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
means. It's all in the Lisbon Treaty.

550
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,920
Do you think all of this was planned one way or the other?

551
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
Do you think it was kind of, you know, this is why they were

552
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,920
rushing to get this thing done by October.

553
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,920
This Lisbon Treaty to form the United States of Europe.

554
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
Wow.

555
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,920
I'd say it sure seems that way.

556
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,920
I'm just going to stick with, with this particular part of the

557
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,920
world for a second article from the Times online.

558
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Even though Georgia is not yet, and it'll take some time and

559
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,920
some ratification and whatever is necessary to get into

560
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
NATO.

561
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,920
Of course, the US were, you know, big proponents of it to start

562
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
off with.

563
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,920
They have already hooked the Georgian radar systems into the

564
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,920
NATO early warning system.

565
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,920
This according to the Times, which I'd say is a pretty reliable

566
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,920
paper in many cases.

567
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,920
And, uh, there we go. Alliance officials alliance.

568
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,920
Who's the alliance? Oh, the US led alliance.

569
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Interesting.

570
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,920
Nice. Anyway, so we're in a new alliance.

571
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,920
Alliance officials said the arrangement enabled NATO radar

572
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,920
specialists to be linked up to the Georgian radar systems.

573
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,920
It means NATO can now see what the Georgians are seeing through

574
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,920
the radar as effectively allowing the alliance.

575
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Start fleet alliance.

576
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,920
Start fleet alliance.

577
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,920
To monitor what is going on over Georgian air space without having

578
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,920
military assets in place.

579
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
Cracky.

580
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,920
I mean, can you imagine someone doing that like in Canada?

581
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,920
Or it just, you know, figure in the US or Mexico?

582
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,920
Or Texas for that reason?

583
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Can you imagine this taking place right across, you know,

584
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,920
sovereign border?

585
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,920
And meanwhile, Putin, I mean, this guy's got it made.

586
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,920
He's, you know, he's paid off the entire debt.

587
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,920
He's paid off the debt, the Russian debt to the international

588
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,920
monetary fund.

589
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,920
Um, paid off all the debt to the Roth child who, uh,

590
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,920
you know, had billions outstanding.

591
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,920
This is, and of course, the way he did it was quite

592
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,920
interesting and, you know, pretty much unscrupulous.

593
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,920
He just nationalized all of the oil companies and the gas companies

594
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
said, screw it.

595
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
We're taking all this.

596
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,920
We need this money.

597
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
We've got to pay off this shit.

598
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,920
So we stand alone without being under control of who typically

599
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,920
runs the world certainly is running America.

600
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,920
The Roth child's Rockefellers, et cetera.

601
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Um, and now he's, uh, a Mr. Hero mode.

602
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,920
If you haven't seen this, you've got to check out the link.

603
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,920
Where he saves a TV crew from a tiger.

604
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
This is pretty funny.

605
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,920
Yeah, a tiger.

606
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
Where were they?

607
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
Where were they?

608
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
We're hunting tigers.

609
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
What were they doing?

610
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
Let me see.

611
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,920
Um, he was taking a break.

612
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,920
Uh, in a national park to see how researchers monitor tigers in the wild.

613
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,920
And then one of them that, you know,

614
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,920
escaped and started running towards a nearby camera crew and, uh,

615
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,920
superhero Putin shot it.

616
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Although it's kind of unclear.

617
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,920
He says, Mr. Putin quickly shot the beast and sedated it with a

618
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
tranquilizer gun.

619
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,920
It does that mean that he shot him with a real bullet first and then the

620
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,920
tranquilizer gun or was he carrying a tranquilizer gun.

621
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,920
And then this other story, which you probably didn't catch.

622
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
I just love it.

623
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,920
Bring on the sleeves.

624
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,920
Oh, shit.

625
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
The page is gone.

626
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
What's up with that?

627
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
Ah, it's horrible.

628
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,920
Well, the page on ABC news, which now seems to disappear from their website,

629
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,920
headline Putin denies affair with beautiful gymnasts that

630
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,920
that we could have some fun with that, but apparently not.

631
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,920
So, um, you know, now on top of the Dutch pulling out of Iran,

632
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,920
because they said that they got word of, uh, some kind of, uh,

633
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,920
event that'll be taking place in Iran, um,

634
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,920
the fact that, uh, you know, it looks like Israel, uh,

635
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Israeli fighter jets and I'll be, uh,

636
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,920
uh, using one of the other airports in Georgia.

637
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,920
You know, it looks like something is imminent.

638
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,920
And it's, it's just, uh, it's so blatant now.

639
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,920
You know, even, even the shit that, uh, the Chinese saying,

640
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,920
and in fact, let me see if I can bring up that story about, um,

641
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,920
it's, it's all about oil.

642
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
It's all about the pipelines.

643
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,920
It's, uh, how they want the pipelines to run.

644
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,920
They don't want to build new pipelines.

645
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,920
So they, they don't go, they don't go through Russia,

646
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,920
but then run, you know, through Turkey.

647
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,920
And meanwhile, you know, what is indeed, you know,

648
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,920
thanks for the call, man, what indeed is going on with Pakistan.

649
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
So now we're in there.

650
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,920
We're ambushing presidential motorcades.

651
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,920
We're landing with helicopters.

652
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,920
And I mean, what the hell, and why is that not being reported on?

653
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,920
Very, very little, in fact.

654
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,920
Now again, you know, my theory that the mainstream media

655
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
has got great journalists, but it, you know,

656
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,920
that it's just not getting through the editors, you know,

657
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,920
the DNA of these, of these media companies aren't allowing it through,

658
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,920
but let's get some, let's get some ink on what's going on

659
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,920
over there in Pakistan because these guys actually do have nukes.

660
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,920
And it seems incredibly unstable at the moment.

661
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,920
But, uh, and all, it's so open now.

662
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
It's completely clear.

663
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,920
It's so easy to see that the Bush administration, Bush

664
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,920
Cheney administration, they have been after oil from day one.

665
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,920
Hundreds of thousands of people have died for it.

666
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,920
And all Americans have that blood on their hands one way or the other.

667
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,920
And we've got to stop it.

668
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,920
So wake up America, please.

669
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,920
And the rest of you, hey, you Brits.

670
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,920
It's, uh, you're in this too.

671
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:01,920
You're a part of the, the Dutch Anglo empire building system.

672
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,920
And I think the Brits are still out to, to crush America.

673
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Certainly looks that way with the, uh, you know,

674
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,920
European Central bank rates remaining at 4.25%

675
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,920
and the UK, I think it's still at 5%

676
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,920
all the money is flowing out of the United States.

677
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,920
You know, it's, it's economic warfare as well.

678
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,920
That's really what it is.

679
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,920
And Russia, I think, has gotten smart.

680
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,920
And they've stepped out of the system,

681
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,920
keeping our eyes on this, keeping our eyes on it for sure.

682
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,920
Hey, and it is, of course, Friday, which means we've got some typical

683
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,920
food bar business to take care of.

684
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
Hey, Adam.

685
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,920
Number 137, and we're going to start right away with intro.

686
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
All right.

687
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,920
Uh, that's, uh, almost a sting.

688
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,920
See the Durandran Sabre prayer, or is the police, maybe?

689
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,920
Number two.

690
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,920
Uh, David Bowie, this is not America.

691
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,920
This is not America.

692
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,920
Uh, that one was easy.

693
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,920
This is like 84, 85.

694
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,920
And number three.

695
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,920
Oh, yeah.

696
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
There will be prints.

697
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,920
And the sign of the times.

698
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,920
Okay, so I'm going to, I'm going to stick with the police on the first one.

699
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,920
I can't remember the name of the song, though.

700
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,920
And time's up.

701
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,920
And this is answer number one.

702
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,920
Number two.

703
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,920
2.

704
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,920
2.

705
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
1.

706
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
One, four, six.

707
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,920
The hell wasn't name in the song?

708
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,920
Here comes.

709
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,920
2.

710
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
30.

711
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
30.

712
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
30.

713
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
30.

714
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
30.

715
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
30.

716
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
30.

717
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
40.

718
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
30.

719
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,920
I think I get at least one point for the...

720
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
for the band.

721
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
Don't I?

722
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
Number one.

723
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
Rats around your finger to the police.

724
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,920
Yeah.

725
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,920
This is answer number two.

726
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,920
Ninety, Ninety five.

727
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
There we are.

728
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
David Bowie.

729
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,920
From the Falcon and the Snowman, the soundtrack.

730
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
For extra points.

731
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,920
For the Snowman, the American.

732
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Hell, no way.

733
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
I'm gonna recall.

734
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
It should all look on the top.

735
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,920
This is not America Day for Bowie's answer number two.

736
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,920
And this is answer number three.

737
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
Oh yeah.

738
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
This is Prince.

739
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,920
In fact, the skinny man died of a big disease.

740
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
With a little man.

741
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,920
Answer number three.

742
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Prince.

743
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,920
Sight of the Times.

744
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,920
And that concludes hit number 137.

745
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
All right.

746
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,920
So Adam.

747
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
How did you do this week?

748
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,920
Well, I actually got five out of six there.

749
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,920
But considering I knew some extra trivia about David Bowie,

750
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,920
I think I got a full six, don't you think?

751
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,920
Oh yeah.

752
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,920
That concludes this hit test.

753
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,920
Thank you for playing Adam.

754
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
Thank you sir.

755
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
Everyone else, thank you for listening.

756
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Next week, I'll hope to be back with another hit test.

757
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,920
And in the meantime, you can find the answers to this.

758
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
And any other hit test.

759
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
And also the links to iTunes.

760
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
So you can buy the track.

761
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,920
Featured on the hit test online at hittest.meapyote.com.

762
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,920
See you next week.

763
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
All right.

764
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
Hopefully.

765
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
So until then, have fun.

766
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
Take care.

767
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,920
And remember to try to think with your hearts.

768
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,920
Bye bye.

769
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
Be back.

770
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Test at gmail.com.

771
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
info.

772
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,920
.

773
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,920
.

774
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,920
.

775
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
.

776
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,920
.

777
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,920
Yo.

778
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,920
Thank you.

779
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,920
I believe I actually skipped over hit test 135.

780
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,920
But I'm going to keep that one.

781
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,920
One of these days, I'm sure young won't be able to make one or something.

782
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,920
I'll go wrong and then I'll have one stacked up.

783
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,920
So young was one of the many people who sent me email a couple days ago when one of the

784
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,920
greats left us just unbelievable.

785
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,920
It was a real shock.

786
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,920
Because, you know, you hear this guy multiple times a day.

787
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,920
If you listen any mainstream media, you know, radio or if you watch television.

788
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,920
But also, he really was pretty big in the podcast.

789
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,920
And lots of people worked with him and ordered up some of his work and his services.

790
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:02,920
Of course, I'm talking about Don Lafontaine, the man who he didn't just, he's not just famous for the line in a world.

791
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,920
But he really changed the face of movie trailers.

792
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,920
Significantly.

793
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,920
Just trailers in general.

794
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,920
And really turned that into a fabulous art form.

795
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,920
And it would just seem like such a nice guy.

796
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Never met him personally.

797
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,920
I know a lot of people who work with him.

798
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,920
And it's a real real bummer.

799
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,920
And he will be sorely missed.

800
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
If you want to know who I'm talking about.

801
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,920
And there's lots of shows out there that have interest from him.

802
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,920
I just dug up two.

803
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,920
I think I got three or four.

804
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,920
Just so you can kind of remember in a way as a tribute to the great voice of Don Lafontaine.

805
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,920
Adam Curry was just a guy with big hair.

806
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,920
He sold his first company and thought he'd just kick back and take it easy.

807
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,920
But he never counted on this.

808
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:59,920
Adam and Patricia, the king and queen of the manner, or just the lady and the tramp.

809
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,920
Only on the daily source code.

810
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,920
Definitely one of my favorites.

811
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,920
And then there's this one.

812
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,920
Of course.

813
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,920
In the world, we're women.

814
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,920
We're comfortable shooting.

815
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,920
And technology has changed the way you get your entertainment.

816
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,920
This is the pod show network.

817
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,920
No big media.

818
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,920
No excuses.

819
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
No BS.

820
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,920
Somewhere he has one with my name on it.

821
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,920
But I couldn't put my hands on it that quickly.

822
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
Rest in peace.

823
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,920
Don Lafontaine.

824
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,920
We shall definitely, definitely miss you, my friend.

825
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
Adam, this is John.

826
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,920
You're going to get some of on the floor convention.

827
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,920
This is the last pedic convention where we're going to nominate John McCain.

828
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,920
As our president, our nominee for the Republican Party.

829
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,920
Last night's wrong.

830
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,920
All of those with a rather quieted down.

831
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,920
I heard only one statement.

832
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
He held his name.

833
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,920
I think that was Alaska.

834
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,920
Most of the other states just didn't say his name.

835
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,920
There is some confusion as to whether or not the votes that were he ended.

836
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
Actually, because we're he ended into the RNC.

837
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,920
We'll be counted for wrong.

838
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,920
If the state delegation didn't have to say his name.

839
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,920
There may be some confusion as to the fact that he didn't get any vote.

840
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,920
So I think that's been reported in the meeting press.

841
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,920
That's actually I think we're a member of.

842
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,920
On average, probably two, three, four, five, six, seven,

843
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,920
go slow on default for the each name out there.

844
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,920
So again, as that will be reported.

845
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,920
And then we'll come out later.

846
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
Maybe some of the check-in to it.

847
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,920
So if you are in the official word as to what happened.

848
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
Anyway, that's your report for tonight.

849
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
Let's fight.

850
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
All right, man.

851
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,920
It was kind of hard to hear what you were saying.

852
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,920
That's why I didn't interrupt.

853
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,920
It was probably the culmination of the cell phone and the crowd noise in the back.

854
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,920
But yeah, from the convention floor.

855
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,920
Yeah, you know, Ron Paul had the rally for the Republic.

856
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,920
And I think it was wildly successful.

857
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,920
Though, of course, again, in mainstream reporting,

858
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,920
almost not present at all.

859
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,920
And so I guess there's some question about the votes.

860
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,920
It doesn't really matter.

861
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,920
I mean, it's all about the show and the television audience

862
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,920
that gets sucked into it.

863
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,920
And the system works perfectly.

864
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,920
It really does.

865
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,920
I mean, yeah, man, turn on Fox.

866
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,920
Fox News is amazing to watch.

867
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,920
But you've got to be careful because you've got to know the code, right?

868
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,920
You've got to understand that that very moment you're watching.

869
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,920
Programming of your brain is being attempted.

870
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,920
And particularly in Carl Roe, man, Kaiser Carl.

871
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,920
And he comes on Fox News.

872
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,920
It's like he's almost like he is truly Dr. Evil.

873
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,920
And you know, he's just sitting there,

874
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,920
country, he's still pulling strings.

875
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,920
Either hammer, some clone or some body,

876
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,920
some central command,

877
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,920
start fleet command that pulls all these strings and comes up with the talking points.

878
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,920
And probably even calls the camera shots for all I know.

879
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,920
It's just amazing.

880
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,920
And of course, that's a press as all the other news,

881
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,920
particularly the Georgia stuff, the Iran stuff and

882
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,920
Henry Boy, how about how about the economy?

883
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,920
Oh, man.

884
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,920
There's a lot going on there.

885
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,920
Let me see.

886
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,920
Oh, I got a promo.

887
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,920
And you know, you used to play a lot of promo

888
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,920
as a daily source code.

889
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,920
And I'd love to get back to playing some more of them.

890
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,920
But people just kind of gave up on sending a man.

891
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,920
I'm not quite sure why.

892
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,920
I'm not sure if promo is or exchanges at all anymore.

893
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,920
They're certainly welcome here.

894
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,920
Obviously, I try to keep in between 30 seconds in a minute,

895
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,920
because sometimes people send it three, four minute promos.

896
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,920
You know, I just don't have the time for that.

897
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,920
But happy to do it, happy to spread the love

898
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,920
if you send it in or better yet to leave it on the drop.

899
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Drop.au slash daily source code.

900
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
Don't adjust your dial.

901
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,920
It's true.

902
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
It's back.

903
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Bigger and better than ever before,

904
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,920

You look particularly lovely today, by the way.

915
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,920
How generic is that?

916
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Thank you.

917
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
I feel so particularly lovely today.

918
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,920

923
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,920
Fuck yeah.

924
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,920
Let's talk about money for a second.

925
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,920
Great article in agorafinancial.com by Ian Matias.

926
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,920
I think that's a high pronounce it.

927
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,920
It's called money to burn, and I'd really like you to take a look at this because

928
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,920
it goes very deep into what the Federal Reserve has been doing

929
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,920
in lending money to banks.

930
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,920
And they do it through a number of different,

931
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,920
well they call them facilities.

932
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,920
So we have the TAF, the term auction facility,

933
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,920
which offers banks billions,

934
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,920
literally billions, and I think it's 28 or 35 day loans,

935
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,920
and it's below the Federal Reserve's published lending rate.

936
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,920
And this is, and it's not, I mean, we're talking,

937
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,920
eight hundred and ten billion dollars that has been lent to financials under

938
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,920
these TAF auctions.

939
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:54,920
In fact, this article takes it even further and says at current count,

940
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:03,920
the Federal Reserve has lent out about 1.5 trillion dollars

941
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,920
to financial institutions.

942
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,920
This is so rough.

943
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,920
And it's so funny because now if you read through a lot of financial news,

944
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,920
you'll see that even the Rothschilds are in trouble now,

945
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,920
which of course is exactly what I've kind of hoping would happen.

946
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,920
These guys got to feel the pain too.

947
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,920
They've got hedge funds blowing up left and right.

948
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,920
They no longer have debts outstanding to Russia as we discussed earlier.

949
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,920
Then there's this T-S-L-F, I'm not quite sure what that is.

950
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:47,920
But it looks like sometimes they're doing 20 billion dollars a day in loans.

951
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,920
And they do it in all these crazy instruments,

952
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,920
and they're essentially shitty subprime rate back assets

953
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,920
being traded as national debt.

954
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,920
I guess they're both worth the same at this point.

955
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,920
But please, don't look at any of the financial markets.

956
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,920
Please pay attention to Sarah Payland and her kids or grandkids or whatever it is.

957
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,920
Please watch the greatest show on earth and don't pay attention to things like,

958
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,920
oh, let's see, the global food crisis.

959
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:26,920
Another good article you might want to skim through.

960
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:32,920
World Bank reports, global food prices rose 83% over the last three years.

961
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:39,920
And 45% increase in the world food price index during just the past nine months.

962
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,920
No wonder people are going to the streets.

963
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,920
I mean, there's countries where Haiti.

964
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,920
Food prices increased by 100%.

965
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,920
Prime Minister was forced out of office.

966
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,920
People took to the streets, people had been killed, injured.

967
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,920
Very little reporting on that.

968
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,920
Very little about what's actually going on.

969
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,920
And this could happen in our backyard.

970
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,920
I'm already seeing the inflation in the UK is well over 10%.

971
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,920
That's what they're reporting.

972
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,920
So maybe it's even higher than that.

973
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,920
People are being pushed towards the poverty line with an amazing pace.

974
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,920
And not to mention, as I said, look at Haiti.

975
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,920
I mean, there's plenty of other countries where it's really, really, really bad.

976
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,920
But that just doesn't reach us.

977
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,920
It's just amazing.

978
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,920
I said.

979
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,920
There's so much to go through with you today.

980
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,920
So now China, which, of course, has been buying up the US national debt,

981
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
every running out of money.

982
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,920
Oh, this is from the New York Times.

983
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,920
Of course, China has been in a buying binge in the states for the past six or seven years.

984
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,920
They own about one trillion worth of treasury bonds and mortgage back debt issued by

985
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,920
Fannie Mae and Freddie Max.

986
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,920
Of course, the value of all of this has gone down.

987
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,920
So what do you do?

988
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,920
I mean, there's only really two choices.

989
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,920
It's just like if you were investing in the stock market, either you take your losses.

990
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,920
And losses on a trillion bucks could be quite a bit.

991
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,920
Or you double down.

992
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,920
So they want to buy more or they're thinking about buying more.

993
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,920
But they don't have any money.

994
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,920
They have the Central Bank of China.

995
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,920
Only has 3.2 billion dollars.

996
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,920
At a certain point, you get used to all these billion numbers.

997
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,920
But there is a limit to it.

998
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,920
There is only so much that's available.

999
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:33,920
And of course, the people's Bank of China, they don't, they like to have some more money.

1000
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,920
They'd like to invest.

1001
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,920
They'd like to double down.

1002
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,920
But China's saying, well, look, we're not going to just print up more money.

1003
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,920
Because that'll cause inflation in our own country.

1004
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,920
Once you understand this stuff, how this economics really works,

1005
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,920
it's so simple.

1006
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,920
And it's all these central banks manipulating everything.

1007
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,920
And they're not working together anymore.

1008
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,920
And it's falling apart.

1009
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,920
Let's see, does anything here?

1010
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,920
This is just shocking, really.

1011
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,920
So they're trying to raise money.

1012
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,920
Where they're going to raise it from?

1013
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,920
Who has money left?

1014
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,920
Russia, perhaps.

1015
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,920
Here it is.

1016
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,920
Here's the story on the banks borrowing more from the Federal Reserve.

1017
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,920
This is just a corner copia of cool news for you to prove through.

1018
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,920
Federal report, and they don't report everything.

1019
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,920
But this is a good one.

1020
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,920
And you won't read this on the front page of USA today.

1021
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:40,920
A Federal report released Thursday said commercial banks averaged 18.98 billion in daily borrowing over the past week.

1022
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,920
That was compared with a daily average of 18.47 billion in the previous week.

1023
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,920
Billion.

1024
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,920
This is nuts.

1025
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,920
They've got to shut it down.

1026
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,920
There's no more money.

1027
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,920
The only way to go is to print even more.

1028
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,920
Keep your eye on that.

1029
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,920
Make sure you know what's going on.

1030
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:08,920
Because, man, I got to go get me some gold bars.

1031
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,920
Having money is useless.

1032
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,920
It's not.

1033
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,920
Not going to be any good anymore.

1034
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,920
No worries.

1035
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,920
Salvation's coming October 14.

1036
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,920
Well, we wish it done the shroud of elders.

1037
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,920
And we're waiting for that money from Ed McMan.

1038
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,920
And we're drinking the literary aid.

1039
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,920
Fountain of youth.

1040
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,920
Well, we follow what the daily borrowers go send.

1041
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,920
Taking legal doses of MTV.

1042
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,920
Downing into bedside kindness rate.

1043
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,920
Try to treat cancer when the fruit is cured.

1044
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,920
And waiting for the meal free.

1045
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,920
Your mental illness is a great match to the world.

1046
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,920
And we're even cut as easy as it turns around.

1047
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,920
Great match to the world.

1048
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,920
And we're never really sure.

1049
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,920
If we're up or down.

1050
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,920
We're on a dirt court out in space.

1051
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,920
We're without nobody to know.

1052
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,920
We'll stay still.

1053
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,920
If Jesus came back today.

1054
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,920
We'll be trying to book him all day.

1055
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,920
Hope we'll win the free show.

1056
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,920
We'll make the greatest and the greatest.

1057
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,920
We'll make the greatest and the greatest.

1058
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:32,920
We'll make the greatest and the greatest.

1059
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,920
We'll make the greatest and the greatest.

1060
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,920
We'll make the greatest and the greatest.

1061
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,920
We'll make the greatest and the greatest.

1062
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,920
We'll make the greatest and the greatest.

1063
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,920
We'll make the greatest and the greatest.

1064
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,920
We'll make the greatest and the greatest.

1065
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,920
We'll make the greatest and the greatest.

1066
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,920
Getting children older from our toning bags,

1067
00:49:54,920 --> 00:50:10,820
channeling, improving,

1068
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:15,920
earning a plane, and trying to figure out what the door is the same.

1069
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,920
We're in purple town

1070
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,920
We're on a different spot out in the place

1071
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,920
So we're stuck to where it's not snow

1072
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,920
But we don't know

1073
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,920
It's still changing the game back to the place

1074
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,920
They try to book it all

1075
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,920
But when we know

1076
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,920
Because this is the place

1077
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,920
This is the place

1078
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,920
This is the place

1079
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,920
This is the place

1080
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,920
This is the world

1081
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,920
This is the place

1082
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,920
This is the place

1083
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,920
This view

1084
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,920
This is the place

1085
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,920
That is the place

1086
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,920
We're going to play that.

1087
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,920

And we'll never make sure if we're up or down

1093
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,760
It's the night

1094
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,580
I think I'd actually be wearing high school school flags

I think I'd say screaming

Channel dance tonight.

1114
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:28,420
Oh man, hey at least we're awake, right, at least we see what's going on.

1115
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:34,100
And this October 14th thing, I'm pretty jazzed about that.

1116
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:40,340
You know, and I am way open to the possibility of extraterrestrials

1117
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:46,580
surfacing their ship for 3 24-hour periods, plainly visible to us Earthlings.

1118
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,900
To let us know that there's a way out, and they're going to help us.

1119
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,460
Hell, I'm open to that big time.

1120
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:01,860
Episode 787 of Daily Source Code, it's the Fubar Friday.

1121
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:10,020
You might have seen on curry.com earlier in the week, I put up a YouTube video of Adam Savage of

1122
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:17,860
Mythbusters fame. He was at Defcon, maybe. He was one of these hacker conferences.

1123
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,660
He was talking about an episode that we're going to do about the

1124
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:24,500
hackability of credit cards that include RFID chips.

1125
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:29,140
And in the video, he says, oh man, it's like Discovery Channel wouldn't let us do it.

1126
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,780
There was a big hassle, so that's never going to make the air.

1127
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:36,980
And now there's a retraction, as listed on the consumers, he says,

1128
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:41,780
you know, actually it wasn't the Discovery Channel was the producers of the show beyond

1129
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:47,940
productions who decided not to air the segment or the show.

1130
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:52,500
Now, I don't actually know if they created the entire show, I can't recall if he mentions that

1131
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,020
and there's a original video. I actually know what we could do. We could probably

1132
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:02,180
probably play this, let me see. I have my browser now tapped in.

1133
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,740
Oh, wait, oh, yeah, here it is. Let's look at the video.

1134
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:08,580
Let's listen to what he did with to Adam Savage said. This is the initial video where he said

1135
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:14,740
that they are testing things for yourself, not assuming that the man is taking a question from

1136
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,780
the audience. So, this is probably going to flow right into it.

1137
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:21,300
RFID. Now, I know that Discovery still have the earth.

1138
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,020
Are you taking a wrong? Do the RFID thing?

1139
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,460
Yeah. Why did you know?

1140
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:30,180
I'm sorry. I'm not here. It's just not going to happen.

1141
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,420
I tend to discover, here's what happens. Here's what happens.

1142
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,380
I'm not sure how much of the story I'm allowed to tell, but I'll tell you what I know.

1143
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:51,380
We were going to do RFID. And on several levels, we know how hackable, how reliable,

1144
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:56,500
how trackable, et cetera, et cetera. And one of our researchers called up Texas Instruments

1145
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:04,980
and they arranged a conference call between, I think, Torrey and the head producer over there

1146
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:10,580
for the other team with a walk of it. Right. So, it sounds like they were just prepping the

1147
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:16,660
prepping the episode. And that got pulled. Anyway, so he says it's a producer. And even though

1148
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:21,540
he really says the Discovery Channel said, no, there's a retraction on it. So, I can look at it and

1149
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:30,020
show notes. As the power, that's how it goes. And here's something folks in the UK, my fellow citizens,

1150
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:38,580
the councils in the UK. So, here we have the Guildford Council of the Town.

1151
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:48,260
Our recruiting citizen snoopers, citizens snoopers to report littered louts, dog followers, even

1152
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:54,900
people who failed to sort out their rubbish properly. The environmental volunteers will also be

1153
00:56:54,900 --> 00:57:02,980
responsible for encouraging neighbors to cut down on waste. Excuse me, I just have to admit some

1154
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:10,180
kind of gas after reading this. I don't care, yeah, I really don't care what the governments

1155
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:16,740
and councils, you know, what they want to do to restrict our freedom, but we cannot allow ourselves

1156
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:22,340
to fall into this one. We cannot be snooping on each other. In fact, we need to have signs that

1157
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:28,100
said that we can post in our windows at home that say, I'm not going to snoop on my freaking neighbor.

1158
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:33,780
No way. We should be snooping on the council. See what those guys are up to.

1159
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:43,140
This is just nuts. I haven't seen an advertising campaign yet, but the minute I do, I'm sure we're

1160
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:51,540
going to have to, you know, photoshop it and create an anti campaign. The Liberal Democrat

1161
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:55,460
controlled council denied the volunteers will be asked to spy on their neighbors. No, no,

1162
00:57:55,460 --> 00:58:00,500
these are all people who care about the environment and they will be ambassadors for their area.

1163
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:06,340
A spokesman said, they'll be there to report graffiti abandoned vehicles and local vandalism,

1164
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:11,460
not to report another individuals. Oh, no. The volunteers will be trained on the council's

1165
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:16,100
waist and recycling policies because that's what all those kids are doing. You know, they're recycling

1166
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:23,220
incorrectly. Those vagrant kids bullshit. Hey, don't fall for this trap. That's really, that's like

1167
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:29,540
really fucking bad news. We shouldn't be doing this. Don't spy on your neighbor. It's just not a good

1168
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:35,540
policy. All right. I want to pop back across the ocean to the Republican National Convention

1169
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:41,060
rage against the machine had a, an anti, really an anti war concert they put on.

1170
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:47,620
At a certain point, officials pulled the plug, pulled the power. And these guys just walked out into

1171
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:53,620
the audience and they started talking to the audience and actually, I want you to listen to this.

1172
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:57,380
And then they actually started doing accapella version of one of their songs.

1173
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:05,140
It is never, never advocated violence. We've always advocated a direct opposition to

1174
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:11,620
unjust wars, like the one started by John McCain and the Republicans and Bush and all of them.

1175
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:15,620
That's why we're here today. Stay in peace, all over the world.

1176
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:30,660
Now, in order that peaceful opposition, we wish that the police and the state here in Minneapolis

1177
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:39,540
would do the same thing. It's like thousands of people here. They're just standing in front of the

1178
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:47,380
stage yelling. The reality is, we're just forming these decisions from Los Angeles who've used

1179
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:53,540
our voices and our talent and our musicianship and our words to stand up against these unjust

1180
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:58,260
policies and why the fuck are these cops all afraid of us? Are they afraid of us?

1181
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:07,300
No, no, no, no. They're not afraid of the musicians. They're afraid of you.

1182
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,340
So let's tell you what? This is good stuff.

1183
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:27,700
These guys rock, man. The more I learn about rage against the machine, the more I'm real.

1184
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:38,260
like in their shit. So now, um, so it's, you know, they're just a crowd. They've got like one body guard and the crowd is just, you know, oh, oh, now they've got a megaphone. This is cool.

1185
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:43,060
Everybody needs a megaphone to do an acupella.

1186
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:46,060
They forgot.

1187
01:00:55,060 --> 01:01:08,580
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, oh Ben, oh Bangon, baby, oh Bangon, baby, oh, baby, oh Bangon, baby, oh, Bangon, hey Bangon, oh Bangon, PDA, oh Bangon, oh Bangon,

1188
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,580
This is all through the megaphone.

1189
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,580
Mr. the crowd man are going nuts.

1190
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,580
We now weed the lab.

1191
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:43,580
It is all over.

1192
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,580
My money is out.

1193
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:49,580
So remember Joe.

1194
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,580
Pick you up.

1195
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,580
This door.

1196
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:53,580
warning of your car.

1197
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,580
Let the ball stop.

1198
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:59,580
Follow the sagt over.

1199
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:04,580
It will shake.

1200
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:07,580
It begins hit not higher.

1201
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:37,580

1203
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:49,380
Throw out the feet from above the feet

1204
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:52,380
Pick up the trick that's called into your heart

1205
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,380
Way down your family

1206
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:59,380

Go away, guard at Jules Mr. Bill

1215
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:41,380
They also come to us

1216
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:43,380
Check out the problem

1217
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:44,380

01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,100
It's Friday!

1243
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:40,420
I'm a day Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, full about Friday, I have a final fun phone

1244
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:41,420
to read.

1245
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:42,420
Yeah!

1246
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:48,460
That was raved against the machine and bulls on parade, start off at Capella there.

1247
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:55,220
The R&C anti-war concert and move right on into the full blown track here on the

1248
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:59,780
787, your full-buyer fro-buyer friday edition of the source code.

1249
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:04,060
Looking forward to a nice weekend of course so weekends are holy these days.

1250
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:08,180
You need to chill out, take some time, it's going to be a wet one.

1251
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:13,300
Anyway, final thought of the week, well, you know what, we've obviously got our eye on

1252
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:17,180
the ball, don't be misled.

1253
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:22,420
This is what it's all about, there is truly a war going on for your mind if anything.

1254
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:26,380
So you got to take clear headed, always question what you're reading but make sure you're

1255
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:28,500
read a lot and help each other out.

1256
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:33,220
These aggregation sites are fantastic like drop.io where you really get a lot of the news

1257
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,060
that you just don't see in the headlines.

1258
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:40,340
Keep watching that stuff and stay in touch with the earth and each other.

1259
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:45,140
You know, maybe sometime during the weekend you'll just chill out, we'll take a couple

1260
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:50,460
of minutes, plant your feet firmly on the ground.

1261
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:55,140
This by the way is done best if you're actually on the ground floor as in level with the

1262
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:56,140
earth.

1263
01:06:56,140 --> 01:07:02,060
And just imagine your your feet shooting root deep into the earth's core and feel of

1264
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:08,300
vibrations, feel your own vibrations as they should start to move to a higher cycle.

1265
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:11,940
And let that feeling come over you feel how it's starting to give you pins and needles

1266
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:17,900
in your ankles and up through your calves and through your thighs and through your pelvis.

1267
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:23,660
Your shockers are opening up and you too will feel at ease and at peace with the world

1268
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:29,860
because no matter what we think we can do in our arrogant nature to mother nature, she's

1269
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:31,340
always going to win.

1270
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:34,100
So we might as well take care of her and be in touch with her so we can feel what's

1271
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,100
coming next.

1272
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:44,980
Let's put it that way, that'll be the final thought of the week.

1273
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:49,900
And of course we'll be the final thought of the week goes one final song.

1274
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,540
All of these from the drop you can find them at drop.io slash daily source code if you're

1275
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:56,580
looking for them.

1276
01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:01,460
This one kind of starts to rock out but gets into it slowly, I think you'll like it.

1277
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:07,860
United abominations on the football friday edition of the Charlie.

1278
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:16,460
With that leap and a bigger threat, they will lose you when one way or another will

1279
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:17,460
be so happy.

1280
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:20,460
Where we are, it doesn't go the worse.

1281
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:25,860
And you win it right, you can't be any more art than you are right now.

1282
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:27,860
The key to end is undone.

1283
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:31,860
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun.

1284
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:33,860
The bread is real, the look is key.

1285
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:34,860
It's key to end.

1286
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:38,860
Don't tell me the truth, I don't like what they've done.

1287
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:49,860
It's made that time, it's a united abomination.

1288
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:55,860
With a gathering agent, the decision to end.

1289
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,860
These are secret passages.

1290
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,860
It'll take you side, be it to one new.

1291
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,860
The feeling's in our hands.

1292
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:07,860
You made very the bodies.

1293
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:12,860
When you can't bear with the ties, won't it fall still?

1294
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:14,860
That feeling like ever art.

1295
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:15,860
No, not me.

1296
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,860
Like what they've lost forever.

1297
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:24,860
Think you win it right, can't be any more art than you are right now.

1298
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,860
The end is undone.

1299
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:29,860
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun.

1300
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:33,860
The bread is real, the look is key to end.

1301
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:37,860
Don't tell me the truth, I don't like what they've done.

1302
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:41,860
It's made that time, it's a united abomination.

1303
