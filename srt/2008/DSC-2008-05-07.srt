1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
It is my desire if not my duty to try to talk to your journeymen with some candor about

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,240
what is happening to radio and television.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,080
Our history will be what we make of it.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,920
And if there are any historians about 50 or 100 years from now, and there should be preserved

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,400
the kinoscopes of one week of all three networks, they will find recorded in black and

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,520
white and in color.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,720
Evidence of decadence, escapism, and insulation from the realities of the world in which

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,480
we live.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,960
We are currently wealthy, fat, comfortable, and complacent.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,760
We have a built-in allergy to unpleasant or disturbing information.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,720
Our mass media reflect this, but unless we get up off our fats or pluses and recognize

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:51,400
that television in the main is being used to distract, delude, amuse, and insulators.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,240
Then television and those who finance it, those who look at it, and those who work

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,240
at it.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,240
I see a totally different picture to light.

16
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:36,880
I can't stand it, I know you're bleeding, I'm a sin of strength, this one I can't stand

17
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,920
working with, I've been here, because the crystal ball ain't so crisp and clear, so

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,560
warm and simple, and one the one, I've got this fucking boy in my side, oh my God, it's

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:02:19,560
all right, I'm telling you all the same, it's all right, you're new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new

20
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:49,560
new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new small, new, new, new year, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new,裝 for our

21
00:02:49,560 --> 00:03:16,400
You know, I think it's exactly what the Beastie boys need, you know, a little more

22
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:26,280
ability in there, sabotaging the cooks, the cooks match with the Beastie boys, steady source

23
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,720
code episode number 755 coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Gulford, we're

24
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,320
here in the curry manner up in the attic everybody how you doing another beauty full day, not

25
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,820
a cloud, it's all the nines cavo k, for those of you just turning into the show, that means

26
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:50,860
that all the nines is super visibility 10 kilometers and cavo k ceiling and visibility

27
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,860
okay.

28
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,580
Hey, I've got most of the, most of the hum out of the, out of the signal, out of the processing,

29
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,900
you know, yesterday I discovered by some chance that the DVI connector to my monitor is,

30
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,780
is the cause actually of a whole bunch of troubles, giving enormous static and I'm trying

31
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,500
to figure out how to get away from that, and a couple of different suggestions came in,

32
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,580
I really like this one that I got from Mike Ackels, just try clipping a ferrite ring to

33
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:25,620
the lead, these can be most bought at most radio-shack type stores, maplens in the UK ferrite

34
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,620
ring.

35
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,060
I've seen those, it's one of those kind of like the, you know, the big plastic bump that

36
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,420
kind of clamps over the wire, that's crazy man, it's not even touching the wires, it's

37
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,060
just around it and that should reduce it, so I'll go out later, if I don't go out

38
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,100
today, I'm going to go out early tomorrow morning, go to the, to the music store, see if

39
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,620
they have that there, otherwise I'll have to find myself a maplens pretty quickly, really

40
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:52,940
pissed off about this, I cannot believe that this is happening in our country, that would

41
00:04:52,940 --> 00:05:01,500
be the United States that in this case, in an announcement, check this out, that puts troops

42
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,380
in their families in the middle of a political dispute, a Pentagon spokesman said yesterday,

43
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:13,100
this was Tuesday, the army will not be able to pay soldiers after June 15th unless Congress

44
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:21,660
approves an emergency war funding bill, they, they're not going to be able to make payroll

45
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:28,060
to our boys and girls, our men and women sitting in the freaking desert, and now the, and

46
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,700
you look, first of all, of course they're going to be able to make payroll because the money

47
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,660
will come from somewhere, we just print some up, but to turn them into such a political

48
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,500
tool, it's just about the worst thing I can imagine, and I am, I'm personally just outraged

49
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:49,380
by this, and so now, the Bush administration is using this, as I said, as a political

50
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:59,220
tool, oh, please, hold on, so go away, don't call me now, I can't deal with you, sorry,

51
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,260
I didn't have the phone near me, so I had to get up and silence it. Anyway, back to this,

52
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,620
so army payroll accounts are running dry faster than expected, if Congress does not act

53
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,780
by May 26, quote, will have to come back to them and ask them for permission to reprogram

54
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,940
money, check this out, reprogram money, so that we can take money from some of the other services,

55
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,220
Navy, Air Force, and use those payroll dollars to pay the army, does anyone else see how

56
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,820
fucked up this is and how incredibly wrong this is, I mean, how could we ever get to this spot?

57
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,140
All right, Congress, it's really down to you, as far as I'm concerned, you're the guys

58
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,940
they're going to have to show some backbone and come up with a solution, what's it going to

59
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:51,060
come down to? What is it going to be at the end of the day? I'm, I'm flabbergasted, absolutely

60
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:58,180
flabbergasted by this, flabbergasted, gobsmacked, that's the one. Oh, there's some other horrible

61
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:05,060
stuff I gotta tell you about, but, but everything that came in yesterday, email, voicemail, comments,

62
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,220
it's about the news, actually I'm going to, why don't I just roll this comment you'll hear about it,

63
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,740
because I love it when I'm right. Hey, I don't this is Richard and Claygate,

64
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,500
and that you'd like to be proved right of now and again, so here's another chance, and also time

65
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,060
for me to eat a slice of humble pie. The report I had today from Detective Chief Inspector,

66
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,900
meet Neville, the net police officer in charge of, I didn't let me help one of these,

67
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,700
the visual images, identifications, and detections office, that's called Unyard,

68
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,980
because rather disappointing that perhaps unsurprising verdict is that massive investment in CCTV cameras

69
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,860
to prevent crime in the UK has failed to have a significant impact despite billions of pounds

70
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:50,660
spent on the new technology. Ah, oh my goodness, you don't say. So wait a minute, you're going

71
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:57,460
to tell me that all of those cameras are actually not solving crime, millions of cameras,

72
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:06,020
billions of pounds invested, not actually solving crime. Uncobsmacked again. I need 3% of

73
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,180
street rubber President London was sold, using CCTV images, despite the fact that Britain has

74
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,060
more security cameras than any other country in Europe. And can you guess what a DCI naval

75
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,500
plans to do about this? Oh yes, I had more control over us to try and justify the massive spending.

76
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,500
He wants to build a new database of images, which is expected to be a technology developed

77
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,380
by the sports advertising industry to track them out into face offenders, put images of suspects

78
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,140
in muttings, rape, and robbery cases out on the internet for the next month, that's suspects.

79
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:39,220
And above the national CCTV database, incorporating pictures of computer defenders as well as unidentified

80
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,260
suspects. The plans for this have been drawn up, but on hold, well, that technology required to

81
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,740
carry out automators searches is refined. As much more on the card games website, but I thought

82
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:55,460
you'd appreciate this. Yeah, for now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, ain't that interesting.

83
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,860
Of course, I know exactly what they're going to do now. So now they're saying,

84
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,980
we're going to build a database, which I believe is built on sports database technology,

85
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:12,180
where you want to find a certain player, so it'll be by characteristics, such as what he's

86
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:18,980
wearing. I think actually, I think those image recognition technologies are helped tremendously by

87
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,780
the fact that the players have numbers on their chest and on their back. But they're going to use

88
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:30,100
this to be able to track people doing bad things. That could be you. That could be me as well.

89
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,260
And I guess build up. I just, it sounds like shit. It sounds like an incredible pie in this guy.

90
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:42,020
Good luck building that. In the meantime, you've wasted billions of pounds of our money of

91
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:48,020
taxpayers money. And it's not doing anything. I believe the actual number is that all this money

92
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:56,100
has resulted in solving 3% of all of Britain's crimes. 3% think of all the money. Why

93
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,900
should put some more cops on the street, dude? And now I'm reading all these stories about this. This

94
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,140
is a big thing. Everyone's talking about this and everyone's really laughing about it because

95
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:11,220
it's just not doing anything. So you have choices here. You can, yeah, you can store it all in a

96
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:17,620
database. That's another billion-dollar billion-pound project to bring in Oracle and Microsoft and

97
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:23,220
other consultancies. And they'll all rip you off. It'll never result in anything. You could, of

98
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,180
course, alternatively open it up. Connect all these cameras to the internet. That will be an

99
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,660
interesting experiment. It would certainly be something novel. So we all could watch each other.

100
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:45,780
And thirdly, I don't think there is third option, actually. We sell the entire kitten

101
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:51,620
caboodle to Mark Burnett and turn Britain into a worldwide reality show. Something like that.

102
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,380
I'm sure it's going to be used to track down abusers of cannabis. Actually, for some reason,

103
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:08,020
I lost the page. I had it all cut up. I told you that here in the UK, Gordon Brown has said,

104
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,900
well, or at least the administration of the Labor Parliament has said,

105
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:18,180
well, you know, we're going to reclassify cannabis. We're going to turn it back into a

106
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,300
class B drug. Here it is. I've got it. BBC News. I'll put a link in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

107
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,740
Jackie Smith, who is the home secretary, says, because of increased strength of some types of cannabis,

108
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:34,820
she wanted to reverse 20 blares 2004 downgrading of the drug to class C. It has to go back to class B.

109
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:42,500
And there's lies in here. Lies lies lies lies lies. Let's see. Miss Smith said

110
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,660
that the new skunk varieties, skunk varieties, which has been around for 30 years,

111
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:58,420
accounted for 80% of the cannabis seized on the streets and here this comes. And the drug was nearly

112
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,180
three times stronger than in 1995. Oh, could you please quantify that for me, Miss Smith,

113
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,540
qualify? And if so, tell me where to get some. Hell is wrong with you.

114
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:16,020
A little side box here on the BBC web page. Skunk. So called because it has a very strong smell.

115
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:22,660
I think cannabis is always smelled pretty strong. Oh, another factoid from your BBC three times

116
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:28,500
stronger than other types of cannabis. It's a lie. Quantify it. Come on. How do you can't even

117
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:34,980
measure it? Oh, contains much higher levels of the active ingredient, touch a hydro cannabinol

118
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:41,460
THC. Now accounts for between 70 and 80% of samples seized by police and six years ago,

119
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:47,460
it only accounted for 15% of the samples. Yeah, it's good herb, man. So anyway, let me just

120
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:53,380
tell you about these classes. That is a nice little box they put here. So class C,

121
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:03,220
which includes currently cannabis, tranquilizers, some painkillers, Gamahydroxybutyrate,

122
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:10,900
which is known as GHB or the date rape drug, the date rape drug is in class C. That's the thing

123
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:17,620
that you need to put in class A and ketamine, which I've never tried either, but I think that's

124
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,820
what they call special K essentially. It's a horse tranquilizer too. I've seen people K it out.

125
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:31,860
That's not okay. Cannabis has no business in that with these other, I think horrible drugs.

126
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:38,100
Possession of class C drugs can get you up to two years in prison or an unlimited fine or both.

127
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:44,580
Oops, an unlimited fine. And dealing can get you up to 14 years in prison or an unlimited fine

128
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,980
or both. Now class B, which is where cannabis is moving towards, that's where we find end

129
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:55,060
fedemins, things like riddle in and full codine, I have no idea what that is.

130
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,660
Seems like that seems more like class C stuff to me. If you want to go shoot up with

131
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:07,300
you know, steroids and shit, that can get you up to five years in prison or an unlimited

132
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:14,500
fine or both. Dealing is the same 14 years class A is where we find X to C, LSD, heroin, cocaine,

133
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:21,380
crack, magic, rub mush, mushrooms, and injected end fedemins. Possession up to seven years in prison

134
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,900
or an unlimited fine or both. Dealing up to life. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Well, I agree there.

135
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,340
But I don't know. And this doesn't seem like they've classified this properly. And of course,

136
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:41,140
the travesty is let me see if I can find it. The reports as a report that came out that was

137
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:46,500
actually commissioned by Gordon Brown, the evidence suggested a probable but weak casual link

138
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,460
between psychotic illness, including schizophrenia and cannabis use. However, in the population

139
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,460
as a whole, it played only a modest role in the development of these conditions. Council

140
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,020
chairman sir Michael Rawlings told BBC Radio's for World One, the strength of things like

141
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,020
scunk hasn't really changed very much over the last few years, but it's now more widely used.

142
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:09,780
The question of potency is a very complex area. Absolutely. This is just, just pisses me off.

143
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:18,820
Well, we'll just have to go with the flow, I guess. Let me see Jack calls in

144
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:25,140
some about the iPhones. Hey, Adam, it's Jack. I thought I'd update you with some area,

145
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:30,500
something within my area of savant expertise. And that being the iPhone, I heard you mentioned,

146
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:37,220
and I don't know, DSC, 1051 or two or something like that. You know, you're waiting for the

147
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:43,060
3G iPhone. And I can't report that at least in the area that I live on the beautiful sunny

148
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:49,220
West Side of Florida, the Apple Store that's nearby is completely out of iPhones.

149
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,900
Yeah, I've heard these reports. I've been reading them around that, and that's of course,

150
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,420
everyone, you know, that's fueling the speculation that the 3G iPhone is on the way. I think

151
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,060
Apple actually said that the 3G iPhone is on the way. And there's been some pictures that

152
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,780
popped up here and there. But of course, the first thing you want to do is get rid of all the

153
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:09,780
old stocks. So I think Jack has an inside line to probably an AT&T store, and that's what

154
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:16,820
it's basing is knowledge on, which is a telling thing. Here at the great Death Star Wireless

155
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:22,340
Communications Store where I work, we're kind of running low. We still have some, but they seem

156
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:27,860
to be being replenished. Hey, man, you run a low. You got some supply, baby. At a slower pace.

157
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,700
Yeah, I, I, when I was in Los Angeles, I had a couple hours to kill on Saturday before I had

158
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:39,540
to take my flight home. And I walked to an AT&T store, and I looked at the iPhones and I held

159
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,540
them in my hand. And I'm like, you know, I wouldn't mind just having one just until the next one

160
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,500
comes out. And it was really difficult. And that, you know, of course, they're already a hundred bucks

161
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,180
cheaper than they were initially worth to several hundred dollars cheaper. I resisted the urge, though.

162
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:58,180
And so it's probably gonna be Harrison. And, um, but you, man, seven and a half hours not being

163
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:05,460
a lot enough continuous usage time. Well, let me just quantify that because, um, I don't believe

164
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:11,620
cell phone manufacturers really are honest about how long their devices last on a single battery

165
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:18,020
charge. I've never, and actually the Nokia E61, I really gets me two full days of full blast,

166
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,660
whatever I need to do. And of course, I'm not sitting there doing seven hours worth of phone calls,

167
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,380
but yeah, I have phone calls that last an hour or two hours. Absolutely, conference calls all the time.

168
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,820
And I want to do it on a mobile so I can walk around. And that will pretty much just start to

169
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:40,420
delete the iPhone to add to that, um, that I have the Wi-Fi on and it's either searching or connected.

170
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,620
It, uh, it just, it can't hack it, dude. And, you know, of course, the minute you use the browser,

171
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,260
the backlight comes on, all the stuff that drains the battery. So, I really need a much longer

172
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,780
charge. I need something like the E61 eye. That really completes my day. On the phone, you're free,

173
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,380
can I? I mean, yeah, four hours. I was just getting used to talk time as a bad as long as

174
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,940
most cell phones last seven hours on the internet, getting email, making phone calls,

175
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:11,700
watching video is a long time. And, uh, by a car charger, you know? That's exactly what I

176
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,700
don't want by a car charge. That's what I see. Everyone with an iPhone has got a freaking car

177
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,860
charger. Oh, let me just plug in my iPhone because, you know, it's running all empty again.

178
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:25,780
By a battery pack. Yeah. Oh, by a battery pack. Let me see, uh, non exchangeable,

179
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:31,780
can't put a new one in the iPhone. The 3G one isn't going to last any longer, I wouldn't think.

180
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:37,220
Well, that would be a huge mistake. That would be a big mistake if the 3G phone was not going

181
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:43,380
to last any longer than the current iPhone. Um, but hey, that's just my little point of view.

182
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,700
And I had something else that I was going to mention, but now I can't really recall what it is.

183
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,900
It's the skunk man. Oh, yeah. You set up awesome. Yeah, up with the little blanky light

184
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:59,700
controllers, uh, and everything, but doesn't that with the MacBook Pro and the two controllers

185
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:06,340
and the software, cause in the microphone, cause like three grand? Just asking.

186
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:13,220
Have your mean great hair. Yeah, man. Well, what did, no, actually no, the most expensive piece

187
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,740
is able to live, which I'm using. That is about a $400 package. But damn is that good. From

188
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:24,740
Germany, I might add, then I have a sound bite, which I think is like, um, 30 bucks.

189
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,660
And I think I got an, uh, you can get more racks. I use that for kind of like a cartridge

190
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:35,940
jingle rack thingy, um, maybe 70 bucks. And then, uh, a couple hundred bucks for the fader

191
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,140
fox fader. Another fine German invention, couple hundred bucks for the winky blinky light. So what

192
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:47,220
are we at? Yeah. Yeah, you're right. It's expensive. Hey, cast blaster. Go check that out. 50 bucks

193
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,820
for your windows machine. It does everything you need right in right out of the box cast blaster.com.

194
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,260
As speaking of people wanting to get into, uh, into this audio stuff on the internet,

195
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:04,980
he's a radio guy who's trying it in. Hey, Adam, this is Brian Seabers from Appleton,

196
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:12,260
Wisconsin, listening to Daily Source code, uh, the iPod made in China. Yo, it's okay. Um,

197
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,260
I'm actually doing something a little bit different. Trying to go off top of a little bit. I'm, uh,

198
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:21,540
I've been following you since your MTV days, I'm 30. So, you know, I was, I was a young and

199
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,180
when you started, but I knew, I knew a bunch of other jack and the long here, but good, um,

200
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:31,620
love your hair. Um, and, uh, you know, I actually have a radio background. I went to school for radio.

201
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,660
Uh, tell me you went to the Connecticut School of Broadcasting. I love it. And I worked in radio

202
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,660
outside of college and all throughout college. And until recently, actually, I was doing a program

203
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,820
director morning show that afternoon show at an AM station, uh, which was interesting to say

204
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,220
the least, and I'm out of radio now, um, because hey, guess what, they don't pay shit. Did you know

205
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:57,220
that? Yeah. Oh, yes, I've heard. That's a big, uh, that's the thing a lot of people don't know about

206
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,580
radio. Yeah, particularly United States. It is, without a doubt, the lowest wrong of the show

207
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:09,380
is latter. Um, yeah, yet some of the biggest egos on the show is latter. And it's, it's corporate,

208
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,940
just like everything else in America is becoming, but besides the point, I'm wondering about this

209
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,180
whole podcasting thing. Do you think this is really the way of the future? Do you think that

210
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:23,140
radio will go away and everyone will just get podcasts? And do you think I can get in on it before

211
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,340
it's too late? Well, first of all, dude, there's always time to get in on it. Just start. That's what

212
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:33,940
I always tell everybody. Um, and, um, and, you know, and John C. to work, and I proved it just

213
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,900
just, you know, well, actually it's been almost, uh, it's been almost six months now. We do a

214
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:44,420
weekly show. We started from zero. Uh, didn't really even promote it that much in the beginning,

215
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,580
and it just took off like wildfire, you know, in that case, it's all about the content.

216
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,660
Well, I think we're referring to as the infrastructure. Well, there's two parts to it. One is the,

217
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:59,380
the actual physical infrastructure distribution of transmitters. Primarily, two people who have

218
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,340
radios in their cars. That's still a pretty big market. Yes, it's changing. Yes, we're

219
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:09,460
getting seeing more cars, particularly in the United States that include, uh, satellite radio receivers,

220
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:17,940
like Sirius or XM, or soon to be, of course, the same thing. Um, I, uh, I don't see that changing

221
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,620
very, very quickly. That's still going to take another 10 years, I think, before we really see a

222
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:26,020
big proliferation of that in cars. And by then, who knows if we're still driving, if we can actually

223
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:31,620
move anywhere in our cars. So that's part one. Of course, this, uh, a synchronous distribution

224
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:37,620
through podcasts, uh, really downloading and taking it with you is, uh, is a whole new market,

225
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,620
a market that was not being fulfilled, you know, a market that, uh, would not listen to radio

226
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:46,020
necessarily in the train in the bus, uh, in the subway on their way to work, uh, or on their

227
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:52,900
bicycle, etc. Um, so I think where it's going is, well, wait, there's one other piece of the

228
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,940
infrastructure that mainstream radio has, which is the advertising infrastructure. Okay, so their

229
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:03,940
ad units are known to the advertising industry, uh, their measurements are known. Hey, by the way,

230
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,180
what's up with the association of downloadable media? You know, they came out with this report that

231
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,820
we were all waiting for that was going to be perfect to explain to advertisers how downloadable

232
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:18,900
media works and how it's counted. What a piece, what a crock that was, huh? Well, a big disappointment.

233
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,940
I'm like, well, where's, where's something new? You know, they, all the, well, there's

234
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:30,020
server logs and a shut up. So that's the biggest problem is how do we get the money flowing?

235
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:35,460
That's the biggest challenge in general with, with content on the internet is how is it measured?

236
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,340
What ad units do you have? How do I measure my return on the investment as an advertiser?

237
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,340
Because that's pretty much the only business model that's there right now is advertising. Yeah,

238
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,980
sure. Um, if you have something specialist, I am sure you can get lots of people to pay you for.

239
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,980
I'm in fact going to play something from the kid from Brooklyn a little bit. I pay, I pay for

240
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,340
for his videos 20, uh, 20 bucks a year or some or $2 a month. I don't know what it doesn't matter.

241
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:02,900
I love him. I think he's funny and I can afford it so that that kind of works. I don't know if he's

242
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:08,420
making a living off of it. So yes, the answer is yes, start starting now, start quick, get in the game.

243
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,660
I heard you talking about mixing boards and things like that and the hundreds of thousand dollars

244
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,660
you must be spending. I'm just going to get a for that. But what are you, if that's something

245
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,100
that's at all feasible? If it's something that I should really look into because, you know, I got the

246
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,980
gift. I'm selling insurance now, which I'm sure will make a lot of your audience members cringe,

247
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,300
but um, and it's better money and for a lot less trust. You know, I get that gift here.

248
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:34,180
Here are my radio voice. Everyone's in a while. What are your thoughts on that work?

249
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,100
Um, I, I guess I love your hair. I'm, I'm newer to the show. So I don't know all these things

250
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,740
mean and I don't know at no home on me. And when I'm, I'm hoping that's not a whole

251
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,740
public. You know, starting as a home of public kind of dude, but I do hope you win. And I'm a,

252
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,860
I'm at least five times a week. I used to spend when the lady is working. You know what I'm saying?

253
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,260
No. All right. Well, we'll talk with you soon, man. Love you, bye. All right. So I should explain

254
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:59,300
a couple things here. For those of you just turning in tuning into this show. First of all,

255
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:04,020
um, this is a whole legacy thing. It's, say, the phrase is actually, I love you, man, no

256
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,820
home. That is the whole phrase has nothing to do with homeophobia. It's something I picked up

257
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:15,060
from Tony Price, Costas World, uh, Black America, uh, men say this to each other. And it's just kind of

258
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:21,300
stock. I love you, man. No home. It doesn't mean anything more anything less. It's, uh, it's a

259
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:28,420
typical American male macho thing. Which is just stock and hasn't gone away. Regarding the five times

260
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,660
a week, uh, I just got to bring this up again. I'm now posting it in the show notes. This is the, uh,

261
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:39,780
from the news report that, uh, purported that, uh, men who masturbated at least five times a week

262
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:49,060
have a much lower risk of, um, developing prostate cancer. So, uh, we track our prostate cancer

263
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,620
prevention quotient here on the show. I'm currently at two for the week. I am behind because I've

264
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:59,620
got to hit my, my number of five. So, uh, I'll keep you up the date. Don't worry. And hope to hear

265
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:04,660
you soon. I was some kind of show buddy. Thanks. Call it in. Hi Adam. Uh, this is Janet from New York

266
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:12,420
calling to explain what the problem with nuclear fission is. Um, we made a mistake with fossil fuels

267
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:17,700
by burning them and not worrying about what the waste product was CO2. We just kept dumping

268
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,260
CO2 and air without worrying about the effect. And we'll only hold now we have to worry about

269
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:29,460
global warming. Okay. This is, uh, about my curiosity towards nuclear energy. Uh, of course, we know

270
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:36,340
that it burns clean, uh, but it does leave a waste product. And, uh, that is the main problem.

271
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:41,060
I think it's something that is solvable. Uh, but I'm very interested in it. You know, and by the

272
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:46,180
way, let's just agree not to say global warming. Can we just say climate change? Okay. Uh, because

273
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:52,820
even though I'm skeptical if CO2 emissions actually as reported by the IPPC, which is also

274
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:58,980
disputable. If, um, if these carbon emissions actually do cause global climate change, I will say that

275
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:04,260
the reports now are, oh, as a part of the global climate change, temperatures are actually going to go

276
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:09,140
down for the next 10 years. And then, of course, we're all going to fry to death. Um, that problem

277
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:16,980
plus obviously is the 10 in front of our oil. So now we'll, uh, depend on nuclear power and just because

278
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:22,820
the product's fission are not green ooze doesn't mean that, um, we don't have to worry about them.

279
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:29,460
Um, when you split atoms, um, in fission, you're making way more radioactivity than it's just

280
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,660
before. Uh, and the, and the products may be attract the blocks of metal, but they're mixtures

281
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:41,700
of highly radioactive materials that we don't have a fucking clue what to do with. Okay. So we've established

282
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,580
a couple of things. It's very important that you understand that nuclear waste is not green ooze

283
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:54,820
that, uh, you know, like you might find in doom or, uh, or some other, uh, uh, you know, game where

284
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,140
you have nuclear vats hanging around. That is, that is, of course, the image that you're supposed

285
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:05,140
to have, but it's not that way. They are stackable blocks kind of like, uh, kind of like Lincoln logs,

286
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:14,900
you know. Now, um, I do not believe they by themselves are dangerous. I'd have to get, uh, uh,

287
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:22,020
nuclear rod in on the game here. But anyway, uh, it is stackable, uh, and disposable. Uh, but of course,

288
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,740
we don't actually know what the long-term effects of that are. And, uh, but we can measure radiation.

289
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,460
So if it's a meeting radiation, we will know that. And obviously, no one wants to be near that. So

290
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,380
um, what I'm kind of pleased to hear is that no one is saying it's dangerous.

291
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,180
And of course, there's a whole argument for that, you know, a terrorist attack on a nuclear

292
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,260
plant. And let's et cetera, et cetera, slamming a plane into a nuclear plant. Well, we have a

293
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,900
couple of them already. It hasn't happened yet. And, uh, you got to do something. Can't live in constant

294
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,260
fear. Um, but the waste is an issue. I agree. We've got to figure that one out. Um, the American

295
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:01,620
plan to storm a nuclear mountain is not working because a nuclear mountain doesn't want it. So

296
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:06,820
I would say that maybe a decision is a great choice of energy, but until we figure out what to do

297
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:11,140
with the waste products, we shouldn't be making any more of those attractive metal boxes.

298
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:16,740
Okay. I got an idea. I, uh, it just came to me. Let's put that on the moon.

299
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,940
And this also solves the other problem of giving a nuclear power, a new name. We'll call it moon juice,

300
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:32,900
moon juice, moon power powered by the moon. I love it. That should be totally possible. We should be

301
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:38,260
able to, uh, you know, we'll look at these shuttles are going up all the time, deploying a

302
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,860
billions of dollars worth of satellite equipment. You know, it takes some shit up that we were on the

303
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,420
moon, right? We were actually landed there, right? We actually know how to get back there, right?

304
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:51,060
And that's not going on there, but that's shit on the moon. That's out of our way.

305
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:58,580
Make it make that the Death Star and call it moon juice. Nice, friendly moon juice, powering your

306
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:04,740
life. Your life powered by moon juice. Uh, the other problem is the source. And I, I actually

307
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,620
know less about this, but my understanding is that much of the uranium in the world comes from

308
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:15,380
places like South Africa. So, to trade dependence on the Middle East for dependence on South Africa,

309
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:19,780
it's not exactly great trade. I think that's a fantastic trade. Are you kidding me?

310
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:29,940
Go look at the Middle East. Are they loaded? Do they have tons of money? Yeah. Boy, that could

311
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,060
finally give Africa its props. You're right, the yellow cake or whatever. I guess it does

312
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:40,820
mainly come from from Africa. You don't, you need a lot less than the other natural resources.

313
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,300
And by the way, thank you, Mother Earth, for giving us the basic building blocks of our moon

314
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:50,820
juice. That's nice to know. So, um, until we figure out what we can do with nuclear waste,

315
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:56,340
I don't think we should be performing any more fusion. Anyway, love is show Adam, love you,

316
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:16,020
I'll say it twice a week. That's not enough for your prostate cancer prevention quotient. Of course,

317
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:21,780
this is not really an issue you might run into. However, with you calling back in from time to time,

318
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:27,860
giving me your quotient, that will raise mine for sure, because that's hot just thinking about it.

319
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:33,860
Hello Adam Curry, you from the Netherlands, South Guy Ups. Hey, listen, we have an echo today.

320
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,620
Everything going great. This is when I first heard this. I'm like, what is you talking about

321
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:45,220
an echo? He's referring to his wife, South Guy Ups wife, they're pregnant, they're having a kid,

322
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:52,180
they had an echo, it lives. It's a little mini-sills guy or it's a sales bill. We don't know yet.

323
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:58,420
Everything, very healthy, everything, looking very good. We made it the following decision. You know,

324
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:05,620
once you get a baby, everybody brings along gifts. And most of the time, it's like

325
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:12,100
teddy bears or stupid Chinese created gifts. All these gifts, all the doors,

326
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,100
most of the time are created in China. So my wife and I today made the decision

327
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:22,420
instead of having people bring a gift from China, make a donation,

328
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:30,100
to a charity that will try to find out right now. So we don't buy $3 or $3 a year

329
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:36,660
of gifts produced in China. No, we use the money and we do some good with it. That's all.

330
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:45,780
See you later. All right, sales guy, you, everybody. Yeah, man. I don't know. I don't know.

331
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,420
Now, make sure you kid get some toys. I mean, you don't want to totally

332
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:57,380
deprive the little sales, sales weasel. I got more sales weasel stuff coming up for you.

333
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,820
I really, oh, man, there's something weird today. I don't know if it's just, is it my ears or

334
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,900
fuck, and let me play a song and I'll figure this out. Be right back with you.

335
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:40,980
I don't know. People are all around you. We're just in my eyes. I don't want it to be

336
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:49,060
leave you. The lies that I could see through, but I never got between you. I'm ghosting

337
00:33:49,060 --> 00:34:00,580
your mind. The other ghosts in your mind. It's that you're right, that you're

338
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:12,180
always. You're always. You're always. You're always. Let it go. Now you're

339
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:37,940
way. You're always. You're always. You're always. On a day like today, I don't remember.

340
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:56,020
How beautiful of you could be to me. The colors that surround you, the

341
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:03,460
friends that come and found you, fits you up and crown you, the land of mine.

342
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:12,740
And I wanted to believe you. The lies that I could see through, but I never got between you.

343
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:25,300
I'm ghosting your mind. The other ghosts in your mind. It's that you're right, that you're

344
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:44,020
always. You're always. You're always. Let it go. Now you're always. You're always.

345
00:35:44,020 --> 00:36:03,380
You're always. You're always. You're always. You're always. You're always.

346
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:30,580
You're always. You're always. You're always. You're always.

347
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:35,620
Like glam ghosting your mind brand new from the boys. So on the outside music network,

348
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,380
of course, Black Lab also featured in that billboard magazine article talking about this

349
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,260
obsessed. We did bum rush the charts here right here on the Charlie 755.

350
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:52,340
And we got something that is very typical American that I want to share with you. This is

351
00:36:53,460 --> 00:37:02,820
the LA sales weasel. Hear that? They're coming in to get me. And you know, when we talk about

352
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,980
the differences between countries and you want to listen to something typical American,

353
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:13,860
this next voice comment is so 100% Yankee Doodle Dandy. It really defines, in fact,

354
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,900
you can really hear pieces of the DNA that do not exist in any other country, or I should perhaps

355
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:26,500
say any other country's culture. It is very American. And I love it. I just do it.

356
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:32,020
Hey Adam, hey, this is the sales weasel from LA. I'm on actually a little bit of vacation.

357
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,860
I'm going to visit my mom in Virginia. I'm traveling and pretty about me. Dude, I'm going to tell

358
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:44,740
you something. I talk. I talk a lot. I talk to everybody in anything. And every everyone and they are

359
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:51,700
wonderful dude. Our country is going to be okay. Our country is going to be just fine. We have

360
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,860
we have the best. And maybe we're going through some rocky times right now and pardon me,

361
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:02,020
because I haven't listened to DSC. I've been on some hotels with some crappy internet access.

362
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,820
So I just want to tell you, I consider your friend. I've been listening to hours of DSC.

363
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:14,580
And I love freedom. I love this country. I love every part of it. And there are so many

364
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:20,660
good people in this country that are doing right and doing good. And they are going to be the best.

365
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:27,140
And our kids, there is a 15 year old right now. There is a 14, 15, 16 year old right now

366
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:32,820
who is going to be take us to the level where we should be. And we've been eating a lot of

367
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:39,620
shit lately, a lot of shit, probably 20 years worth of crap. But America, you can count on it.

368
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:46,580
You can count on it because we are in us. It is in us to be Americans and to love this country and

369
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:52,660
to love freedom and to love all the good stuff and to have common sense. And I think once we start

370
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:58,420
agreeing on the things we can talk about, just, you know, what do we agree on? Forget about the

371
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:04,100
bullshit. Whether you're right or left, just agree. Just what do we talk about? Do we agree

372
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:10,820
on? Let's just get to the next level. And we are going to be okay. This country is wonderful.

373
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:16,260
I have been traveling and I needed this vacation just to realize again, realize again,

374
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:22,100
the goodness of families and people and all the great things that we have. This is the greatest

375
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:31,220
country God has ever put in any place. We are Americans, we will do okay. Regardless of who

376
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:38,340
the next president is, regardless of what we should try. What happens to us? This is a fantastic,

377
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:44,420
fantastic country. And I just want to tell you because I know you're a patriot. I know you care.

378
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:50,980
I know that all this stuff with internet is going to help us get to the next level. And when we get there,

379
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:55,940
we'll be thankful. We'll be thankful. Just as much as we're thankful for the people 100 years ago

380
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:03,700
and 200 years ago for making freedom alive. Freedom is the best. It is freedom. It is freedom that

381
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:10,500
I'll die for. It is freedom that this country was founded on. It is freedom. And we are there.

382
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,900
We will be okay. We will be fine. And I just want to tell you as a friend who hasn't listened to

383
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:22,820
your for a while. I just have been a great road trip for me. I just want to say, please add them,

384
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:27,140
so that I won't sleep at it.

385
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,820
about the high gas prices, the full prices and supermarkets,

386
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,500
but nobody does nothing today.

387
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,180
Nobody does nothing, a my time is Brooklyn.

388
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,180
If they raise the gas prices like they raise today,

389
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,780
100 cars would pull into that gas station

390
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,660
and we all start blowing the horn.

391
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,780
And we keep my hands on it on until a cops game.

392
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,860
And then we put our hands up

393
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:24,100
and tell the cops they're sticking us up.

394
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,660
Come on, fight for your rights for God's sake.

395
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,660
The politicians are watching,

396
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,260
they ain't gonna fight for you.

397
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,300
We gotta stick together.

398
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,780
Pull them fucking gas stations and keep your hand down.

399
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:41,740
And that fucking horn and wait for the fucking cops to go

400
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,860
and put your hands up and say we're getting stuck up here.

401
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:50,420
The same thing and then goddamn supermarkets.

402
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,860
Will they raise some prices over 200 fucking busset?

403
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,820
Get on it, K-C-E-L-I-N-S-N.

404
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,460
How are they fucking screaming?

405
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:04,060
And when the cops come in, just hold your hands up

406
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,220
and say they stick to me up.

407
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,340
These fucking red bastards, come on,

408
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,580
we gotta stick together.

409
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,580
We gotta fight together.

410
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,220

442
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:48,920
comes to global gasoline prices according to fellow

443
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,800
chucklehead Sergio Gasparini in Venezuela you can fill up your entire

444
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,480
car's tank for about three bucks the price for leader of gasoline

445
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,080
in Venezuela before the changing currency was 95 bullet of ours

446
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,680
one US dollars worth two thousand one hundred and fifty bullet of ours

447
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,920
so that's pretty damn cheap but i got an email from

448
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,480
Alexander Omoth and uh here's the ranking uh by cost of

449
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:21,000
gallon of gasoline okay the most expensive anywhere in the world

450
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,520
is Bosnia Herzegovina oh Herzegovina oh some might say $10.86

451
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:34,200
cents per gallon then uh let me see uh number three Norway 873 the UK

452
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,360
number four eight dollars and thirty eight cents per gallon

453
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,320
right underneath that the Netherlands eight thirty seven the

454
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,000
Netherlands of course has shell oil it just made five billion uh i'm

455
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,760
sorry it was nine billion dollars like seven or eight billion a

456
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,800
lot of billions i think of seven billion dollars in profit in this

457
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,520
past quarter alone not for the year in this quarter um

458
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,840
now at number one hundred and eleven

459
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,360
that's where the United States comes in currently listed on this chart at

460
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,880
three dollars and forty five cents so the cheapest in the world is Venezuela

461
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,640
twelve cents a gallon did the conversion there Iran forty cents a gallon

462
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,440
Saudi Arabia forty five cents a gallon and uh uh uh United States

463
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,080
amongst the number forty five on the cheapest list so uh i think we got a

464
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:25,800
way to go actually it's probably not a bad theory that uh we won't

465
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,280
really start seeing people freak out until it doubles in price and of course

466
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,600
my prediction has come true that uh the price of a barrel per oil is

467
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,640
going to be two hundred dollars before the end of this year of course that

468
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,600
all depends on who becomes president because things can go kind of

469
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,600
wacky once that happens and that'll depend upon what our new president

470
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:50,120
does in the middle least hey i'm tired i gotta go uh i'm gonna sit in the

471
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,800
garden with my wife enjoy a little bit of the sunshine the last few
