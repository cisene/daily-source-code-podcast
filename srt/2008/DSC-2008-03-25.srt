This is the real Tuesday world.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Welcome to the daily source code.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Can you dig it?

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane scrapped to my ass.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I like to wake up flying to the future.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The podcasting is a matter of curry.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's the answer.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's nothing needed.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's real cold feeling when I'm making one thing.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It really needs you, really needs you.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Take yourself and feel it now.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When it looks good, what do you mean?

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A real, really good one.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
While I love you so much,

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000

I feel it now,

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I feel it now,

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I feel it now,

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I feel it now,

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I feel it now,

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I feel it now,

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I feel it now,

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I feel it now,

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I feel it now,

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I feel it now,

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I feel it now,

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I feel it now,

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I feel it now,

I feel it now,

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I feel it now,

Feel it now,

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I feel it now,

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I feel it now,

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I feel it now,

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I feel it now,

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I feel it now,

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I feel it now,

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I feel it now,

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I feel it now,

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I feel it now,

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I feel the inside of myulated self love.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,500
I'm too full, I let up cheese for

71
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,800
I had a moment fixed, don't mama, don't wanna get fired up in the hole

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,400
I like most, you're not, I love to chew some kind of bottle, but I ain't use the deal

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,000
You would say.. I'm kinda tripping the bottle, but there's things in the net

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:58,240
It won't be free for them, but I won't be ch

75
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,760
Because I wanna say, we're a whole street, I wanna work One straight from the oven that's all we got

76
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,760
I'll see you in the next video.

77
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,760
David Jo, Christine Malone,

78
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,760
expertly matched up by FWG,

79
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,760
along with Jimmy Hendrix,

80
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Angel,

81
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,760
and Perfect Melancholy Melotune for a Tuesday.

82
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,760
Welcome to the daily source code episode number 738

83
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,760
from the first time,

84
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,760
Simon,

85
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,760
Simon Casting, I guess,

86
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,760
in a reasonable quality through live 365.

87
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,760
And that's, of course,

88
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,760
that set up as the reason there was no show yesterday.

89
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,760
I was totally fell into the trap yesterday.

90
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,760
I'm like, okay, I've got, I'm going to try something new.

91
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
I'm going to try streaming live in,

92
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,760
because that's the thing that really bothered me about talk show.

93
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,760
We had these interesting tests where you could call in

94
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,760
to the talk show number.

95
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,760
You would hear basically really crappy audio coming through,

96
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,760
kind of like a phone line connection,

97
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,760
even though it was through Skype,

98
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
it was still a dial in essentially.

99
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,760
And it just didn't sound right,

100
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,760
and I said, I'll get, let me fix that part first.

101
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,760
So, I've got,

102
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,760
I'm streaming now until live 365.

103
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,760
You can find my station.

104
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,760
It's Adam C. 1999.

105
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,760
Oh, shoot home on a second.

106
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,760
I just noticed I didn't plug my cut my,

107
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,760
the power cord in.

108
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,760
Oh no.

109
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
I didn't plug the,

110
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
everything's messed up.

111
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,760
I forgot to plug in the power to my MacBook,

112
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
but I still got an hour and 14 minutes to see.

113
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,760
We can keep the show rolling this way.

114
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,760
Yeah, so I had to get nice cast in order to use that.

115
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,760
And nice cast, and I should have known better.

116
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Then I should have known better.

117
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Name that song, young poet.

118
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,760
I should have known better that when it said,

119
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,760
hey, it looks like you have a new,

120
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,760
there's a new version of sound flower.

121
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,760
Now those of you who've been experimenting with

122
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,760
the virtual devices on the Mac,

123
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,760
you'll probably know what this is.

124
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,760
And I'm like, of course I want to know.

125
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
Oh, yeah, sure, I'll install that.

126
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Why shouldn't I have a new version of something?

127
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
Dumb, because that, of course,

128
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,760
immediately messed everything up.

129
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
The entire setup I had going,

130
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760
wouldn't work anymore.

131
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,760
And the reason why for some reason this new sound flower,

132
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
just it's a geeky thing.

133
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
This new sound flower doesn't,

134
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,760
I don't know.

135
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
It looks like a bug, actually.

136
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,760
Frequency sample rates being like round numbers,

137
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,760
like 4100 or 4800 or 9060 or 9060.

138
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,760
Instead of that,

139
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
there's a two at the end.

140
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,760
And the Apple Core audio does not like combining devices

141
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,760
that I've different sampling rates.

142
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
So, it took me a while to figure that one out.

143
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,760
And then, of course, I had to roll back

144
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,760
and, I messed everything up.

145
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,760
It took me a long, long time.

146
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,760
I wound up learning a lot of things about Ableton Live, actually,

147
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,760
as I was playing live music yesterday.

148
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,760
But it was cool because I could set mixes up

149
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
in the future before they actually played.

150
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,760
As the program was playing out,

151
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,760
stuff, so I did learn some things there.

152
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
But essentially, it took away,

153
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,760
it took away from our time together.

154
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
And I'm in a kind of a weird mood today,

155
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,760
because there's so many weird things going on

156
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
in the world.

157
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,760
There's just so many real major topics of conversation.

158
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
And people are sending me all this stuff.

159
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,760
Remember, you were the guys that really put the show together.

160
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
So, I want to make sure that I represent

161
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,760
all that you were thinking, including, of course,

162
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
some sexy shit from Cat and Chris.

163
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
And why not?

164
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Adam's Captain Chris is a playman as podcast,

165
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:38,760
but hey, man, I wanted to bring her attention to a redhead,

166
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
flight attendant at Delta Airlines,

167
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,760
who is doing a new end flight safety video over there.

168
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,760
And I think once you see her,

169
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
you'll see what I'm talking about.

170
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,760
And it's the awesome to get her on the daily source code.

171
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
So I'll try to get some more information.

172
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
I sent you a link to the video,

173
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
so you can check her out.

174
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,760
And that's it.

175
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
And I hope all's good.

176
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
And see you at flight safety.

177
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
Yeah, thanks, man.

178
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
I looked at that video.

179
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
You can find it over to PlainMadness.com.

180
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
That's Captain Chris's podcast.

181
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
PLA-N-E.

182
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,760
PlainMadness.com.

183
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,760
I hear you.

184
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,760
How come I never have those flight attendants on my flight?

185
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Oh my goodness.

186
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,760
I would sit in coach if she was giving the demonstration.

187
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,760
I would sacrifice all of that.

188
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Lots of you responding to the conversation topics

189
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
from the past week or two.

190
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
Here's an email from Gordon Walton,

191
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
who said me this link,

192
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,760
which I knew nothing about.

193
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Apparently,

194
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,760
in every single state in the United States,

195
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,760
newborn babies,

196
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
are tested for genetics.

197
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,760
You believe this?

198
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
And I was looking at this webpage.

199
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,760
I'm like, this can't be true,

200
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,760
but it's actually the National newborn screening

201
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
and genetics resource center.

202
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,760
And I'll put a link to this in the show notes, of course.

203
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,760
And I guess the main thing here.

204
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Here we go.

205
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Parent and family resources.

206
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
And they have PDFs available,

207
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,760
so you can see what tests are done

208
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,760
on a new Whoa.

209
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Oh, oh.

210
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,760
Oh, don't do that to me.

211
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,760
She's breaking up Jim.

212
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Alright.

213
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Wait a minute.

214
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,760
Oh man.

215
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Let me try this for a second.

216
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Check it too.

217
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
Oh man.

218
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
Oh, I'm running.

219
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,760
I don't know what to do.

220
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,760
It's all necessary.

221
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Well, I'd have to say,

222
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,760
that was pretty interesting.

223
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
Oh man.

224
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
You know what?

225
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,760
When something ain't broke,

226
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Adam just don't go trying to freaking fix it.

227
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Will ya?

228
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
I'm such an idiot.

229
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Meanwhile,

230
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,760
people were Skyping and let me see if,

231
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
oh,

232
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
baby,

233
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
I can't take that file from you right now.

234
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
I can't take any files.

235
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Anyway,

236
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
uh,

237
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
back to this genetic screening thing.

238
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
Hold on.

239
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
So here under the FAQs,

240
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,760
why does my baby need newborn screening tests?

241
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Well,

242
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
answer most babies are healthy when they're born.

243
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,760
We test all babies because a few babies look healthy,

244
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
but have a rare health problem.

245
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
If we find problems early,

246
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
we can help prevent serious problems like mental

247
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
retardation or death,

248
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
or criminal activity,

249
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
perhaps.

250
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Interesting.

251
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
Keep our eyes on that.

252
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Uh,

253
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
doesn't look like the exact same thing we were talking about

254
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
over here in the UK,

255
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
that Scott will yard announcing,

256
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
hey,

257
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
we should have a debate about

258
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,760
screening kids five years of an older.

259
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
You know,

260
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
this is half thing again.

261
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,760
I don't know if I'm going to make it through this show,

262
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,760
where this crap going on.

263
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
Okay.

264
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
Um,

265
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
yeah,

266
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,760
we'll give it another shot.

267
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
There we go.

268
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
I'm just messing with the settings.

269
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
Now,

270
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,760
just trying to get it said,

271
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,760
so that everything works and doesn't fall apart on me.

272
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
It sounds,

273
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
it's something with the,

274
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
uh,

275
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
with the sound device that's messy.

276
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
You know what?

277
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
It's just messed up.

278
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
I'm sorry.

279
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
What can I tell you?

280
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
Um,

281
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
okay.

282
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,760
Let me see what other stuff do we have.

283
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
More email that came in.

284
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
Hey, Adam,

285
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
listen to the football Friday show at the beginning.

286
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
There was a mashup with Queens.

287
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,760
Another one bites the dust,

288
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
where they were playing it backwards.

289
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
I remembered in the old times,

290
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
used to play another hit test like game called

291
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
the back track podcast.

292
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
If I'm not mistaken,

293
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
whatever happened to that.

294
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,760
Says Antonio Solgado.

295
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
I don't know,

296
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
man.

297
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
I like doing it a lot,

298
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
but it just kind of disappeared.

299
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
You know?

300
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,760
People send stuff in and then they stop sending stuff in.

301
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
I pay young people to do the hit test

302
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
so that I know it's there.

303
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Every single week.

304
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,760
I really appreciate the work that he puts into it.

305
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Uh,

306
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
Let me see.

307
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Oh, you know,

308
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
I did spend some time yesterday since I kind of blew the whole,

309
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
uh,

310
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
the whole opportunity to do a show.

311
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
And, uh,

312
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
and you know,

313
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
with all that live testing stuff.

314
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Um,

315
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
I took another look at the Google,

316
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
the eye Google homepage.

317
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,760
If you look at this thing in a while,

318
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
they've gotten pretty sophisticated

319
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
with all the widgets that you can install on there.

320
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
And, uh,

321
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
in fact,

322
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
you can display like a Twitter module.

323
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
And, uh,

324
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
a Google reader module.

325
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,760
And, of course,

326
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,760
a Gmail module.

327
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
It really,

328
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
I have to tell you.

329
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,760
I was quite impressed.

330
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
I, um,

331
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
I set up my,

332
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
my Mac dashboard widgets.

333
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,760
I do use a number of those quite frequently,

334
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
actually,

335
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
just because one swipe to the upper left hand corner

336
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
of the screen with the mouse and it appears, right?

337
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
But having,

338
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
um,

339
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
a web browser page open with all that information.

340
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
That, uh,

341
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,760
that I'm, uh,

342
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
that I'm interested in,

343
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
just sitting right there and refreshing dynamically.

344
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
I'm,

345
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
yeah,

346
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
I got to tell you.

347
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
It's, uh,

348
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
pretty appreciative of it.

349
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,760
Jam on his,

350
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
uh,

351
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
oh,

352
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
by the way,

353
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
I'm, I'm looking at Twitter throughout this experiment with,

354
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
um,

355
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,760
Simon Casting on live 365.

356
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
Jam on says,

357
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
loving the live show experience even when it breaks.

358
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
That's probably the best part when it breaks, right?

359
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
Dave Johnson,

360
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,760
you are suffering from too much technology syndrome.

361

Okay.

Yes.

367
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,760

Spice special Twitter request

503
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,760
However, actually I think we're singing the songs

504
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
She tweets me just now

505
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
Oh, man, I love that a lot

506
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Actually, those of you listening in on the live stream now heard one of my secrets to success

507
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,760
You heard me pick up a broken link because the minute I cracked the mic at the end of that song

508
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,760
It went all ballistic on me again

509
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,760
I clearly have not yet figured out what the exact configuration was

510
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Because it was working so fine before until I had to go and mess it all up

511
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,760
Andrew coffee sent me a tweet as well

512
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,760
He said apple rumors today on 3G apples up the shorts are not working

513
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,760
That's interesting

514
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,760
So we got some hot financial stock tips for you

515
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Well, we're at it

516
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,760
You heard the intro today two today show

517
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,760
Which was a nice Michael Jackson slash thriller type intro

518
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
This is because Joseph Vela

519
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,760
Was hired by Sony BMG to create the thriller cast

520
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,760
Which is a series of podcasts individual episodes

521
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:20,760
With someone who has either worked with or been a part of the phenomenon known as Michael Jackson

522
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
And

523
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Mainly as it pertains to the thriller album

524
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:32,760
Which was released what 25 years ago to date and my episode which I did a couple weeks ago in San Francisco drops today

525
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,760
In fact, I've got a little piece of it that I can play for just to give you an idea

526
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,760
And there's a lot of very interesting people who are doing these episodes

527
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,760
So you can find that at michaeljaxon.com slash podcast here.

Hi, this is Adam Curry of the Daily Source Code

532
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,760
And of course the former MTV guy

533
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Welcome to my thriller cast

534
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,760
I'll play a first bit for you just to get a little taste of it

535
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,760
The first time I heard through actually I think I was in college

536
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,760
I went to college for about three months which is a very successful educational career

537
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
I was in West Virginia

538
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,760
But I remember very well when thriller came out

539
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,760
And it wasn't so much even Michael Jackson honestly that just blew me away

540
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,760
It was the production of this record

541
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,760
Alright for the rest of it you'll have to go to michaeljaxon.com slash podcast

542
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,760
Oh man there's also a delay now in my voice

543
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,760
So when I'm talking I hear it like half a second later

544
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
You don't want to know about all my problems I do you

545
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Here's a cool piece of voicemail feedback

546
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,760
Actually I think it's this isn't even a voicemail

547
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,760
This is a full on full blown recording

548
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Because my friends from Jamaica are tuned in

549
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Mr. Curry

550
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,760
This is Dijamekan in New York

551
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,760
Lo me to introduce myself

552
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,760
Well, I'm a loyal listener of the DSC

553
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
And you know I've been listening for a couple years now

554
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,760
Yes, yes, it is true

555
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,760
You do have Jamaican listeners

556
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Well at least one

557
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,760
That makes you cool. Cooler than you thought you were actually

558
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Cooler than here

559
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760
The here makes you

560
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,760
No, I was listening to DSC

561
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
726

562
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,760
And I was thinking myself

563
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
This is what I heard

564
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Take a listen

565
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
I think I do our thing

566
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
What do you do every night

567
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,760
And if I'm battery if I'm not seen someone else

568
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
Really

569
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,760
This is very interesting on him

570
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,760
I was thinking to myself you know there are quite a few things that I am an expert in

571
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Some some which I'll reveal to you later

572
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,760
But no, no this

573
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,760
This is definitely a part of my expertise

574
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
I'm thinking you know

575
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,760
I'm in New York I live in Brooklyn

576
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Brooklyn

577
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
And she lives in Brooklyn

578
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
There's just no reason

579
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
This sort of thing to be occurring

580
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
I agree man

581
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
Okay

582
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Yeah

583
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
She

584
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
She could use some help

585
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
And I

586
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,760
I'm volunteering to be assistant

587
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,760
To this this thing that is going on

588
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
That's right

589
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
That's right

590
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,760
I feel like there's a space for me

591
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,760
In this

592
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
One problem though Adam

593
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,760
Yeah, what's that man

594
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,760
I don't know her

595
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,760
And you are my gateway my friend

596
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
So Adam, hook it up

597
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
Hook it up

598
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760

I'm in this senior brother

601
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
Let's get this thing on the road

602
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Jimmy can in New York Adam

603
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
There's four

604
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,760
Folder, not a scruncher

605
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Big hero who'll be in the upper blind

606
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
I'm only going to do this one time

607
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
Love you know

608
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
All right

609
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Cool

610
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Thanks for listening to today's podcast

611
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
That's the Jamaican in New York

612
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,760
I knew Savannah on the Charlie

613
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,760
I'm pretty sure I could help you

614
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
I do, it shouldn't be too much of a problem

615
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,760
I do have some Skype databases if you're interested

616
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Somehow because we're doing a live today

617
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
I feel like it should be played more amusing

618
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Is Dolce Vita right?

619
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,760
We are walking like in the Dolce Vita

620
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,760
This time we've got it right

621
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,760
We're living like in the Dolce Vita

622
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,760
I'm gonna dream tonight

623
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,760
We're dancing like in the Dolce Vita

624
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,760
We're like some music home

625
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,760
I love this made in the Dolce Vita

626
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
Nobody else than you

627
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,760
It's all it's night

628
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Together with our love again

629
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,760
Another light

630
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Before we're trying to say

631
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,760
You never live enough

632
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,760
Say you're gonna love enough

633
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,760
We made it down the Dolce Vita

634
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,760
We're living like in the Dolce Vita

635
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,760
We're living like in the Dolce Vita

636
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,760
I'm so alone in the Dolce Vita

637
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Oh baby, tell the phone

638
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,760
There's magic going in the Dolce Vita

639
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
Nobody else than you

640
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,760
It's all it's night

641
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Together with our love again

642
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,760
Another light before we're trying to say

643
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,760
You never live enough

644
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
Say you're gonna love enough

645
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,760
It's all it's night

646
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Together with our love again

647
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,760
Another light before we're trying to say

648
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
You never live enough

649
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,760
Say you're gonna love enough

650
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:27,760
I'm at the first of natural

651
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,760
I was supposed to spend 36

652
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,760
I can show myself a spin the right field crowd

653
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
Thanks to you

654
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,760
There's been a few things I've been up this agreed with you in the past

655
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,760
For number one being the moon conspiracy thing

656
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,760
That was maybe last year or year before

657
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,760
I agree everything with what you were saying about the DNA

658
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,760
With the exception of the global warming thing

659
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,760
I don't think it's probably a good idea to be lumping that into everything

660
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,760
Because I'm sure there are going to be people who are going to try and scan you

661
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,760
And all that would be screen credits and all that's fake everything

662
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,760
But I, I honestly believe that global warming is true

663
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,760
And I'm sure you know there are tons of people who agree with me

664
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,760
But yeah, otherwise keep up everything from what you're doing on this whole DNA thing

665
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
That's disturbing

666
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,760
I, and I love you

667
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,760
And I hug you in right here and all that stuff

668
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,760
It's a music home

669
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,760
I love it's feelings that don't you've been done

670
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,760
Nobody else than you

671
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,760
It's all it's not to get along again

672
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,760
I'm not alive

673
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,760
In what we're trying to say

674
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
You never really know

675
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Say you've got a girl now

676
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,760
We're living like a needle to die

677
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,760
I'm not a dream tonight

678
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,760
We're dancing like in a wheelchair

679
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,760
Nobody else than you

680
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,760
It's all it's not to get along again

681
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,760
I'm not alive

682
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,760
Before we're trying to say you never really know

683
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,760
Oh say you've got a girl now

684
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:36,760
It's all it's not to get along again

685
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
I'm not alive

686
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
It doesn't get much more 80s than that now, doesn't it?

687
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,760
I'm not alive

688
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
I'm not alive

689
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
I'm not alive

690
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
I'm not alive

691
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
I'm not alive

692
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,760
It doesn't get much more 80s than that now, does it?

693
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
On your daily source code for today episode number 738

694
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,760
So I finally got everything kind of working and looking for some feedback on Twitter

695
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,760
And then what is Twitter if I show me?

696
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
Twitter error

697
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
Twitter return a bad request error

698
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,760
This happens when you exceed 70 requests per hour

699
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
Avoid running other Twitter applications or refreshing too frequently

700
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Nice

701
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,760
So now I can't get any feedback either

702
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,760
That's what this show is all about

703
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
Experimentation

704
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,760
In the technical sense as well as in the

705
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Well civil sense

706
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
The psychological sense

707
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,760
The advertising sense

708
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,760
Ooh, I should probably do an advertisement, that's a good one

709
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,760
Dude, have you seen the price on the Nokia and 810

710
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
How incredibly cheap that's become?

711
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,760
Especially with pod shows, exclusive 15% offer

712
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
If you want one of these internet tablets and by the way

713
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,760
I think they don't they also have

714
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
There was some tie in there with the e-music

715
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
Candyman sent me a note about that

716
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,760
Of course I promptly forgot let me just take a look and see

717
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,760
E-music

718
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,760
Luke, this is always a good way to do it

719
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
Here we go

720
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,760
Yeah, they work together

721
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
Let's put it that way

722
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
I'm not going to tell you about the e-music promotion

723
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Just at this moment I want to do that on Fridays

724
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,760
Keep that kind of exclusive to Friday and the soundtrack of our lives

725
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
Oh wait a minute, Twitter

726
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Rekindled all of a sudden, there we go

727
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Brittany Mason on, good to see everyone in the house

728
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
Okay, there's something I want to play for you that

729
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,760
Without a doubt, we'll be deemed very controversial by many

730
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,760
But I really feel like I have to play this because this is a fellow countryman

731
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,760
In this case, a Brit, his name is Pat Kondel

732
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,760
And I stumbled upon this guy through a number of different avenues

733
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,760
You know the story about this Dutch politician, his name is Heardveilders

734
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,760
And although I don't think his party has any seats in the government

735
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,760
Well, I'm not even sure about that

736
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,760
He's in the government clearly because he speaks in the Parliament

737
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,760
So he has been promising someone say threatening

738
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,760
But he's been promising to release a 15-minute film called Fittna

739
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
Fittna of the movie

740
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,760
And this is supposed to be, well, some call it

741
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,760
Racist film, although no one has seen it as far as I know

742
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,760
His whole platform in the Netherlands is look

743
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,760
There's a million immigrants who have come into the country

744
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,760
And they are living by Islam rule, strict Islam rule, not all of them

745
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Of course, but these are his numbers, not mine

746
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,760
And he's saying that a number of things, although I haven't heard him say everything

747
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,760
First hand, a lot of this is reporting, that's just out there

748
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
And that's, you know how that works, right?

749
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
I mean, I saw this happen with Pimfortan

750
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
There was assassinated one week before the general election

751
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,760
And this was in 2000, I believe

752
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,760
And he was so on track to win, in fact he won posthumously

753
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,760
So it was assassinated and his party won the next week

754
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
Anyway, won the elections

755
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,760
And he was basically running on a very similar platform

756
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,760
He was saying, look, you know, if people who are strict Islam

757
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
I want to live in the Netherlands, that's fine

758
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,760
But you have to live by our civil rules and actual laws

759
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,760
And he called, where do you call Islam?

760
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,760
He called it backwards, he said it's a backwards religion

761
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,760
And of course, in the strictest sense of the word, you'd have to agree

762
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
When it comes to general mutilation

763
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,760
You know, the women's rights

764
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,760
Honor killings, a whole bunch of stuff that goes on

765
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,760
Now, I have no idea what the real scale is of people who are

766
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,760
Fundamentalist, Islamist, or

767
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,760
Extreme Islamists, it's certainly not all Muslims

768
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,760
And it's not all Islamists, but anyway,

769
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,760
I guess what's happening is there's a conversation that is not taking place in Europe

770
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,760
And the conversation is what takes place behind closed doors

771
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
Where lots of people agree on what they're saying

772
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,760
But they never go out and say that in public

773
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
Can I get a break here, people?

774
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,760
No one will go out and say these things publicly

775
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Because it's not deemed politically correct

776
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,760
But I do want to play this a piece of audio for you

777
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,760
Now it's rather long, it's about six or seven minutes

778
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
It's from a YouTube video, this guy has a channel

779
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,760
And he is speaking the way I've heard many many

780
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,760
Brits speak in the past couple years that we've been here

781
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,760
So I think it's worth it to have a listen

782
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
I don't agree with everything he says

783
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
Which I know sounds like a cop out, but it's not

784
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Maybe I agree with what he says, maybe I don't necessarily agree with the way he says it

785
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,760
Or sometimes it just cuts the corners a little bit too short for me

786
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
But man, I've heard this conversation everywhere

787
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,760
First time I've actually seen a proper Englishman stand up and say the following

788
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,760
According to a recent opinion poll, many Muslims say that the way for the West

789
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,760
To have better relations with Islam is to show it more respect

790
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,760
And who said Muslims don't have a sense of humour

791
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,760
Given that Islam is officially above criticism in the West

792
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,760
It's hard to imagine how we could give it any more respect

793
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,760
Short of closing down all the pubs, growing bids and beating up women

794
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,760
Who don't want to dress like nuns?

795
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
Ah yes, of course, silly me

796
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,760
I think many people in the West are now realising that Islam has already been given far to much respect

797
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,760
Especially here in Europe, we're according to another poll

798
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
People now see it as a threat to their culture

799
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,760
The carry on accommodating it's every demand of course

800
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
But this is not because Islam is welcome in Europe, far from it

801
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,760
It's because people have been conditioned by the lie of multiculturalism

802
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,760
To believe that what they should think is more important than what they do think

803
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,760
Although people will criticise Islam in private

804
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,760
They know that to do so publicly, in other words, to be honest about their feelings

805
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,760
Would instantly make them racist and Islamophobes and Nazis and disgusting imperialist

806
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,760
Ethnocentric fascist bastards grinding their jackboots into the faces of the innocent and the weak

807
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,760
So best not make a fuss, you want to beat your wife and mutilate your daughter, be our guest

808
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
We'll even subsidise it because we want to be your friend

809
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,760
What's that? You want to destroy our corrupt society?

810
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Well, that's our fault, not yours

811
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
Here, have some more money

812
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,760
This film that's coming out in Holland shortly, which has got the whole country in a state of heightened terrorist alert

813
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Is yet more proof that everything in Europe now needs to be measured against the possibility of Muslim violence

814
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,760
Every play, every film, every art exhibition, every magazine article

815
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,760
In fact, our whole culture is now subject to Muslim approval

816
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
I just want to stop this guy there for a second

817
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,760
Boy, is he right there, huh?

818
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
Is he right there?

819
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,760
It's absolutely true that there's this meme out there, this vibe, it's like whatever you do

820
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,760
Don't say anything against Islam because it'll start all kinds of shit

821
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,760
Interesting though, huh?

822
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,760
Interesting

823
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,760
Because yeah, look, I even take God's name in vain on this program many, many times

824
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,760
Although people don't like it and they get angry with me about it

825
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,760
That's about the extent of it

826
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,760
But then this is Europe and we have a history of appeasement and caving into threats

827
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,760
Radical Islam knows this and is playing us like a violin

828
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,760
They know that Islam will never get blamed for anything in Europe

829
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,760
No matter what happens

830
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,760
So that for example when the Danish press reprinted the cartoons recently

831
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Which was followed by a week of rioting by a Muslim youth

832
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,760
Copenhagen's chief of police refused to admit that it had anything to do with the cartoons

833
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,760
He said it was because they were born

834
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Yes, that's right

835
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,760
They all rushed out and set fire to the city every night for a week for something to do

836
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,760
If only they'd had a table tennis club

837
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,760
The whole thing happened because three Islamic fanatics were caught planning to murder the cartoonist

838
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,760
Imagine how bored they must have been

839
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,760
Oh yes, also a newsflash for European journalists

840
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,760
An anti-Semitic attack by Muslims on Jews is not a conflict between communities

841
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,760
In case you hadn't noticed Islam hates Jews

842
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,760
Even if Israel didn't exist, Islam would still hate Jews

843
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,760
Their holy book tells Muslims that they should hate Jews

844
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,760
So I think you'll find what's happening is not a conflict between communities at all

845
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,760
But a violent unprovoked racist attack by Muslims on Jews because they're Jews

846
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Just thought I'd clear that one up for you so that you can report it accurately next time

847
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,760
If you bother to report it at all

848
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,760
If we were serious about respecting Islam, we would give it an honest reality check

849
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,760
Islam needs to adapt to Europe, not the other way around

850
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:34,760
Now I know a lot of Muslims actually agree with this and they make an effort to adapt and to rub along with everybody else

851
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,760
Which is great, and it's very welcome

852
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,760
But we all know that a lot of others don't, which is why many European cities

853
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,760
Have large Muslim ghettos controlled by religious bigots

854
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,760
Where indigenous laws and values are increasingly unwell come

855
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,760
Places full of people who have no intention of integrating

856
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,760
And who want nothing less than the end of our civilization

857
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,760
While we pander and defer to them thanks to a biased press and complacent judiciary

858
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,760
And the kind of politicians you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy

859
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
Actually you probably would

860
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,760
And this situation is as much as threat to the freedom of ordinary Muslims as it is to everybody else

861
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,760
And it's a clear indication of what we need in Europe now is not more respect for Islam

862
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,760
It's less respect for Islam and more respect for ourselves

863
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,760
We need to stop pretending because that's what we're doing

864
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,760
Pretending that all cultures are equal

865
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
Where we can clearly see that they're not

866
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,760
Islamic culture is not equal to Western culture

867
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,760
It encourages violence against women against Jews and homosexuals

868
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,760
Its sanctions polygamy and marrying old men to young children in a disgusting

869
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
Travesty of human relations

870
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,760
Anyone in the West advocating these kinds of values would very quickly find themselves in jail

871
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,760
It's not equal, it's inferior

872
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,760
And given radical Islam's openness about it's totalitarian agenda

873
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,760
This is not something that should be encouraged in any way

874
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:04,760
It should be discouraged by firm legislation and by rigorous enforcement of the law

875
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,760
Remember the law?

876
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:14,760
Now I know that I'm going to be accused of racism and Islamophobia by the usual self-righteous pinheads

877
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,760
But I don't mind because those words have no value in this context

878
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,760
One has been neutralised by repeated dishonest misuse

879
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,760
And the other is just a bare face lie

880
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,760
Concorted by the political left in tandem with the religious right in a marriage of convenience

881
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,760
Which is well quite simply beneath content

882
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,760
A phobia is an irrational fear

883
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,760
Resisting Islam is not irrational

884
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,760
Pandering to it is irrational

885
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Indulging the lie that Islamic culture is somehow equal to Western culture

886
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,760
While ignoring the victims of that culture is more than irrational

887
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
It's downright criminal

888
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,760
And if you really want to talk about racism

889
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,760
Then look no further than the poisonous fiction of multiculturalism

890
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,760
A divisive and patronizing racist ideology

891
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,760
And the governments of Europe who promote it are racist governments

892
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,760
The civil servants who pander to it are racist

893
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,760
The university lecturers who encourage it are racist

894
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,760
The journalists who lie about it are racist

895
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,760
And the ordinary people who say one thing in private

896
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,760
And another in public are cowardly racist hypocrites

897
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:29,760
If we can't bring ourselves to say what's in our hearts when it truly matters

898
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,760
Then we've already given up our freedom and with it the freedom of future generations

899
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,760
Which is something that we've got no right to do

900
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,760
We didn't earn this freedom

901
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,760
It was handed to us on a plate by people who did earn it with their lights

902
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,760
We don't own it, we're custodians of it

903
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,760
It's not ours to give away

904
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,760
So it's time to speak up Europe

905
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,760
It's time to stop whining and belly aching about the Americans for five minutes

906
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
And show a little backbone for once

907
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
Just once

908
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,760
Or do we want to spend the rest of our lives cowering like frightened mice

909
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:12,760
From a handful of violent bigots who think they have a right to poke a finger into our chest

910
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,760
And tell us how we're allowed to live

911
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,760
What we can and can't do say and think

912
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,760
Well, I don't know about you

913
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,760
But anyone who asks me that question is going to get a very short answer

914
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,760
And I'll give you a clue it won't contain the words Allah or Akbar

915
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,760
Peace

916
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,760
Wouldn't that be nice

917
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,760
Alright, so

918
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,760
How loaded is that guy?

919
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,760
I mean loaded with ammo

920
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,760
I wish I was that eloquent

921
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,760
Because in the context of what he was saying, boy, it made a lot of sense

922
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,760
And I think there's a lot of things we can discuss about this

923
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,760
In particular, that this conversation is taking place

924
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,760
I have seen this, I've witnessed this happening with my own two eyes

925
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,760
In the Netherlands

926
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,760
I hear it here in the UK and people aren't speaking out

927
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,760
I'm not saying it's right or wrong

928
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,760
But that they're not talking about it in public

929
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
They're keeping that behind closed doors

930
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
That is a fact

931
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760
See on Twitter people are interested in

932
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
And whining out more about this guy

933
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,760
His name is Pat Kondel

934
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
You can find him at patkondel.net

935
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,760
P-A-T-C-O-N-D-E-L-L.net

936
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,760
Of course, I'll put a link to that in the show notes

937
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,760
Have you stuffed though?

938
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,760
You know?

939
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:34,760
And the thing that really hit home with me is this whole idea of the multi-cultural society

940
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,760
And I have to agree, I think that is full of shit

941
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,760
Alright, we play one more time

942
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,760
And then get out of your hair

943
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,760
But that's homework clearly for the rest of the week

944
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,760
What do you think about this guy Pat that Kondel is saying?

945
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,760
It's funny how the smile in your eyes

946
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:00,760
I slowly fade in with last days and July

947
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,760
The year is drowning like the calendar rose thin

948
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,760
And set away again

949
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,760
You're back against the wind

950
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,760
Don't know how cold will blow your ball

951
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:22,760
And I will hold my head again

952
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,760
But you can't run from our juice

953
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,760
Oh, the light in red

954
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,760
Oh, the light in red

955
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,760
Oh, the light in red

956
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,760
Oh, the light in red

957
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,760
Oh, the light in red

958
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,760
Oh, the light in red

959
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,760
Oh, the light in red

960
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,760
Oh, the light in red

961
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,760
Oh, the light in red

962
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,760
Oh, the light in red

963
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,760
Oh, the light in red

964
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,760
Oh, the light in red

965
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,760
Oh, the light in red

966
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,760
Oh, the light in red

967
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,760
Oh, the light in red

968
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,760
Oh, the light in red

969
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,760
Oh, the light in red

970
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,760
Oh, the light in red

971
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,760
Oh, the light in red

972
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,760
Oh, the light in red

973
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,760
Oh, the light in red

974
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
Oh, the light in red

975
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,760
Oh, the light in red

976
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,760
Oh, the light in red

977
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,760
Oh, the light in red

978
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,760
Oh, the light in red

979
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,760
Oh, the light in red

980
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:30,760
Oh, the light in red

981
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:36,760
Oh, the light in red

982
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:43,000
Don't say it loud, you'll be no less than what's on your face

983
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,600
I swear I'm falling for that song that you will stick

984
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:54,720
I can't shoot, I'll leave it, I'll take it anywhere you

985
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:01,800
Don't say it anywhere, you'll be no less than what's on your mind

986
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:08,800
You'll be no less than what's on your face

987
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,800
You'll be no less than what's on your face

988
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:20,800
You'll be no less than what's on your face

989
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,800
We're the living, London Rain from the Podsafe Music Network

990
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,800
Very appropriate, I think for this part of the show

991
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,800
Lots of Twitter's coming in

992
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,800
Christian says, Adam, most of those things could also be said about Christianity

993
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,800
I'm not a big fan of organized religion in general, honestly

994
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,800
Gun for hire, is that the BNPs, that's the British National Party's Nick Griffin speaking

995
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,800
No, not at all

996
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,800
I don't think this guy is politically motivated, I think he's just a Brit who has something to say

997
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,800
That's what I kind of liked about him

998
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,800
He looks like a TV producer, I know actually

999
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,800
He's like a really regular guy, he doesn't look very radical, he doesn't look very hateful

1000
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,800
But I think he's just speaking his mind, and it's very refreshing to hear that

1001
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
At least that little bit

1002
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,800
Okay, so that's homework everybody, we'll talk about that tomorrow

1003
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,800
On the rest of the week, I'll be around most of it Thursday amount

1004
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,800
I think I got some meetings in London to take care of

1005
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,800
There's a couple of phone numbers at dailysourcecode.com

1006
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,800
You can call and leave a voicemail message up to three minutes y'all

1007
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,800
So I'd love to hear from you

1008
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,800
Don't we speak tomorrow?

1009
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,800
Hey, make sure you live your life with passion

1010
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,800
And while it lasts my friends, enjoy your freedom

1011
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,800
Another hot show podcast, stick it in your ear
