1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 7-7-8

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There's nothing more romantic than fantasy

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And we can make the war on terror distract

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And like videos and TV shows with scanily cloud winning

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Covering with oil, rub it in like lotion

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But at 16s and the skies and the battleships in the ocean

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The voters won't notice

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Tell them to eat or with this

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Are you against us in the same breath over vaccinated

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Our soldiers they'll want to believe these lies are true

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To the point that even Cynthia McKinney with proof

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We'll be able to convince them that there's a connection between the war on terror

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And the Carl Hub will be able to believe these lies are true

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
As I said, all the vaccinate our soldiers

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And hold their ammunition with radio active to you

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Fear is the final frontier for defenseless

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If it's logical, tell them it's senseless

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
She either with us or you're against us

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's all about confusion

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Name it the Patriot Act

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If it acts against the constitution

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
One man, one vote is a joke

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You should be more concerned about your family being broke

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Poof

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Mirror

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Smoke

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now watch me raise, spending and lower taxes

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The answer to any question at the 911 Commission I'd ask is

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We believe that stem cell researchers in the world

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
North Korea has WMD's translation

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Time for Operation Iraqi Freedom

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sacrifice American laws on Baghdad, soil

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Unmore from our investments in defense

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And increase our supply of oil

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The question is, how can we have it done anything about the genocide and the four

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The answer is

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We believe in protecting the same entity of marriage

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Just give them a slogan, let's roll

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're gonna smoke them out of their holes

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Watch the hands, watch the hands

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And this hand, oh son of Bin Laden

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And this hand, the world traits and are exposed now

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I know you want me to get them for you

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But the 200 billion dollar question is

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
How much is it worth to you

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
For me to allow my colonies and investments

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And defense to work for you

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Don't worry about what we knew prior to the fact

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
About the attacks

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's a distraction

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Careland, look away from the oil fields

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The important thing to remember is that voting for my opponent will get you killed

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There's a connection between his election and your family's demise

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's why African-American voters have to be disenfranchised

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Neon democracy means the electronic voting machine companies

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Get to help us decide that way you can win the election and still lose

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's the new world order

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Global economy, no borders, no sovereignty

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
With those cries, corporate democracy, true lies

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And the next generation radio contenting my ears

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We don't need not to dinging, dinging, dinging

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I like to think I'm flying, dinging, dinging, dinging

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
On gas, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That'll carry

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The children on the street, using guns and knives

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We're taking drugs, and each other's lives

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Kill any child or with knives and folks

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We're calling each other names like drugs

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There's people on the street

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Get to see us from my kids

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, that's what I said

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Get to see us from my kids

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Now there's junkies with monkeys, there's these

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Who's such a new monkey's police

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
These leave these pauses, monkeys alone

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They got problems and obviously ill

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Man, there's a line on the streets

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
On punks, chopped up his head

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm the only one who starts

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
She's his day health

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Truths out he's dead

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And that's why I'm singing why

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why is wrong with the world today

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why is wrong with the world today

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why is wrong with the world today

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why is wrong with the world today

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You got to think about it

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You got to think about it

You got to think about it

248
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You got to think about it

249
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You got to go think about it

250
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Go think about it

251
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That you got to think about it

252
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You got to think about it

253
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You got to think about it

254
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You got to think about it

255
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You got to think about it

256
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You got to think about it

257
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You got to think about it

258
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Afteriu

259
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Obviously

260
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Okay

261
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And then if you ask about it

262
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You got to think about it

263
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You got to think about it

264
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You got out of it

265
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
My mom's second husband, who of course is now part of the family.

266
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,440
And I stayed overnight, hung out with him, where I learned something incredible.

267
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,880
I've never been into Pink Floyd and certainly not Roger Waters, and he's built a huge

268
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,120
wide-screen DVD system in the house now with the 5.1 Dolby Surround System and speakers

269
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,360
hidden everywhere and bass woofers.

270
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:29,520
He put on a live concert of Roger Waters and I was blown away because they have the subtitle

271
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,600
feature and I'm looking at these lyrics and reading a lot, I had no idea how political

272
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
these were.

273
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,920
I can't believe that it's been 20 years for me to get turned on to Roger Waters.

274
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,400
Definitely check, I should play that song.

275
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,360
I'll see if I can find it and I'll play it tomorrow.

276
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,480
I'm used to death, oh man, it fits so perfectly in our days today.

277
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,440
So I went off on Saturday then up to the Northeast corner.

278
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,120
That was another couple hundred kilometers and it's really fantastic.

279
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,640
It's not easy to find a spot to put anything into a Jaguar underneath the bonnet as it's

280
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,920
officially called.

281
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,680
Now this hydroxy booster we've talked about on the source code before if you're new to

282
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
the show.

283
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:18,840
It's essentially a pot of water that has electrodes in it, the pieces of rust-free steel.

284
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,440
Is that what it's called?

285
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,000
Stainless steel, I'm sorry, rust-free, stainless steel and you put a current on that, which

286
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,320
is the process of basically separating the water, which gives you hydrogen.

287
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,960
This is like a high school experiment, so nothing, no big there, right?

288
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,600
Except then you take a tube and you route that through a safety device called the

289
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:49,120
bubbler, which basically makes sure that hopefully this main device doesn't implode should

290
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,800
some kind of fire get shot back from the engine, but you basically hook it up to the air intake

291
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,280
of your engine.

292
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,760
And then the theory is, is because this is now being mixed with the air and gasoline mixture

293
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,120
that it's going to replace this highly explosive gas, which burns very cleanly, by the way,

294
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,920
a very low- if any emissions.

295
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
I don't think any.

296
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,240
It's like water comes out of it after explosion, after ignition, and I'm no physicist, I'm

297
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,040
just talking when I learned previously and on the day itself.

298
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:26,080
The theory is that it then will basically use less gasoline, less petrol, because that's

299
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,640
being replaced by this hydrogen.

300
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,720
And I know a couple of guys have installed it and they say it works and I've read all of the

301
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,200
negative comments about it, and of course there's people out there with MLM schemes for

302
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
selling these things.

303
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,840
You can make this yourself, like Guy, I got it from basically made it himself, florist

304
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:50,480
as his name, with some PVC tubing and some stuff he had laying around the house.

305
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,920
Now, of course, we couldn't fit it underneath the bonnet, so he wound up fitting it in the

306
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,200
wheel well, right behind what would typically be the mist lamp, which we remove.

307
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,440
Now, of course, that is extra special cooling onto the unit, so I very low probability

308
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
of anything happening.

309
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,600
But of course, more exciting is what it actually do.

310
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,480
And of course, it was great for me to, you know, to have to drive the 600 kilometers

311
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,360
back on Sunday to really get some measurements.

312
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,680
And I had already, and the way I measured was very simple, filled up the tank as far as it

313
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
will go.

314
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Of course, that's where there's a fudge factor.

315
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,800
I'm going to say at least one liter, it's a 60 liter tank, but, you know, one at one gas station,

316
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,800
the pump may switch off sooner, you know, and I tried to really get it as full as possible,

317
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:38,960
so I could actually see some gas coming up in the tank mouth there.

318
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,080
Then you just drive for a set of amount of kilometers, I did 100, and let's just presume

319
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:49,040
the, the, what would that be, the tuck on, not the tuck on, or the speedometer is correct,

320
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,520
and it's a digital system, so it actually measured 100 kilometers, and then, or whatever

321
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,520
it was, doesn't really matter if as long as it's close to 100 just to make it easy,

322
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,320
and then I'd stop another gas station, fill it up and see how many liters I had to put in.

323
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,760
Presuming what the tank, what the pump is reading out to me is accurate as well.

324
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:14,120
Without the booster, I'm getting a 10.5 kilometers to one liter of gasoline.

325
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,360
Now this is an overall, which is pretty consistent regardless of what speed.

326
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,720
Now I haven't done any city driving, this has just been on the highway, and I've tested

327
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,720
two speeds, 130 kilometers per hour, and 110 kilometers per hour.

328
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,880
Now at 100, so when I switch this, the booster on, I do have a switch in the glove compartment.

329
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:41,600
At 130 kilometers per hour, there was an improvement, and actually about a 10% improvement,

330
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,360
as I went from 10.5 kilometers per liter to 11.6.

331
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,000
So a little bit better than 10%, I kid you not.

332
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Now there's all kinds of stuff going on.

333
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,200
This is the first, the guys that I hooked up with, who have ever done it on an injection engine,

334
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,840
which of course also has a chip built into it.

335
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,320
I'm sure if we just messed around with a computer chip that we could get it to run

336
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:10,120
more efficiently, anyway, but just as a test, I then tried out at 110 kilometers per hour.

337
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:19,280
You're not going to believe this, 100, and I'm sorry, 13 kilometers to the liter.

338
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,760
13, do you realize how significant this is when you're paying a couple of bucks for, you

339
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,760
know, like four or five bucks for a, for gas, even if you're paying one buck, it's just

340
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,760
amazing.

341
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,920
Now, I haven't done any other tests other than the two I mentioned, because I did

342
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,960
actually have to get on the boat on time, but hopefully later this week, I'll have an

343
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,080
opportunity to try some town driving and see how it does.

344
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,960
Also, weather conditions can, of course, make all the difference.

345
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,040
It was very hot during these trials, so about 27 degrees centigrade.

346
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
Now it's much cooler.

347
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,320
I mean, it could give me better efficiency or worse efficiency.

348
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
I really don't know.

349
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,120
All I know is that according to this very simple test, which is the same way, I calculate

350
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,320
how much time I can fly, so I kind of trust the method of seeing, well, in this case,

351
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,720
I do hours for air planes, but now I did kilometers.

352
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,960
It actually works.

353
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,560
This thing actually works.

354
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,040
It's not even really surprised, you know, it makes so much sense.

355
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,240
Now, there's a lot of tweaking that can be done, and I'm going to keep you up the speed

356
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:32,160
as I progress with the trials, but I'm very, very excited that we've got something that

357
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,040
actually works.

358
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,440
So many people have said that you're crazy.

359
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,160
It can't, but I think these people are confusing efficiency with power efficiency,

360
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:47,360
which I'm sure it's not, because it's like pulling 30 amp pairs, amps off of the battery.

361
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,760
Just what seems to me, like a pretty simple physics exercise, you're just displacing

362
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,880
parts of the fuel flow with the different type of gas.

363
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,560
So obviously it's using a hydrogen, but the hydrogen, you can go for, you know, I don't

364
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,760
know, you can keep the thing on for probably 20 hours nonstop, and you won't have to refill

365
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
any water.

366
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,600
It's not actually condensating it out anywhere.

367
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,640
It's just producing hydrogen, fascinating shit.

368
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,720
But there's been, you know, today's show is going to be a little bit of a free wheel, because

369
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,760
it's just so much that it's come in, and I haven't even gotten through all the voicemail

370
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,200
comments that have come in, and I know that after when they show you guys definitely

371
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,560
have some stuff to talk about.

372
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,880
So I'll be doing that later on this week, a couple of things that did pop up on the radar.

373
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,880
This one was just phenomenal, and you see if I can, why can't I open this up for a second?

374
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,640
This is a, I was actually a boiling boiling story, and this just shows how crazy we've

375
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,120
gotten when it comes to, to terrorism, and well, you know, my favorite is security airport

376
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,120
security.

377
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,120
But now apparently the New York Yankees in case you hadn't read it, banned Sunblock at Yankees

378
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,800
Stadium to prevent terrorism on one of the hottest days of the year as well.

379
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:14,080
And then, of course, once you get into the stadium, a, a crappy Sunblock, SPF 15, a little,

380
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,080
you know, a little crappy bottle sold for, was it like five bucks, so you had to buy their

381
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,520
crappy Sunblock while yours was being taken away because, well, of terrorists, of course,

382
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:31,640
is this going too far or what, and that's, that's just nuts, and that's only the beginning.

383
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,880
Here's something that's circulating around the net that is quite disturbing.

384
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,720
Actually, I first got to it through, let me see.

385
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,040
There was someone pointed out to me, it was, uh, hold on.

386
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,280
Oh, I'm sure you've heard of this one.

387
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,120
If you're into some of the theory's project, Camelot.net.

388
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:05,320
And there was a link there to an interview that, uh, out there TV did with Lindsey Williams.

389
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,680
Now, when, uh, Lindsey Williams is the, uh, is the pastor we talked about.

390
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,560
There's a great video out there called the non-energy, the energy non-crisis.

391
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,800
He also wrote the book, and this is the guy who, um, two years ago, predicted that around

392
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:28,040
this time, we'd have four to five, um, dollars a gallon of gasoline, and he really went through

393
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,480
all the reasons why, and, and it was mainly because he says, look, the only people who really

394
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:43,880
control the oil price are, um, the, the world bank and, uh, other, uh, organization, similar

395
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,200
organizations, but primarily the world bank and the international monetary fund, and they do that

396
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,200
through a number of constructions, which he didn't really explain very well.

397
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,920
But when it came down to predicting stuff that was going to happen, that's why I love watching

398
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,480
stuff that is, you know, months or years old, he was spot on the money, and a lot of it had to

399
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,520
do with oil that we would have found that Alaska supposedly found that Alaska, uh, but we couldn't

400
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:12,120
go ahead and, and use that oil for ourselves, because that would break down the whole system of

401
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,560
Arab states, uh, selling oil to us and trading that in dollars, which of course is the deal that

402
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:23,480
Kissinger set up in the 70s, and which is, and enabled the United States to build up such a high

403
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,640
national debt, because that's all being purchased by, uh, by the Arabs as well. So, um,

404
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:39,880
May 29th, this interview on out there TV, uh, Lindsey Williams, first of all, his website

405
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,160
closed by the way. He says, uh, that, that happened under some specific threats, so he just, uh,

406
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,960
you know, he needs to protect himself and his family. But here's what he says, and I'm, uh,

407
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,480
a paraphrasing obviously, and this is on May 29th where he says this, the price of a barrel of oil

408
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:03,240
rise a little more. He said, $150 is what it would, what it should hit. Now, we came very close to $150,

409
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:10,600
about $14647. Then an announcement will be made of the discovery of huge oil reserves,

410
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,200
North, uh, Russia. Well, isn't that interesting? Didn't that just actually happen?

411
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,360
Didn't they just actually announce oil in the Arctic, which, of course, Russia is going to claim

412
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,720
part of and no one really owns it, but it's North of Russia? Yes. He also says that'll happen in

413
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,040
Indonesia, haven't had heard anything about that yet in the news. Now, um, here's his prediction,

414
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,680
these will flood the market with oil and the price of oil per barrel will drop down to $50.

415
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:41,000
Well, we're not there yet, but it has dropped down at least $20 more than 15% so we're close, uh,

416
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,960
you know, we're on our way down. Now, here's what Lindsey, and this, I mean, this guy's a minister,

417
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,200
a pastor. Yeah, he's not an economist. He's just a guy telling his story as he learned it and

418
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,560
is apparently he's totally clued into. He says that this $50 barrel oil will then bankrupt the

419
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,560
Arab nations who will be forced to dump their dollar reserves. Of course, I would have been the

420
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,200
same thing that would have happened if they opened up the oil in Alaska. Here it comes. That will

421
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,800
turn effectively bankrupt the US and America will see a financial collapse from which it will

422
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:20,600
take years to recover. Already on his way, I'd say the euro today is, uh, it's 63, it's 6.

423
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:32,520
Yeah, 63.5 cents to the euro. So we're moving up on $2. Am I saying that, right?

424
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,120
That gets out from confused. Anyway, it's almost at his low point. Let's put it that way. Yeah,

425
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,080
I guess we're going to be at the $2 euro if we keep going like this.

426
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:49,160
Then that will in turn effectively bankrupt. We are did that one following that will come.

427
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,360
I love this. The North American Union and of course, we'll need new money since the dollar

428
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:01,320
will collapse the Amaro. So if you followed along with a show or any area, you've probably heard about

429
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,840
the North American Union. I mean, mainstream has reported on this as well, which would contain

430
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,760
of Canada, North America and Mexico. And this, you know, this currency the Amaro has been mentioned

431
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:18,120
before. Additionally, Williams said that he was told something will happen shortly before the

432
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:25,000
election, which will ensure that McCain becomes president. So that's pretty interesting. And I

433
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,720
actually registered and I paid some money to be able to see this out there TV. Wasn't a video

434
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,800
into it was a phone interview. But then I got word of something that was not very widely reported,

435
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:42,360
which relates to the Pfizer bill, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and how that was handled

436
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:51,240
in the Senate. Now, I'm looking for a home on a second because this is drove me nuts when

437
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:57,960
all this stuff started to come together. Here we go. So Dennis Cassinać actually, he's the Democrat.

438
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:05,000
I think he's one of the only Democrats that Dr. Ron Paul likes. He made a big stink in a big

439
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,600
objection on March 13th because there were calls for a secret meeting of the house.

440
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,200
A closed door meeting. Let me just see if I have some details on that. As I said, I'm kind of doing

441
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,040
everything on the fly here. So I've got my links all lined up, but still got to get it all set up. Here we go.

442
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:32,200
This is where's this from? How think and post? Okay, that'll do. The house on Friday and this is

443
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:39,800
from this is March 14th. Okay. So this was about the Pfizer bill. And of course, this was about

444
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:48,120
as far as we know about granting immunity to the phone companies for essentially

445
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:57,320
conspiring with the government to place illegal phone taps all in the name of the war against

446
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:03,720
terror right after 9.11. And this is the thing that Obama said he was opposed to and then later

447
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:10,600
went back and voted for the for the new Pfizer bill, which as far as I understand,

448
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:18,200
gives the telecommunications for immunity. But the crazy thing was, is that there was a call for

449
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,280
this closed door meeting, which was secret. And so Dennis Cassinać objected, which gave him the

450
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,800
opportunity to get all kinds of information on record. And you can just go to YouTube and find all these

451
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,920
different different pieces. I mean, this was about 20 minutes of him talking and objecting and

452
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:41,240
really some good Donald info, which I have not seen anywhere on mainstream news pretty much the same as

453
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:49,320
the as what's going on right now with the impeachment trials. You know, just not seeing that anywhere.

454
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:55,400
So I guess we might as well expose that as much as possible. Now back to the 13th. So a lot of

455
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,880
senators said, you know, I'm not going to participate in this Cassinać said, I'm not going to be a part

456
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,520
of that meeting because of course you're held a secrecy and it's an undemocratic process.

457
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,080
This, by the way, is only half of this would be the fourth time in over 100 years that a secret

458
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,680
session like this has been called. So of course, everyone would kind of like to know what the secret

459
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,880
session was all about. Now coming out of Australia is interesting. A lot of news like this seems to be

460
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,720
coming out of Australia just recently and I'm not quite sure why and I don't know if I should be

461
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:34,520
suspicious or not, but I have read this in several different places. So you're going to love this.

462
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:40,840
So on March 13th, 2008, according to sources, so not saying that I buy into this and it's all the way,

463
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,920
you know, the way this has written just, you know, it's placed too much into all kinds of conspiracy

464
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:53,080
theorist plans, but it actually was not just information they were given. It was a scheduled plan

465
00:23:53,080 --> 00:24:00,040
of events. Here's what apparently was discussed in the closed door session. The imminent collapse

466
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:07,000
of the U.S. economy to occur sometime in late 2008. So that does kind of corroborate there with

467
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,560
what Lindsay Williams is saying. Then the imminent collapse of the U.S. government finances sometime

468
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:19,160
in mid 2009. Quite honestly, that one I think we can pretty much see coming. I mean, we've

469
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:26,040
opened up the door for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and, you know, banks are going out,

470
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,600
literally, even though they've raised new money, their losses are bigger than the new money,

471
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,880
they've raised. I'm not making this up. This is in the financial times today. There's a huge issue

472
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,960
with banking. And now we're going from the subprime market to the prime market, which by

473
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,120
admission of the bankers themselves is, quote, terrible again, sourced from the financial times today.

474
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,240
So what else was discussed? What else, what other information was given in this closed

475
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,680
door meeting? The possibility of civil war inside the United States as a result of the collapse.

476
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:02,280
Because, of course, our money would be valueless in the rest of the world. I don't really know what

477
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:08,280
happens when the one currency collapses, but it's a can't be good. Then the advanced

478
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:15,160
round-ups of insurgent U.S. citizens, as you know, anyone could be called an enemy combatant

479
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:20,920
under the Patriot Act. George Bush and still that. So no, anyone can be locked up. So anyone who

480
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,120
was, quote, likely to move against the government will be locked up in here, comes the detention

481
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,480
of those rounded up at the Rex 84 camps, which have been constructed throughout the United States.

482
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,440
I've heard a lot about these Rex 84 camps. Never really seen any good pictures.

483
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,560
Talked about this with Johnson Devorak on Noah Gendo over the weekend, and he said,

484
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,920
you know, he was skeptical about that. So I don't know too much about him, but of course,

485
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,080
I've heard the conspiracies about these camps, internment camps that are just ready to take.

486
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,640
I guess, insurgent U.S. citizens board likely to move against the government. That would be

487
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,880
probably yours truly, my friends. Then the possibility of public retaliation against members of

488
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,840
Congress, because of the collapses, so they discussed the location of safe facilities,

489
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,720
from members of Congress, and their families to reside during massive civil unrest. And then

490
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,160
the necessary and unavoidable merger of the U.S. with Canada and Mexico establishing the North

491
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:22,040
American Union and the final point, the issuance of new currency called the Amaro for all three

492
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:31,000
nations as a final economic solution. So here's two different sources, pretty much saying the same

493
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,400
thing coming from totally different vantage points. Of course, I have no idea how this stuff

494
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,200
in Australia has been sourced, but you know what, I'd be no Australia. I like those guys down there.

495
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,200
And the gals too. So I'm sure that they're not just bullshit and around. It looks like some pretty

496
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,520
serious reporting is going on, and the someone is doing some pretty serious leakage to the press.

497
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,600
And maybe only the Australian press or the ones that will actually have the guts to print this

498
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,440
stuff. Who knows? We probably going to a hell of a hand basket. I mean, we seem like we're

499
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,600
going to credit cards and spend the rest of their lives paying 18%. Oh, I'm sorry. I hit that kind

500
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:10,040
of without an intro. This reminded me that I wanted to play a piece from a guy who I unfortunately

501
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,280
never met, but of course, passed away just recently. George Carlin on what I just called George

502
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,320
Carlin on the New World Order. It's just on something because 1250. And they didn't like it

503
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,600
when they got at home anyway. Not too bright folks, not too fucking bright. But if you talk to one

504
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,000
on about this, if you isolate one, I'm just sitting down rationally. You talk to him about the low IQs

505
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,920
and the dumb behavior and the bad decisions. Right away, they start talking about education.

506
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,480
That's the big answer to every day. Education. There's to be more money for education. We need more

507
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,960
more books, more teachers, more classroom, more schools. But we need more testing for the kids.

508
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,360
He said, oh well, you know, we've tried all of that and the kids still can't pass the test.

509
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,680
So I don't sure about that. We're going to lower the passing grades. That's what they're doing.

510
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,640
A lot of these schools, now they lower the passing grades, some more kids can pass.

511
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,240
More kids pass, the school will look good. Everybody's happy. The IQ of the country slips

512
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,160
another two or three points. I'm pretty soon. All you'll need to get into college is a fucking

513
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:07,960
pencil. Got a pencil. Get the fucking there. It's physics. Then everyone wonders why 17

514
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,240
other countries graduate more scientists than we do. Education. Politicians know that word

515
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,440
they use it on you. Politicians have traditionally hidden behind three things. The flag,

516
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:24,440
the Bible, and children. No child left behind. No child left behind. Oh really? Well, it wasn't

517
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,240
long ago. You were talking about giving kids a head start. Head start left behind. Someone's losing

518
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,800
fucking ground here. But there's a reason. There's a reason for this. There's a reason

519
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:41,560
education sucks. It's the same reason that it will never, ever, ever be fixed. It's never going

520
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:47,080
to get any better. Don't look for it. Be happy with what you got. Because the owners of this

521
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:55,880
country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now. The big wealthy, the real owners,

522
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,760
the big wealthy business interests, the control things and make all the important decisions.

523
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,320
They get the politicians. They're they're in irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give

524
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:11,720
you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners.

525
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,720
They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the

526
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,160
corporations. They've long since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state

527
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,920
houses, the city halls. They've got the judges in their back pockets. And they own all the big

528
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,560
media, media, all the big media companies where they control just about all of the news and

529
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:35,000
information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every

530
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,440
year lobbying. Lobbing. So get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more

531
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,000
for themselves unless for everybody else. But I'll tell you what they don't want. They don't want

532
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,280
a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don't want well-informed, well-educated

533
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:58,840
people capable of critical thinking. That doesn't help them. That's against their interest. That's right.

534
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,480
You know something? They don't want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table

535
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,840
to figure out how badly they're getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30

536
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,120
fucking years ago. They don't want that. You know what they want? They want obedient workers,

537
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:17,320
obedient workers. People who are just smart enough to run their machines and do the paperwork

538
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,600
and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shitty jobs with the lower pay,

539
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,480
the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing passion that disappears

540
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,200
the minute you go to collect it. And now they're coming for your social security money. They

541
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,240
want your fucking retirement money. They want it back. So they can give it to their criminal

542
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,240
friends on Wall Street. And you know something? They'll get it. They'll get it all from you.

543
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,760
Sooner or later, because they own this fucking place. It's a big club. And you ain't in it.

544
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,240
You and I are not in the big club. By the way, it's the same big club. They used to be

545
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,080
chover the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long being

546
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,920
over the head of their media. It's only what to believe, what to think and what to buy.

547
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,040
The table is tilted, folks. The game is rigged. And nobody seems to notice.

548
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,920
Nobody seems to care. Good on us. Hard working people. White collar blue collar doesn't matter.

549
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:15,240
What color shirts you have on? Good on us. Hard working people. Continue. These are people

550
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,200
of modest means. Continue to elect these rich cock suckers. They don't give a fucking about

551
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,360
them. They don't give a fucking about you. They don't give a fucking about you. They don't care

552
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:35,720
about you at all. At all. At all. No. Nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care.

553
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,200
That's what the owner's count on. The fact that America's will

554
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,960
will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red-white and blue

555
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,760
dick that's being jammed up their assholes every day. Because the owners of this country

556
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,960
know the truth, it's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.

557
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,240
Dead men don't lie. Okay. By the way, sorry for the erroneous sound effects there. That was

558
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,120
uh, something I couldn't change while I was running. Yeah, George Carla Man, he knew what was going

559
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,680
on. Boy, do we miss him? We could use him right now, although he's left us up quite a legacy that

560
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:14,360
we need to delve into continuously and not forget what he stood for. Did you see that YouTube

561
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,400
video? By the way, I'm sure it's been on the news everywhere of Bush, a recording at some private

562
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,840
fundraiser and he actually says, could everyone turn off the T.K. TV cameras? The audio

563
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,360
is shitty, so I don't even want to play it for you. But he sits there and he says, you know,

564
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,800
this problem in Wall Street is Wall Street got drunk and now they got a hangover and they got

565
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:37,480
us sober up. But housing crisis, there's no housing crisis. Loris is looking for a house in

566
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:46,040
was it either Houston or Austin? All right. So if you haven't seen it, go to YouTube,

567
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,640
visit the top of the list. This really pissed me off. That's the first of all, you got to,

568
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,960
you got to wonder, is the guy really so stupid to think that when he says, turn off the cameras,

569
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:02,200
turn off the TV cameras that people won't recording with cell phone cameras. Does he really think

570
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,680
that? Or is that or is he smart? Is he so smart that he thinks, hey, now someone's definitely

571
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,880
going to record it. Then I don't know. But if that is his explanation of what's happening right now

572
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:18,440
in the financial world, bring back the nylon Christ. It's not a case of Wall Street got drunk.

573
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:26,440
Usually he even said using those fancy financial instruments. My god, man, this is not what happened.

574
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,520
That's a vet. I mean, how the people who were sitting there in that room who were giving him

575
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,720
thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars, do you think they're that stupid?

576
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,480
Which actually kind of brings me back to my thinking that maybe maybe he said this on purpose.

577
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,640
So that he could get this message out to the people that this is, this is the real, this is what's

578
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:51,800
really going on. Folks, here's George Bush explaining it to his buddies jokingly, that is not what

579
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:57,160
happened. This has been systematic and structural. And people have been warning against it for 20

580
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,920
years. How about Dr. Ron Paul? 20 years, the man's been warning against this crap. And here we are.

581
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,480
Someone's got to pay for it now. And you know what? It's going to be us. And then the comment

582
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:14,440
about the housing situation. Hold on a second. So he talks about Laura getting a house

583
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,040
for after they leave the White House. What happened to the Crawford Ranch? Which by the way,

584
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,840
he bought just before he moved into the White House. So this is a ranch where I've never seen

585
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,840
cattle or they're supposed to be a working ranch. What does he do? Move brush around.

586
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,680
Whenever whenever some dignitarious hanging out with him, wherever there's a photo up,

587
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,080
clearly this thing is just a prop in the whole game. It's not really his house.

588
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,680
Pop! So now he's going to go live in some huge house.

589
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,720
Well, hundreds of thousands of people around him are losing their homes. And his joke and about it,

590
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,280
just makes me want to be sick. Really does.

591
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,040
Hi, Adam and Matt from Gamesweasel. On this week's show, we review Sifra Smash Bros. Ball on the

592
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,600
week. We also take a look at the new Prince Casper game on the 360. We've got the brand new

593
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:10,760
Tomb Raider Underworld trailer and footage from E3 a Gaze of War 2. That's all at Gamesweasel.com.

594
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,360
Alright, Matt, thank you. That shows really taken off. By the way, if you haven't seen it yet,

595
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,360
check out the video version of Gamesweasel.btpodshow.com.

596
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,400
So I have a trip to San Francisco coming up. And of course it's interesting. I'm going to be there

597
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:31,080
just as all of this stuff is predicted to happen. I could be picked up as an enemy combatant.

598
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:38,600
And honestly, there is a little twinge of anxiety in the back of my mind about being in the

599
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:45,400
states in August of September with all of these predictions going on. But okay, you know, so be it.

600
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,640
But I do want to try something new. Because of course, as you know, for the past 10 times that have entered

601
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:59,160
the United States, I've been stopped for secondary and tertiary search and discovery and questioning.

602
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:07,160
It's very unfriendly and unwelcome to have this when I'm going back to my own country.

603
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,560
Particularly because the Freedom of Information Act requests I'm supposed to ask. As per the

604
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:18,360
form, I was handed. Has resulted in nothing. I'm still on the database. No one can change it. It's a mess.

605
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,480
And now this didn't start until I got my new passport. Because the old one's basically filled

606
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:29,000
up to the brim, even got extra pages put in. And the new passport has an RFID chip in it,

607
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,840
which they always slide the minute they slide that thing into the reader man. It's like, whoa,

608
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,120
hold on. It's big stripe across your landing card. Please go to secondary.

609
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:45,480
So I'm wondering, is there a way to disable the chip that would at least be plausible just to see what

610
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,840
happens? Of course, you know, they'll have my passport. So they have to enter the number manually.

611
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,880
I'm just wondering if it's a separate system, if we'll make any difference.

612
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:57,400
But I have to have the chip not working. I know the easiest way probably is to throw it in the

613
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,840
microwave for 5 or 10 seconds. But that may actually burn a hole in it. And I don't want to do that.

614
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:08,280
So can I do this with a magnet? Is there any way that I assure fire away that I can disable the chip?

615
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,800
Just to see what's going to happen. And I'm going to have to get a new passport. I don't know who knows

616
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:17,000
what will happen. But something that at least is plausible. And let's test the system. Let's see,

617
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,160
yeah, let's see what comes of it. 10 foil hat wears out there. Let me know, drop me in a line.

618
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,160
Adam at www.mevio.com.

619
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:40,360
Hey Adam, how are you doing? I'm doing great. I'm sorry about Friday's number 131. Yes.

620
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,600
And we're going to start right away with intro number one.

621
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,140
Hey mate, I'm so excited to see what happens.

622
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,480
Creusy. Chris. Isaac. wag lid game.

623
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,440
Fight off the bat. Yeah, we didn't do a football Friday so we got to roll this out today.

624
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,200
Alright y'all number two. Number two.

625
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,060
Little crazy seal.

626
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,960
And this is number three.

627
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,960
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, see you see me as a factor, you're gonna make me sweat.

628
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
YAH!

629
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
What is this a 90's vibe today?

630
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,960
89, 90?

631
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
Probably?

632
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Let's see how we did.

633
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,960
I'm going for six out of six.

634
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
And times seven, these are the answers.

635

And people actually do go to hittest.mefio.com and and purchase the tracks.

708
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
It's g. It's a great system.

709
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,960
Instead of mucking around trying to track people illegally sharing your shit record companies.

710
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
Look at some new models, dudes.

711
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,960
All right.

712
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,960
I got some more cool stuff from the world of the used to be free.

713
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,960
Uh, this is great.

714
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,960
Headline as it's loading here.

715
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,960
This is from the telegraph in the UK.

716
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,960
Passengers at British airports to be fingerprinted.

717
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,960
Oh, yes.

718
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:14,960
The home offices border and immigration agency is confirmed that it's considering forcing airport operators to introduce the measures to increase security.

719
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,960
Yeah.

720
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,960
Oh, man.

721
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,960
So if you're traveling internationally, you'll have to be fingerprint fingerprinted at, uh, I guess he throw a

722
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,960
gateway, or even stance it.

723
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,960
And I wonder if international also includes the European Union.

724
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,960
Who cares?

725
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,960
It's another step.

726
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,960
It's just another step on the way to, well, whatever the plan is.

727
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,960
And this one was very interesting.

728
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,960
Um, if you like conspiracies,

729
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,960
um,

730
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:50,960
there is now thinking coming from the search and rescue team as well as the insurance company

731
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,960
who did an eight month probe into the mystery of Steve Fossett's death.

732
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,960
Steve Fossett, of course.

733
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,960
Uh, the aviator, um, who has flown around the world nonstop.

734
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,960
Uh, he took off from, uh,

735
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,960
the, uh,

736
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,960
Hilton, uh,

737
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,960
Baron Hilton's flying and ranch and Reno on the action.

738
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,960
My birthday.

739
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
That's why I remember it.

740
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
Uh, September third, uh,

741
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
what are we coming up on a full year now, I guess?

742
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,960
Or is it now two years?

743
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
God, I don't even know how long ago it was.

744
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,960
Uh, took off and, uh,

745
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,960
and was never found again.

746
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,960
And, uh, you know,

747
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,960
read some of the quotes here,

748
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
despite a massive search for Fossett and his

749
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,960
Velancas hitabria super to cathlan,

750
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,960
which is, uh,

751
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
uh, an airplane.

752
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,960
It's funny.

753
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,960
They mentioned something about this.

754
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,960
No trace of either has been ever been final tenant.

755
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,960
Colonel Cynthia Rhine of the US Civil Air Patrol,

756
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,960
who was involved in the operation from the start said,

757
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,960
quote,

758
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,960
I've been doing this search and rescue stuff for 14 years.

759
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,960
Fossett should have been found.

760
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,960
It's not like we didn't have our eyes open.

761
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,960
We found six other planes while we were looking for him.

762
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,960
We're pretty good at what we do.

763
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,960
Rhine believes Fossett, quote,

764
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,960
may have faked his own death due to personal problems

765
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,960
or fears about his business dealings,

766
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,960
explains the telegraph.

767
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,960
Uh, and then Lloyds of London goes on to say that,

768
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,960
uh, you know, they're stomped and, uh,

769
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,960
well, there's a 25 million,

770
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,960
fifty dollar,

771
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,960
fifty million dollar payout.

772
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,960
Uh, but he finds it, uh,

773
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,960
baffling and, uh,

774
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,960
that, uh, they haven't found either Fossett or the aircraft.

775
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,960
And he noted,

776
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,960
the superdicathlon aircraft is constructed from a steel and wood frame

777
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,960
and actually covered in fabric,

778
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,960
making it easy to dismantle.

779
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,960
Wow, there's a conspiracy for you, huh?

780
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,960
Just thought it'd throw that one out for you.

781
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,960
And, uh,

782
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,960
a good friend Ray is, uh,

783
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,960
is back in the fold.

784
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,960
And, uh,

785
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,960
it looks like he's got an item that he wants to produce,

786
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,960
I guess every week or whenever he feels like it for,

787
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,960
uh, for all you chuckle heads.

788
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,960
It's, uh,

789
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,960
it's kind of an ego thing for me.

790
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,960
I like it very much and,

791
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,960
and I really appreciate the work that's

792
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,960
Ray putting it in,

793
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,960
that Ray is putting into it.

794
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,960
And also gives me, you know,

795
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,960
a chance to play,

796
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,960
indeed a song that is the soundtrack to my life.

797
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,960
So here it is,

798
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,960
episode number two

799
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,960
in the soundtrack to my life.

800
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,960
1986,

801
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,960
here's Ray on the Charlie.

802
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,960
soundtrack to my life.

803
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

804
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,960
The soundtrack to my life.

805
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,960
Let's take a look at the landscape.

806
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,960
On a road trip through your life.

807
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,960
In his first decade in the Netherlands,

808
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,960
and after a time working in Dutch barric radio

809
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,960

810
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,960
and cut his big bragging broadcasting

00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,960
as the host of the witty pop music television program

812
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,960
Countdown.

813
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,960
He also started several other radio and television programs

814
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,960
for the Dutch broadcast station for Raleigha.

815
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,960
In 1986,

816
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,960
Adam Scourier in the Netherlands moved

817
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,960
with two years from being a local kid

818
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,960
from nest on the host old

819
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,960
to an original celebrity in Holland.

820
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,960
And he parts of Europe.

821
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,960
He was living in the apartment in the south of Amsterdam.

822
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,960
The expensive area of our Dutch capital city

823
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,960
and Adam was breeding media and entertainment.

824
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,960
It was the year in which Adam started

825
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,960
a secret affair with the Lady Patricia

826
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,960
had to deal with the changes in his life

827
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,960
from being a nobody into a European

828
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,960
celebrity.

829
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,960
He performed on stage with his lifefox

830
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,960
and a meatball and co-miconjection

831
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,960
to give him some human advice.

832
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,960
Michael, could you tell us

833
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,960
you're in your accent?

834
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,960
You're in your accent?

835
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,960
I will.

836
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,960
I just need to go.

837
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,960
I will.

838
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,960
I will do my thing.

839
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,960
Do you have all your Disney characters

840
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,960
there with you in the tank?

841
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,960
I don't know.

842
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,960
I don't know when I before I go to sleep.

843
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,960
I put on my Mickey Mouse suit.

844
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,960
I'll come along, Adam.

845
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,960
This is no Michael Jackson.

846
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,960
This is what it was.

847
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,960
It sounds like my life.

848
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,960
And it was also the waterboss.

849
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,960
It was very productive and refined

850
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,960
the new sounding bridge rock and roll

851
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,960
the whole of the bridge is number 26.

852
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,960
The way you want me to touch up for you

853
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,960
and curse.

854
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,960
I'll dress you my body.

855
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,960
I'll dress you down and make you happy.

856
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,960
The way you kiss me.

857
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,960
I'll picture the rainbow.

858
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,960
You held it in your hands.

859
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,960
I had a flashes.

860
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,960
You saw the land.

861
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,960
I wandered out in the world for years.

862
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,960
But you just stayed in your room.

863
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,960
I saw the present.

864
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:49,960
You saw the whole of the moon.

865
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,960
You held out in your hands.

866
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,960
I wandered out in your hands.

867
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,960
You saw the whole of the stars.

868
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,960
And you know how it feels to reach too high.

869
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,960
Too far.

870
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,960
Too soon.

871
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,960
You saw the whole of the moon.

872
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,960
I was granted.

873
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:28,960
When you fill the skies, I want some boundaries back to you.

874
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:37,960
You cut too late, I saw a ring dirty valley.

875
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:45,960
Yes, I'll bring it to you. I saw the presents.

876
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,960
You saw a hole.

877
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,960
I spoke about wings.

878
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,960
You just flew.

879
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,960
I wonder that I guess that I tried.

880
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:31,960
You just knew I saw.

881
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:41,960
When you saw that I saw a ring dirty valley.

882
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,960
Yes, I'll bring it to you.

883
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:56,960
I saw a ring dirty valley.

884
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:04,960
You cut too late, I saw a ring dirty valley.

885
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,960
Yes, I'll bring it to you.

886
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,960
Yes, I'll bring it to you.

887
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,960
I'll bring it to you.

888
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,960
You try to find the stars, play the options for tears.

889
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,960
It's like a place, a rainbow, a city of the world's stars.

890
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,960
Every stranger's dream and vision, I'm gonna need the stars.

891
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,960
You can find all that I want.

892
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,960
When did yourselves leave you like it for me?

893
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:53,960
Lazing your chance, I am too far, too soon.

894
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,960
You saw a hole.

895
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:07,960
I'll bring it to you.

896
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,960
I'll bring it to you.

897
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,960
I'll bring it to you.

898
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,960
I'll bring it to you.

899
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,960
I'll bring it to you.

900
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:35,960
I'll bring it to you.

901
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,960
I'll bring it to you.

902
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:52,960
I'll bring it to you.

903
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,960
Thanks man, great way to put some more licensed music in the show under the fair use

904
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,960
doctrine.

905
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,960
Yeah, water boys, I don't know.

906
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,960
It's funny because that is definitely one that I'd like to put on the soundtrack to my

907
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,960
life.

908
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,960
I think it was kind of because we're in the middle of the synth pop, the Durand Durand

909
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:16,960
era of 1986 and all of a sudden here was this very melodic piano based.

910
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,960
It was a real radio record.

911
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,960
It sounded so good.

912
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,960
I love the lyric.

913
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,960
You saw the hole of the moon.

914
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,960
It's romantic.

915
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,960
It can be put in different contexts.

916
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,960
I don't really have a direct memory associated with it.

917
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,960
I have to say, except it was just a great time in my life and I was feeling great

918
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,960
and I wasn't loved.

919
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,960
Yes, with a lady Patricia even at the time.

920
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,960
Yeah, thank you.

921
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,960
Anything you guys put together.

922
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,960
I love to play that.

923
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,960
You're kidding me.

924
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,960
If you put anything you want and I'll use it.

925
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,960
Just try and keep it within reasonable length.

926
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,960
With the song is fantastic.

927
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,960
Really liked it.

928
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,960
Okay.

929
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,960
Just a couple more things before I get out of here.

930
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,960
Edgar Mitchell is an astronaut who was the sixth man to walk on the moon.

931
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,960
And guess what?

932
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,960
Again, another article from down under.

933
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,960
This is from news.com.au.

934
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,960
Not quite sure who runs this.

935
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,960
That's even a Murdoch thing.

936
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,960
I don't know.

937
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,960
Yeah, it makes sense, wouldn't it?

938
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,960
Well, anyway, on a radio show,

939
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,960
correct radio show of all types of programs.

940
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,960
How cool is that?

941
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,960
Dr. Edgar Mitchell who's now 77.

942
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,960
And you'll see a lot of these guys, if you look at the disclosure project.

943
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,960
A lot of these guys were getting up there in their 70s and 80s.

944
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,960
They're, you know, the now they're starting to just say anything they want to

945
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,960
because I believe probably their non-disclosures have expired.

946
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,960
But also they're nearly into their life and they want to get information out.

947
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,960
So he's part of the Apollo 14 mission says aliens exist.

948
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,960
He says extraterrestrials have visited Earth on several occasions.

949
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,960
But the alien contact has been repeatedly covered up by governments for six decades.

950
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:04,960
He says the real life ET's were similar to the traditional image of a small frame large eyes

951
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,960
and head or the grays, as they're known.

952
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,960
He went on to claim that our technology is not nearly as sophisticated as theirs.

953
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,960
But had they been hostile he warned we would have been gone by now.

954
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,960
It's just great.

955
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,960
So we've got all these people coming out.

956
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,960
We've got, I mean, is it just all the conspiracy theories are coming together at the same time?

957
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,960
I'm not, I'm not the only one talking about this.

958
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,960
I, you know, it's out there.

959
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,960
My daughter came home.

960
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,960
She said, you know, is it this party dad?

961
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,960
And there's this really, really cute guy who was a male model and thought he would be pretty

962
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,960
vapid and empty.

963
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,960
And also he starts talking about David Iken about the new world order.

964
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,960
And so, you know, kids are talking about it too.

965
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,960
I guess that's good.

966
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,960
I mean, certainly something's going on.

967
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,960
You can't deny that.

968
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:57,960
So now to have these guys come out and just one in a slew of many to say, hey, damn.

969
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,960
You know, there's something going on here that we should be knowing about.

970
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,960
And I'm like when it, the start on some of the stories that I've been hearing.

971
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:12,960
It's kind of confusing time from me, honestly, because I do think about these things.

972
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,960
And as I said, you know, I'm getting ready to travel and I'm thinking about could it really be true?

973
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,960
Could, could the dollar really collapse or will it be some kind of UFO visit?

974
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,960
Could that be staged by the government?

975
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,960
I mean, you know, you've got to be careful not going down the rabbit hole too far.

976
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,960
But just staying with the stuff that I kind of understand the financials, we're in deep deep trouble.

977
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,960
Deep Kim Shea is what I'd call it.

978
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:41,960
And then one other thing, which a chuckle had pointed out to me, and I'm still researching this.

979
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,960
You know, in this, for this is for the folks who live in the European Union,

980
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,960
but those of you in the States may be interested to listen how this works.

981
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:54,960
So we have this Lisbon Treaty, which was basically a rewrite of the European Constitution,

982
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:01,960
which was voted down by France and the Netherlands, who both had referenda on the topic.

983
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,960
So neither of those countries were able to vote on the re-worked version.

984
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,960
Basically, their representatives voted it in, ratified it.

985
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,960
This has already happened in 21 of the 27 countries, as you know, Ireland said no.

986
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,960
So this thing is off the table, but man, these guys are really trying to drive it home and make it happen.

987
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,960
And particularly Sarcosi, who is now the president for the next six months of the European Union.

988
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,960
And of course, President of France is really taking the seriously.

989
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,960
And he's trying to figure out how to make this go into effect next year.

990
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:37,960
Anyway, even if it means leaving Ireland behind in a so-called, you know, slow speed Europe.

991
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:43,960
So along with this document, our number of protocols.

992
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,960
And they're kind of like a denda.

993
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,960
You know, it's a contract.

994
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,960
This thing is unreadable.

995
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,960
I've struggled through it.

996
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,960
I've spoken to politicians who I can just tell by their answers.

997
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,960
Haven't read it at all or certainly haven't given it the attention they should have.

998
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,960
And particularly when you look at all these extra documents you got to bring in like the protocols.

999
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:12,960
And one of these protocols refers to another European Union, namely the European Atomic Energy Union.

1000
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,960
Now there's only a handful of countries that are member of this.

1001
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:27,960
But even if you go to the Wikipedia page and you look at all of the, all the treaties, you'll see that the European or your Atomic as in your European Atomic Union.

1002
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:34,960
It kind of sits on top of all the other treaties, which means it's in effect for a long, long time and will be for a long time.

1003
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,960
It was written in 1965.

1004
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,960
So there's a couple of countries, you know, some of the big ones, including the Netherlands.

1005
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:46,960
And I don't even, I think either France or Germany was not a part of it.

1006
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,960
But it had like six or seven countries.

1007
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:55,960
And the protocol in the Lisbon Treaty, which if it goes into effect, if it's ratified and whatever they figure out,

1008
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,960
let's just say it goes into effect or once kind of acting as if it is anyway.

1009
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,960
And this protocol will also become law.

1010
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:10,960
And the protocol states that the members of the European Atomic Energy Union will have the following specific.

1011
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:23,960
And it's specifically states that not only will the governments or the people working for the governments, the invaluable.

1012
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:24,960
You understand what I'm saying?

1013
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:29,960
So you can't do, you can't serve a warrant to search the government premises.

1014
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,960
You can't look in the archives of government documents.

1015
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:39,960
The people working for the government have many of this, including their spouses have many of the same privileges.

1016
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,960
It's protocol number number 36, by the way.

1017
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,960
I was just looking for a link during Ray on the Charlie couldn't find it that quickly.

1018
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,960
But I know it by heart because I've read it so many times.

1019
00:58:50,960 --> 00:59:00,960
The really scary thing is that these same privileges now will be extended to the European Central Bank and something called the European Investment Bank.

1020
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,960
Both which, well, the kind of like federal reserves.

1021
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:15,960
So I mean, does this have anything to do with a democratic process where you are not allowed to look in the archives of your federal reserve bank, the European Central Bank?

1022
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,960
Is that democratic?

1023
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:27,960
If the people who work for the European Central Bank, like, you know, Trishay, which is kind of our version of Bernanke, if he can't be held accountable, how does that work?

1024
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,960
Why does the European Investment Bank not have to pay any taxes on anything?

1025
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:40,960
The someone's making money off of that because they're raising money in the capital markets, charging interest, somewhere someone's getting paid something.

1026
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,960
So that's let's call that homework, my fellow chucklehead. So let's look into that a little bit more.

1027
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:55,960
I got a quick upload to do so I'll search around for at least that link so I can get the show out before I have to hurry on off to London because I got another meeting.

1028
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:05,960
Yeah, remember Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, living in two worlds. Yep, that's me. So I have something for my British friends who are losing more liberties every day.

1029
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:14,960
Now, according to the Terrorism Act section 44, you can be forbidden from filming in a public place.

1030
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:27,960
It's true section 44 and all the constables at their own discretion may invoke it. And so if you're filming something on the street, which could be a protest or could be just some cute girls walking by.

1031
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:36,960
A police officer, a constable may come up to you and force you to stop that under section 44, the Terrorism Act. How do you like them apples?

1032
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:42,960
So there's something else that happened very recently, which I think eventually will affect all of us in the European Union.

1033
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:51,960
What you are and are not allowed to say to certain people, thank goodness we have Victoria Wood who made up a little song about what's going on.

1034
01:00:51,960 --> 01:01:01,960
Now, I'm going to finish with a couple of songs and I wrote this first one because I read this thing in a paper that said there was going to be an EEC ruling that we're not going to be allowed to use the word specky for eyes.

1035
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,960
Like at work, you won't be allowed to call somebody specky for eyes.

1036
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:11,960
Now, I don't know if it's going to be like being in a non-smoking building. I don't know if you can take them around the back or into the car park and call them specky for eyes.

1037
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:23,960
But within a, within a work situation, you know, it won't be correct and it had a whole list of things we're not going to be allowed to say. There was specky for eyes, fatty, spotty, lardos.

1038
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:31,960
And right to the bottom, I had this little word that I use all the time out of Africa. I can't use that word, how can I describe that sort of a person.

1039
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:37,960
So I've written the song, sort of, gets me out of the difficulty, which just use the word in question. So I hope it doesn't offend anybody.

1040
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,960
I don't mind if I offend somebody.

1041
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:51,960
I never wanted to say nigg. No, I was never keen on pecky.

1042
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:59,960
Or capital is lackey. I thought was rather tacky. It was never on my lips.

1043
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:07,960
But there's a term I'm rather fond of, and to use it, I do hanker.

1044
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:23,960
It's not hurting, cast a blanket. A little word is wanker.

1045
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:33,960
As a term it's attitude. They say it's not correct. It's got to go. They say it's too dark.

1046
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:45,960
Well, I don't know if it is never heard, then how convey. That very special word, another way.

1047
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:59,960
He is a little self-abusive. His mits are always in his nicks.

1048
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:07,960
He prefers to jiggle solo. He prefers his unlast roll-o-o.

1049
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:17,960
To a bad of began micks. He writes for masturbation weakly, when opportunity occurs.

1050
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:25,960
If you're buying him a present, his and hers things can be pleasant, but don't bother rapping hers.

1051
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:31,960
I never wanted to say fault, face. I don't find our soul to appealing.

1052
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:37,960
He depends with whom you're dealing, and it's just a personal feeling, but I don't like how it sounds.

1053
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:43,960
But political correctness has taken hold, just like a kanker.

1054
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:49,960
I don't like to nick a tanker and run down the stupid wanker who was put it out of bounds.

1055
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:59,960
All right, it's not correct. I'm out of touch, but please reflect. It's so much.

1056
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,960
Are there some other ways? It's such a shame.

1057
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:13,960
Is there another phrase that means the same? His scrotum isn't used to strangers.

1058
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,960
There are no condoms on his shelf.

1059
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:33,960
When his tones caress and soften, when he asks you come here often, he's talking to himself.

1060
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:41,960
He'll never need a bigger dress, book, because all his friends are in his flies.

1061
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:50,960
I think may sometimes disappear, but it won't drag you around, Ikea, or by your polyester tie.

1062
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:55,960
And if it's not correct, it's awfully cute.

1063
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:02,960
I feel I'm afraid yet, a substitute, though it may make you squirm.

1064
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:09,960
You find it strong, to use another tone, just take soul.

1065
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:17,960
His favorite film is Brief and Counter. He has the tissue standing by.

1066
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:23,960
He thought, get short, he was just silly. He was mad about free Willy.

1067
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:31,960
And it's easy to see why. His wrists keep very fit and act too.

1068
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:38,960
They'll never need to join a gym. He has no need of friend or neighbor.

1069
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,960
He can toss without a cave.

1070
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,960
Oh, together, lucky him.

1071
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,960
There will be this full of different people.

1072
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:55,960
Some are moral, some are hinnuses.

1073
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,960
Some are ugly, some are like Venus. Some take photos of their penis.

1074
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,960
We all have our different acts.

1075
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,960
And as the world turns through a new day,

1076
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,960
we know that bankers will be banking.

1077
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,960
But this will be spiking.

1078
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:20,960
No doubt, bankers will be thinking you and people basic facts.

1079
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,960
Yeah, that's true.

1080
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:29,960
The Victoria Wood and Wankers wrap up episode number 778 of the Daily Source Code.

1081
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,960
Thank you very much for listening my friends.

1082
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:37,960
I'm off to the wonderful city of London, where, unfortunately, our liberties are diminishing every single day.

1083
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,960
But people are awakening. There's a big awakening taken place.

1084
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,960
People are figuring out that, hey, wait a minute.

1085
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,960
Just like George Carlin said, someone seems to own my ass and seems to be making me do stuff.

1086
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,960
I don't necessarily like doing.

1087
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,960
So please, my friends, live your life with passion.

1088
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,960
And while it lasts, enjoy your freedom.

1089
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,960
Another fine, medium presentation.

1090
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,960
Stick it in your ear.
