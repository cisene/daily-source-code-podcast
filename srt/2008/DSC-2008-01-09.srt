1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Make a statement with Sony stereo ear buds, sleek metal housings that reduce vibration

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,280
delivering killer sound from a tiny package, by yours at Sony.com-slashheadphones, Sony

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:22,120
ear buds with style meets sound.

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:34,880
You are listening to a man who tried to smuggle mouthwash onto a jetliner, Adam Curry.

5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:56,720
There's a reason for this, there's a reason for this, there's a reason education sucks,

6
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,960
is the same reason that will never, ever, ever be fixed, instead of going to get any better,

7
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,040
don't look for it, you're happy with what you got, because the owners of this country

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
don't want that.

9
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:16,960
I'm talking about the real owners now, the big, the wealthy, the real owners, the big wealthy business

10
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,760
and just the control things and make all the important decisions, they get the politicians,

11
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,400
they're there and you're relevant, the politicians are put there to give you the idea

12
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,400
that you have freedom of choice, you don't, you have no choice, you have owners, they

13
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,160
own you, they own everything, they own all the important land, they own and control

14
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,400
the corporations, they've launched this important pay for the Senate, the Congress, the

15
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,600
state thousands of city halls, they've got the judges in their back pockets, and they

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,520
own all the big media, all the big media companies, so they control just about all

17
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,240
of the news and information you get to hear, they got you by the balls, they spend

18
00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:00,360
billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying, to get what they want, well we know

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,480
what they want, they want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,320
you what they don't want, they don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking,

21
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,400
they don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking, that

22
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,600
I shouldn't let, that doesn't help them, that's against their interest, that's right,

23
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
you know something?

24
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,400
They don't want people who are smart enough to sit around to catch a table and figure out

25
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,800
how badly they're getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,640
ago, they don't want that, you know what they want, they want obedient workers, obedient

27
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,000
workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,840
just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower

29
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,360
pay the longer hours to reduce benefits the end of overtime and the vanishing patient that

30
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,880
disappears the minute you go to collect it and now they're coming for your social security

31
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,000
money, they watch your fucking retirement money, they want it back so they can give it to

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,840
their criminal friends on Wall Street and you know something, they'll get it, they'll get

33
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,440
it all from you sooner or later, because they own this fucking place, it's a big club and

34
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,240
you ain't in it, you and I are not in the big club, by the way it's the same big club they

35
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,920
used to beat you over the head with all day long and they tell you what to believe, all

36
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,800
day long beat you over the head of their media, it's only what to believe, what to

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,440
think and what to buy, the table is tilted folks, the game is rigged and nobody seems

38
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,160
to notice, nobody seems to care, good honest, hardworking people, white collar, blue collar doesn't

39
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,280
matter what color shirt you have on, good honest, hardworking people, continue, there's

40
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,200
a people of modest beans, continue to elect these rich cock suckers, they don't give a fuck

41
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,280
about them, they don't give a fuck about you, they don't give a fuck about you, they don't

42
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,280
care about you at all, at all, at all, at all.

43
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:56,840
And nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care, that's what the honors count on, the fact

44
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,720
that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant, because the honors of this country

45
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,960
know the truth, it's called the American dream, because you have to be asleep to believe.

46
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,560
And you're just as fucking me, I'll go for meals, big breast hit, treat it like

47
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,160
guests, I'm serving, take the breakfast, put it back, tonight three things to come, money

48
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,160
sex, sex, just like it, I'll get a full skirt, won't be pulled up, this is like

49
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,360
these are sex, these nuts, make the one she wrote, and it held them in the chalk, mix

50
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,000
sex, take, skit, make it go, all this money, make a bitch go, come, hook on the tip or make

Jane, I'm gonna put you my mom, Jane, I'm gonna put you my mom, Jane, I'm gonna put you my mom and Jane,

82
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,160
Jane, I'm gonna put you my mom, Jane, I'm gonna put you my mom, Jane, I'm gonna put you my mom, Jane, I'm gonna put you my mom, Jane,, I'm gonna put you my mom, Jane,

83
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Jane, I'm gonna put you my mom and Jane, I'm gonna put you my mom, Jane, I'm gonna put you my mom

84
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,520
You know what, I'm gonna scale up for the beautiful day today, my friends.

85
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,800
I mean, blue skies, completely blue skies.

86
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,400
Why am I not outside flying around the countryside, huh?

87
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,240
What's wrong with me?

88
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,020
Well, that's because I'm here for you.

89
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,140
Bring in you another sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-h-h-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

90
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,860
Yeah, what an opening, huh?

91
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,540
That's actually a YouTube video.

92
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,300
Of course, I'll put a link in the show notes.

93
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,820
All you got it by now, dailysourcedcoat.com.

94
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,060
Sent to me.

95
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,720
Who was it, Cannes on?

96
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,060
Let me just open up the Gmail Messenger.

97
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,140
Let's see if there was an actual name.

98
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,200
It was sent to a couple of people.

99
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,360
Cannes on Foster was also sent to, let's see...

100
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,640
How it's turned a show?

101
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:43,640
Yeah, yeah, sent to me in the stern show. Okay, interesting. I wonder if I would play it. Nice, nice images to go along with that.

102
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,640
And it does kind of make you think, you know, when you see what's going on with the primaries.

103
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Of course, the word now, by now, I think all the votes are in. It is early afternoon on Wednesday.

104
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:05,640
January the 9th, 2008, looks like Hillary Clinton took in the New Hampshire primary.

105
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Although it's kind of, we talked about this yesterday, and of course, no one called into actually explain how the caucuses and the primaries work.

106
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,640
So I'm not going to try to attempt that again.

107
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:25,640
But actually Obama and Clinton finished in a dead heat because they both have the same amount of committed delegates.

108
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:31,640
So again, it's not about the popular vote. It's about how many delegates you bring in. So really it was a tie.

109
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:41,640
Ron Paul looks like he came in fourth or fifth on the on the Republican side. No delegates from what I can tell from from the New Hampshire primary.

110
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,640
But at least he's above Giuliani. That's for sure. But really when you think about it, it's so true, man.

111
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,640
It's so true that we are bought and sold many, many times over.

112
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:59,640
Was another, I was a great link. Remember, I, I think I told you about the the sovereign wealth funds that are now being created.

113
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,640
You know, we still have this credit crunch.

114
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,640
And the banks are, you know, need to be bailed out.

115
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:15,640
And so who's helping him? But these, these wealth funds, these sovereign wealth funds, which means basically other sovereign nations are lending the banks money.

116
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:29,640
And this is great article by Donald Strassheim Forbes.com. Again, I'll put a link in the show notes to that as well. You've got to read this about China.

117
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:41,640
And they are accumulating about a billion dollars a day in foreign exchange reserves, essentially buying the United States, or at least the Wall Street part of the United States.

118
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
It's really quite unbelievable.

119
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:51,640
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, meanwhile we're just follow along with the news and pretending that it all makes a big difference.

120
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,640
All right, actually, did you see the Ron Pauls on Leno again? That was pretty interesting. After he was excluded from the Fox News debate.

121
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,640
And it might as well get into this right away.

122
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:17,640
Yesterday, the new republic came out with a scathing article, which was, it was really weird because they're quoting all these news letters from 25, 30 years ago that went out under Ron Paul's name.

123
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,640
It's just, you know, although they're quoting them, of course, there's no actual source material, no links.

124
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,640
But, you know, as usual, a million people sent me the link to this new republic article saying,

125
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Oh, Ron Paul's clearly in trouble. He's a racist. He's a bigger, he's an anti-Semite. And, you know, this is something that's been around for years and years.

126
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:53,640
Apparently, in Ron Paul's illustrious political career, actually, let me go to his website because he released a statement which I've just been copying everybody on.

127
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,640
I'm sure if you're following the, if you're following the the primaries.

128
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,640
Oh, crap.

129
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:11,640
Something was wrong with my router here at home. I'm not quite sure what's going on, but periodically just crap's out and it'll give me, you know, like can't make a connection.

130
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,640
Here we go. Ron Paul's statement on the new republic article.

131
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
I'll just read this to you verbatim.

132
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,640
In response to an article published by the new republic, Ron Paul issued the following statement,

133
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,640
the quotations in the new republic article are not mine and do not represent when I believe or have ever believed.

134
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,640
I've never uttered such words and denounced such small-minded thoughts.

135
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,640
In fact, this article was really unbelievable and think about the timing of it, huh?

136
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,640
Coming out on the eve of the new Hampshire primaries.

137
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,640
In fact, Ron Paul says, I've always agreed with Martin Luther King Jr.

138
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,640
that we should only be concerned with the content of a person's character, not the color of their skin.

139
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,640
As I stated on the floor of the U.S. House in April, 2019,

140
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:03,640
I rise in great respect for the courage and the high ideals of Rosa Parks, who stood steadfastly for the rights of individuals against unjust laws and oppressive governmental policy.

141
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,640
So that's the denunciation of this just fucked up article.

142
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:16,640
That again, included no direct links, no sources, no page numbers, no research whatsoever that you could actually delve into.

143
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,640
But the whole point is, and this is again, a quote from this news release, the story is old news,

144
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,640
that has been rehashed for over a decade.

145
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,640
It's once again being resurrected for obvious political reasons on the day of the New Hampshire primary.

146
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,640
And here's the important one.

147
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:39,640
When I was out of Congress and practicing medicine full-time, a newsletter was published under my name that I did not edit.

148
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Several writers contributed to the product.

149
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:48,640
For over a decade, I've publicly taken moral responsibility for not paying close attention to what went out under my name, indeed,

150
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,640
on these so-called newsletters, nowhere was Ron Paul's name, listed as a by-line.

151
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,640
But it's just amazing how this stuff propagates through the internet.

152
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:05,640
And maybe something I should pick up with John C. Devorek on this week's episode of Noah agenda,

153
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,640
where he thinks that the internet is only going to make news reporting worse,

154
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:17,640
and that the truth will have a much harder time bubbling up to the top because of all the disinformation.

155
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,640
I have to agree that it's starting to look like that because a lot of really smart people,

156
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,640
you know, just took this new Republic article as face value and said,

157
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,640
oh, well, clearly the guy's a bigot, he's a coo, he's a nut.

158
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,640
And it turns out that this has been something that's been going on for over a decade.

159
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,640
And that has already been rehashed even, it's even been discussed in the New York Times.

160
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:46,640
But still, you see how people catch on to this and take a lot of what's just written word as the absolute truth.

161
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Interesting.

162
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:55,640
Thanks a lot of you for sending in suggestions, comments, both about doing live shows,

163
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:02,640
which I got a pretty good list here of, let me just see if I can bring it up.

164
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,640
A list of different systems I could use.

165
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,640
A lot of them are video related, which is kind of interesting, but what I'm looking for really is,

166
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,640
you know, so we'll, what do you have, just in TV, you stream TV,

167
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,640
stick cam, mogulus, 10 mile per hour dot com.

168
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,640
What is that?

169
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:28,640
Some people even suggesting using Twitter to announce the fact that I'm going to do a live show.

170
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,640
What I'm really looking for, the streaming out portion is not that hard.

171
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,640
In fact, Casplaster Mike even offered to build a right into Casplaster.

172
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
That's the easy part.

173
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,640
What I'm looking for is, how do I bring people into the conversation?

174
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:47,640
It's got to be some kind of hand-raising system where I can see a chat room, see where someone

175
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,640
says, hey, I want to talk about this.

176
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,640
I need to be able to click a button and that person's audio needs to be coming in through

177
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,640
my mixer so I can put it right, put it him or her right onto the show.

178
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Doing that with video is not necessary.

179
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
I really want the audio portion.

180
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,640
So still on the lookout for something that'll work.

181
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,640
And of course, there were a couple of audio suggestions about what we should do to bring some new

182
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,640
creativity into the Charlie for 2008.

183
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,640
Adam, hey, this is Mark again in Los Angeles.

184
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,640
I just want to call you back on show 706.

185
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,640
You know, towards the end there, you're talking in the show a little bit.

186
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Maybe it sounds like getting away from some of the politics.

187
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
We're just cool.

188
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,640
I think that we can beat this thing a lot.

189
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,640
What is, you know, we're hoping that Ron Paul gets a little bit more ink.

190
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
It looks like he is.

191
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,640
And I think the DSC has done some good things.

192
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,640
But just to turn it a little bit, it back to the roots.

193
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,640
Dude, go back to what you do best.

194
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,640
You know, talk about the music, talk about the band, talk about shit.

195
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:56,640
What you're doing every day and go on on some of those adventures that you went.

196
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,640
You took your mic out there.

197
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,640
You just take a walk and just, we like to hear your, at least I do.

198
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:09,640
I like to hear just the rock and roll dude and just, and just keep it light and fun.

199
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,640
And get away from all the bullshit that's out there.

200
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,640
Because we need some fun, dude.

201
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,640
We need, we need the DSC and I do.

202
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
I want to fucking four or five right now.

203
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,640
Stop and go traffic and I got to listen some good tunes.

204
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,640
Kind of get a guy out there that's just, right, right, the wave a little bit.

205
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,640
And just what's happening around.

206
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,640
So anyways, that's what just I'll shut up now.

207
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,640
But all the best.

208
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,640
Right on.

209
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,640
Love you, it's just a good, but no homo.

210
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,640
Can't say it all the way.

211
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Yeah, I hear you, man.

212
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,640
You know, that is, of course, a great suggestion.

213
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
And really it's just that I've been home, I've been sick.

214
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,640
There's been, you know, all this crap that it's really is an interesting to talk about.

215
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,640
Literally crap when you consider how sick I was.

216
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,640
So that's why I've kind of been, you know, sucking air for material.

217
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:05,640
But there's going to be a lot of talk about the pod show network that I'll be doing in the next couple of weeks.

218
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,640
You know, we're working on changing the way that we do what we call talent relations.

219
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,640
I'm inserting myself very deeply into these new methodologies.

220
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,640
We've got, you know, some some great new ways of communicating as some new people who are who have joined the

221
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
talent relations group.

222
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,640
We have a lot of opportunities coming up, particularly with the launch of V3, V3 being the entire

223
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:38,640
new pod show dot com site, which I think we're just weeks away at this point from going into a closed

224
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
beta.

225
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,640
And there is so much work that has to be done and so much so much so many great things that

226
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,640
producers who are on the network and people who want to join the network and participate in

227
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,640
that I think I'm going to be talking a lot about that because it really is extremely exciting

228
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,640
shit that's coming down the bike.

229
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,640
So look for a lot of that.

230
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,640
And also I want to talk a more about the shows that you guys are doing out there.

231
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,640
What the hell are you doing?

232
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,640
You know, I've, I have to admit that I've been kind of in my own world.

233
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,640
It's been so incredibly busy for the past few months that I just, I just really haven't had,

234
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,640
haven't had the opportunity to delve back into what you guys are doing.

235
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,640
And so send me promos.

236
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Let me know what's happening on your show.

237
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,640
I want to talk about that.

238
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,640
They came from Japan.

239
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,640
Robots who are supposed to be entertaining.

240
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Robots who are supposed to be homeless.

241
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,640
So much for that.

242
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,640
From Mark Gilchumodonamkoff, award-winning author and creator of Shadow Force, and number one

243
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,640
with a bullet comes his most off-the-war audio book yet.

244
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,640
Robots run a mark in the city of Los Angeles.

245
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,640
Something manned he's bound to come.

Brand new music now from the potsafe music network.

251
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,640
I think this one's coming out this week.

252
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,640
It's from David Usher.

253
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,640
Neil Beer sent me this one.

254
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,640
Happy to play it because it kicks ass.

255
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
Chaka Dogley is beautiful.

256
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,640

I'm the chacha.

287
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:38,640
All the words we throw away, like they forgots, they just keep filing higher and higher, throughout the day, and large and cold, the script's real right.

288
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,640
In the cold, the way we love, the way we hate, it's quiet in your room.

289
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:52,640
All the words we throw away, like they forgots, they just keep filing higher and higher, throughout the day, and large and cold, the way we hate, it's quiet in your room.

290
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:00,640
All the words we throw away, like they forgots, they just keep filing higher and higher, throughout the day, and large and cold, the way we hate, it's quiet in your room.

291
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:18,640
All the words we throw away, like they forgots, they just keep filing higher and higher, throughout the day, and large and cold, the way we hate, it's quiet in your room.

292
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:45,640
All the words we throw away, like they forgots, they just keep filing higher and higher, throughout the day, and large and cold, the way we hate, it's quiet in your room.

293
00:21:45,640 --> 00:22:03,640
All the words we throw away, like they forgots, they just keep filing higher and higher, throughout the day, and large and cold, the way we hate, it's quiet in your room.

294
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:18,640
All the words we throw away, like they forgots, they just keep filing higher and higher, throughout the day, and large and cold, the way we hate, it's quiet in your room.

295
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:33,640
All the words we throw away, like they forgots, they just keep filing higher and higher, throughout the day, and large and cold, the way we hate, it's quiet in your room.

309
00:26:51,640 --> 00:27:14,640
was to get someone to underwrite for about $2 billion, the catalog, and they can't find anyone to do that, because there is no money available for it at the moment, so these guys are an incredible kimchi, which I think is swahili for shit, can't quite remember anymore, linked to that in the show, to DailySourceCode.com.

310
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:28,640
Hey Adam, this is Joel Welsh, I've been a listener since summer of 2005, and I'm finally motivated to call, because there are really two very unique things that I feel I have to share, I think you'd be interested in.

311
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:41,640
One is, I just finished listening to the DSC number 659 from September 4th, and I listened to it on January 7th, so that's the first unique thing, and I'll tell you a little bit more about that.

312
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:59,640
This was the show where you shared with us about your cat, Sidney, and the touched me very much, because we just recently went through a similar thing with our cat Moses, a very quick illness, 12-year-old cat, and yeah, man, it really hits your heart and...

313
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:07,640
I'll just correct you there, the cat's name was Cindy, and we miss him dearly, every single day. Was it really September 4th?

314
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:17,640
It seems like, in some ways, only yesterday, that he got taken away from us so abruptly, in other ways, it seems like Eons ago.

315
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,640
Yes, I remember, thank you.

316
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:25,640
Change your life, and we'll never get over it, certainly. We still have Joshua, and so that's wonderful.

317
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:35,640
But I was just reminded that, hey, it's been four months ago that you shared this very special thing in your life, and I'm learning about it now,

318
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:46,640
and it's because in August of 2007, this past August, I took a break from listening to the DSC, and I just picked back up in mid-December, but I stayed subscribed that whole time.

319
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,640
And when I wanted to start listening again, I decided I didn't want to miss anything.

320
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,640
I did such a part of your daily life for so long that I didn't want to miss a show, so I'm catching up.

321
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,640
Yeah, it never ceases to amaze me that people actually do that.

322
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,640
And I always say, please, take a break whenever you want to.

323
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:09,640
If you feel like you need to, you know, just step back from the earbuds for a while, that's completely okay.

324
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:15,640
But it never ceases to amaze me that people come back to the show, and then we'll pick up where they left off.

325
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:24,640
You know, sitting through tens of maybe hundreds of hours to catch up with the conversation, and I'm flattered.

326
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,640
No doubt, but I really don't understand it.

327
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
I really don't.

328
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,640
You don't have to. Don't feel like you have to do that, but it is obviously very much appreciated.

329
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:44,640
A little bit at a time, and I just thought you'd be really interested to hear that there are listeners like me that stay subscribed and catch up.

330
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,640
Even though it's, you know, it's been on four months behind.

331
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:54,640
The second thing is that I think is unique that it's worth sharing with you and your audiences.

332
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,640
I'm actually a startup company entrepreneur.

333
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:05,640
I've been the chief community officer at startupnation.com for the past four years, and now the CEO of a brand new startup company,

334
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,640
which will level the playing field for high school student athletes and kids in the performing arts,

335
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,640
so that they can showcase themselves for college scholarships and college showcase you.

336
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,640
We're going to have a public, public launch. They're spring with their website.

337
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,640
It showcases you that time.

338
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:31,640
But what you need about this aspect of me as a listener to the BSC is I listen to the BSC to gain insight into how you are growing and managing pod show.

339
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:37,640
I usually skip over the songs, although young pellets hit test rocks.

340
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,640
And I always listen to everything that Patricia has to say.

341
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
Yeah, me too.

342
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:49,640
But really, I believe that you and pod show are on the cutting edge of growing and internet based company, and that's what interests me the most.

343
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,640
So I certainly do have some catching up to do.

344
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,640
I can tell you exactly what your life was like in early September.

345
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,640
It would be fun to learn if you really have abandoned the idea of getting a replacement iPhone,

346
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,640
because I'm doing some researching on a new phone purchase myself right now.

347
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,640
So thanks Adam, love the DSC, and I hope your day is sensational.

348
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:18,640
Thank you, man. Well, you're in luck because, and I don't know how long it's going to take you to catch up to 707.

349
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,640
It seems like there's quite a number of hours to go through.

350
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,640
So feel free to skip ahead.

351
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,640
Yeah, as I said, I'm going to be talking a lot more about that as we've got V3 coming up.

352
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,640
We've got this thing.

353
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,640
We've got hundreds of producers who are just chomping at the bit to do more.

354
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,640
We've finally figured out a lot of our marketing initiatives.

355
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:46,640
So you should have a lot of fun listening and paying attention to what's going on.

356
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:53,640
And regarding the iPhone, yeah, you was, you know, I've actually, you don't, but other people know.

357
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,640
I reverted back to the Nokia E61I as my phone still loving that.

358
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,640
And of course, haven't talked about this in a couple weeks.

359
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,640
The Nokia N810 internet tablet is my new device of choice.

360
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,640
It fits beautifully between the phone and the laptop.

361
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,640
And this thing just kicks ass.

362
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:21,640
And of course, I was hoping that I was going to be able to offer it at a significant discount to the Chacha audience.

363
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
Before Christmas, didn't pan out.

364
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:29,640
There was all kinds of stuff that, you know, just didn't happen.

365
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,640
What can I tell you?

366
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,640
Part of it was agreements, part of it was some technical issues.

367
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:41,640
But it looks like by the 15th of this month, we'll finally be able to bring these to you at a great discount.

368
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Well, I'll be Hawking it because I love this device so much.

369
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,640
So just stay tuned to the Daily Source Code for more.

370
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,640
Jersey Todd has been raving about this guy.

371
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,640
His kids 15 years old and he's got a couple of songs on the pod save music network.

372
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
I got to tell you he's damn good.

373
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,640
Jason Moss, come back home.

374
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,640
I'm the journey.

375
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,640
All people change and I guess I did too.

376
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:15,640
It's not your fault that the flowers won't bloom.

377
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:25,640
I couldn't say that we're too bad it's years in our eyes.

378
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:42,640
In couldn't change that we're too bad it's grown.

379
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,640
Such a shame.

380
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,640
My predictions were wrong.

381
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:59,640
I couldn't say that we're too bad it's out in the sky.

382
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:17,640
And I want you to come back home.

383
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:25,640
Don't forget the faces you left alone.

384
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:51,640
In the dark you'll find the light.

385
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:57,640
It seems to me that I couldn't come.

386
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:04,640
A warning sign that we're going to fall.

387
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:13,640
So tell your friends that it looks like we're all going down.

388
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:32,640
Love once strong, it's now fading to cry.

389
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:39,640
Looks as though time has torn it away.

390
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:50,640
The piercing silence will open my eyes to the pain.

391
00:35:50,640 --> 00:36:06,640
I want you to come back home.

392
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:14,640
Don't forget the faces you left alone.

393
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:26,640
In the dark you'll find the light.

394
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:36,640
I want you to be okay though you've departed.

395
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:50,640
Your soul will stay in the dark you'll find the light.

396
00:36:50,640 --> 00:37:08,640
Baby soul you'll see that it was a man to be.

397
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:16,640
Baby you'll find the light.

398
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:26,640
My kids got some chops and there's nothing like a four and a half minutes song to enjoy my tuna for sandwich with.

399
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,640
Jason Moths come back home.

400
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:37,640
It's like a 12 minute special on the guy.

401
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:45,640
I've got a lot of administration to take care of to have tons of links in the show notes.

402
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:51,640
I've got all kinds of new messages from the savants who you are used to hearing from on the Charlie.

403
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Programmer sent me a note to that.

404
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,640
I heard you talk about Al Qaeda being a translation meaning the database in Arabic.

405
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,640
My mother's Lebanese and no Arabic so I ran my translation by her.

406
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,640
She said it means the file as in a Manila folder containing sheets.

407
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,640
Which I guess is kind of in a way like a database.

408
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,640
Well, this could be construed he says as a rudimentary database.

409
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,640
He said I actually had grand visions of Oracle hosted on CIA servers in Afghanistan.

410
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,640
I'm sure not the only ones who would you kind of make the clarification on your next show.

411
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,640
Absolutely.

412
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
And thank you.

413
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,640
Programmer for a.

414
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,640
I skews me.

415
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,640
Forgetting the the official translation.

416
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,640
Hey, here's a guy who promised he'd be back in 2008.

417
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,640
Comic strip.

418
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,640
Comic strip.

419
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,640
Comic strip.

420
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,640
Comic strip.

421
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,640
Comic strip.

422
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,640
Higher Adam Strawberry.

423
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,640
So we have a new year 2008.

424
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:04,640
And this year has been declared as EU year of intercultural dialogue.

425
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:13,640
Because in EU still some citizens think that they are better than others.

426
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,640
For example, why it's better than people of color.

427
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,640
West EU, better than East EU.

428
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,640
Catholic, Catholic, better than Muslims.

429
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:29,640
And it all must end because three EU citizens sit in the same boat.

430
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,640
Also think you winky should be able to carry his men back proudly in the whole EU.

431
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,640
OK.

432
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
Respect you.

433
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,640
You.

434
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,640
All right.

435
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,640
OK.

436
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,640
What we'll be looking forward to a lot more from new comic strip blogger.

437
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
Yes, of course.

438
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,640
We all have to get along at the EU.

439
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,640
Master sure.

440
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,640
Let me see if there's anything I've overlooked for today's show.

441
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,640
I had tons of notes here.

442
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,640
Let me say.

443
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,640
I think I'm pretty much pretty much on everything.

444
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Yes, it's actually pretty good article from Professor at the University of Chicago law school about the one laptop or child.

445
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,640
I will do that tomorrow.

446
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,640
I want to play one more song that has been sitting in my cube to play on the Charlie for about a month now.

447
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,640
Ingrid Michaelson, the way I am to wrap up today's Charlie.

448
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,640
I'm trying to show how see you if I know what I mean.

449
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
Just leave back a relapse.

450
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:36,640
If you were falling, then I would catch you.

451
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,640
You need a light.

452
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,640
I'd find a match.

453
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:51,640
Because I love the way you say good morning.

454
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:59,640
And you take me the where I am.

455
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:08,640
If you are chilly, here take my sweater.

456
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,640
Your head is aching.

457
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:23,640
I'll make it better because I love the way you call me baby.

458
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:36,640
And you take me the where I am.

459
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,640
I'd buy you again.

460
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:48,640
When you start losing all your hair, so I'm patches.

461
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:59,640
To all you tear, because I love you more than I could never promise.

462
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:07,640
And you take me the way I am.

463
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:20,640
You take me the way I am.

464
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,640
Short, sweet, and generally just really nice.

465
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,640
And of course, pod saving.

466
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,640
You should just take me the way I am.

467
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,640
And that'll do it for today's daily source code.

468
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,640
Pretty sure I'll be able to get another one done for you tomorrow.

469
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,640
So at least a three show week.

470
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,640
Look out.

471
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,640
That's another one of my resolutions for 2008.

472
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,640
I really want to get back to doing more shows.

473
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,640
Still looking for ideas on how to do live programming.

474
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,640
So looking really for some infrastructure.

475
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,640
Let me know what it will work for you.

476
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,640
And of course, everything discussed on today's program.

477
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,640
You will be able to find all the links to in the show notes at daily source code.com.

478
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,640
Send me an email.

479
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,640
Adam at podshow.com any old time.

480
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,640
And I'll talk to you tomorrow.

481
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,640
Bye bye.

482
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,640
Another podshow podcast.

483
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,640
Stick it in your ear.

484
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:17,640
Imagine headphones without wires.

485
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,640
Now their Sony's Bluetooth wireless headset.

486
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,640
A rechargeable listening experience with 11 hours of music playback.

487
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,640
So you and your music are free to move.

488
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,640
Take up yours at Sony.com slash headphones.

489
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,640
Sony wireless headphones.

490
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,640
Your music are unplugged.
