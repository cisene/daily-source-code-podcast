00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,600
No, I said that I can't fix it

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,440
I'd like to think I'm shring into the future

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,240

Fire in lies from the other side

Power into the darkness

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,280
Stand up and fight with your eyes

a no longer safe from those who would undermine our society.

51
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,280
And it's about time we said enough is enough.

52
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,280
It's all return to the traditional British values of discipline,

53
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,280
obedience, morality and freedom.

54
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,280

freedom's from the gypsies,

104
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:06,080
The affluent suburb of Surrey, known as Bielford, and still funky weather with those Atlantic

105
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,960
storms going on here, which of course with Hurricane Ike now nearing the Gulf Coast

106
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,600
of Texas, we're getting more of those Atlantic storms.

107
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,280
And of course my thoughts are going out to everyone on the Gulf Coast seems, of course,

108
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:26,640
this is rarely, rarely getting the attention that I forgot even the name of Moza, well,

109
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,720
I don't even remember the name of the hurricane that was going to hit Louisiana.

110
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,600
See how fast it goes?

111
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,200
It seems like it's just not getting the same amount of attention, you know, it's like

112
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,880
the news media say, oh, well, you know, it could probably slow down or I guess until

113
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,720
they get really the photos, you know, if it bleeds it leads, that's when it'll really spark

114
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
off.

115
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Anyway, it is Friday.

116
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,080
It's the Fubar Friday where fucked up beyond all repair or recognition as you prefer.

117
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,520
I want to say hi to everyone in the Netherlands listening, the former arrowheads, now

118
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,880
chuckleheads, who are joining our family, our community, which of course helps me aggregate

119
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,520
every single, each and every single show by throwing it into the drop drop.io slash daily

120
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,520
source code.

121
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,320
Man, you guys put together a doozy for me once again.

122
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,160
And by the way, I apologize, this is only the second show of the week, but man, it's just,

123
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,640
you know, I stopped doing this morning radio show in the Netherlands, and it really didn't

124
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,040
buy me that much extra production time because typically, I mean, it just, I get to sleep

125
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
a little bit longer.

126
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,600
I'd be getting up at 4am, do the show from 5 until 9am, and, you know, then chill out

127
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
for an hour or so.

128
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,000
And then I'd start working on the, you know, the regular day stuff, and of course, the

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,720
biggest problem was in the evening hours when San Francisco was up and up and about.

130
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,360
That starts around 430 p.m. London time, which is 830 a.m. San Francisco.

131
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,280
You know, and that could go to 910, 1030 11, and of course, that's really where I was

132
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,200
cutting into the lifestyle because I was just wasn't getting enough sleep, but it's not

133
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,200
like I actually have, you know, all that much more time on my hands during the waking

134
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,520
hours, and actually been spending a lot of time with me via, we got a lot of new stuff

135
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,480
that were actually Monday, we're coming out, I think, with a new version of the site,

136
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:15,720
Monday, maybe Monday, evening, Pacific Standard Time, so it's been busy, it really has

137
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,400
end the lady Patricia is off on one of her johns, she's a judge on another fabulous show.

138
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,600
This one's called pop stars. So you made maybe, I don't know if the show was in America,

139
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,000
it was a big hit in the UK, many countries in the world where it's done quite quite well.

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,400
And this is all about singing, so it's a little bit, you know, it's actually 100% up

141
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,040
or alley, and she's enjoying it. And that's the most important thing. But of course,

142
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,720
she's gone for a week, so I'm taking care of the, the Moranic teenager.

143
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,160
Every single night, I'm going to go out now. Are we going to go, I'm going to go to the pub.

144
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,720
She doesn't really drink, you know, she'll have like half a, a Cardi Briser, maybe.

145
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,840
But, uh, uh, she says, yeah, because I'm legal now, I can do whatever I want. I'm legal.

146
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:09,160
Oh, kids, I tell you, but she's been good. She's been there. She's really been helping

147
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,280
out this time around, uh, with some of the chores around the house. Man, the house is just too big.

148
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,200
And the lady piece looking for a place in London, which I'm looking forward to, because hopefully

149
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,040
it'll be something a little bit smaller. We really don't need all that much room now that, uh,

150
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,240
the teenagers legal and, you know, just kind of basically hangs out to eat my food,

151
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,720
I sleep in, uh, in my house, and invite all our friends over to do the same. Anyway,

152
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,320
it's been, uh, it's really been a fantastic week. Um, and I've been, uh, doing a lot of research, uh,

153
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,080
in the evening hours, you know, watching a lot of Fox News, CNN, Russia today, uh,

154
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:53,000
CNBC, CNBC is, it's just fantastic. And of course, uh, the show, the closing bell with Maria

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,640
Bartiromo comes on around, I think you're not six or seven, 30. Maybe even 8 or 8, 30. Anyway,

156
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,680
it's in the evening hours. I always seem to catch it. And you can just see the dismay on everybody's face.

157
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,120
And they have nothing to say. They absolutely, you know, no one has any insights, no one knows

158
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,080
what to do, what to say, because they're all seeing it crumbling before they're very eyes. Obviously,

159
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,600
this all started with the, well, it started a long time ago, but, uh, the effective nationalization

160
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,880
of a phanny may and Freddie Mac, which I did want to mention, by the way, uh, for the UK folks,

161
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,240
you must be snickering every single time you hear that on the news, phanny may. You know, when I grew,

162
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,520
uh, a phanny was your backside was your butt. And my mom was, I'm, I'm going to spank your phanny.

163
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,520
In the UK, however, I learned, uh, well, only a couple of years ago, we moved here that phanny,

164
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:52,920
is actually, uh, it's a slang word for vagina. Uh, probably, it's probably more

165
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,040
equatable to pussy. Because I have heard them say it on television, you know, oh, well,

166
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:05,240
something happened with my phanny. I just, this is so weird. Uh, really, uh,

167
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,560
common, uh, two two countries they're separated by a common language, huh? Anyway, so, um,

168
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,840
you probably heard about Lehman Brothers. Now, this is one of the true old, uh, I'd almost call them

169
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:27,240
a Luminati firm, um, who, uh, had this huge, real estate portfolio, huge portfolio of mortgage

170
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,400
back to assets. There you go. Uh, and, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, when you really follow

171
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,760
the money, it's so easy to see why all of this is falling apart. Because basically no one's lending,

172
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:45,240
no one has any. And now shareholders, they are kind of tapped out as well. Even the sovereign wealth funds,

173
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,040
you know, the only way they can put more money into the kitty is by printing it. That's just,

174
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,480
uh, in China. And Lehman Brothers dropped significantly. They're kind of in that same spiral that

175
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,800
Bear Stearns was in. Once, you know, once the rumor gets out and once people start talking, I mean,

176
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,400
that's basically the end of it. And, uh, we'll see maybe to, maybe even today after the, this show

177
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,000
goes up or maybe next week, I think Lehman, uh, they'll be bought for, uh, for a couple of pennies.

178
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,640
Now, Merrill Lynch, another one of the big, the big boys, their shares fell 17% on Thursday.

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,080
Same, uh, same type of thing that, uh, that Lehman Brothers is going through. These, these are big

180
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:32,120
firms. These are the, the, the, the, the, the monoliths. In fact, they're not the only monolith. And again,

181
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,880
I'm, uh, I'm just taking mainstream news reports. This is from Reuters. Uh, this next one is, uh,

182
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,960
from Motley Fool. All the links in the show notes. I mean, I'm not making it up. This is not,

183
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,720
wacky conspiracy stuff. It's just news that is reported on by some really good reporters,

184
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,160
but the trick is is to aggregate all these stories together so you can connect the dots because

185
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,160
mainstream media, particularly the news media is not going to put this up there for you. Then

186
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,880
not going to lay it all out because it's, it's not in the interest of the corporations. Of course,

187
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,760
only a few corporations really own the media. As we all know, it's, it's, and I'm not just saying

188
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,720
it, it's the truth. Go look it up. Do some research. So this independent media is extremely

189
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:19,080
important. Next one to go, uh, could possibly be Washington, Mutual. Uh, this is, uh, this is,

190
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,080
this is pretty scary because this is, in fact, I'm reading an article here from Motley Fool.

191
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,720
Uh, an ill-timed venture into subprime has left Washington, uh, Mutual's books looking like

192
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,880
they just got hit by a nuclear bomb. How's that for an analogy? Last quarter,

193
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,240
net charge offs came in and more than three and a half percent escorted by a $3.3 billion loss

194
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,480
and a supernova. I'd love this. It's not the full guys. A supernova of loan loss provisions

195
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:56,680
to nearly $6 billion. At the end of last quarter, Washington, Mutual, uh, held more than 60,

196
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:03,560
$6 billion in home equity loans and lines of credit. And if you think that, uh, this takeover,

197
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:09,560
this, uh, nationalization, this, uh, basically socialist, if not communist move, completely

198
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:15,240
on American, if you think that's going to save anything or anybody, um, briefly, only so that

199
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,400
everyone could bail out. And we're going to talk about that a little bit, uh, a little bit later

200
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:25,080
because, uh, well, I, I think there's, uh, I think there's, uh, I think there's a few things that, um,

201
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,120
that need to be, uh, linked together. One more story here from blue bloomberg.com.

202
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:38,600
Uh, this is the true cost of this, uh, phanny may Freddie Mac or, I like to call them fraughty and phony.

203
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,720
What the true cost will be. And this is because the oversight, uh, is the oversight board, which is an

204
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,040
independent, uh, uh, the organization. It's not a part of the government. They're basically,

205
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,560
say, hey, you know, um, you guys, you, when you take over these companies, you actually have to put

206
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,800
that, you know, the debt of those two companies onto the books of the United States. So the United

207
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:09,080
States now has, I believe, nine or $10 trillion in debt, which we owe to foreign, uh, countries mainly,

208
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:17,320
and some big ones like China. And, uh, that just might be opt significantly by, uh,

209
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:24,040
well, at least 50% because the oversight board says, you know what, um, that's 5.2 trillion in debt

210
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,680
on phanny may and Freddie Mac's books. They need to be on the United States's books as well. And, uh,

211
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,040
for, you know, there's, there's not a lot of news about this. I'm trying to find it here and

212
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,040
their Bloomberg is the one that's really, uh, following the story and reporting on link in the

213
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,600
show notes, of course, a daily source code.com. But their, a Bloomberg is saying, you know, this

214
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,840
actually could be true. It may have to go on to the, onto the books, which means we now have

215
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:52,360
14 or 15 trillion dollars worth of debt. Um, and, uh, and, and these, and it's, it's, it's interesting to

216
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:59,240
watch, uh, they have, um, you know, if you buy government or treasury bonds, and now phanny may

217
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,720
in Freddie Mac are essentially exactly the same. They're priced the same. They're, they're valued

218
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:10,120
the same way. Uh, but there's a spread, which you have to pay to ensure we don't have to ensure,

219
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,560
but which most, uh, good investors do, and certainly the banks, is they want to ensure that, you know,

220
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,200
so they have this debt. So let's say $10 million worth of debt from phanny may Freddie Mac,

221
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:30,280
and you can sure against it. And at one point, it was, I believe around $70,000 to ensure $10 million

222
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:37,880
of debt. Now that has popped up to, uh, essentially $700,000 to ensure $10 million worth of debt,

223
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:43,000
because the, uh, United States is not seen as credit worthy anymore. We don't have the goal to back

224
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,320
it up. And we could certainly do fine on our own, but this system has to end. You know, we need

225
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,720
a massive reboot. And the big question is, who's going to control the reboot? Because it's

226
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,440
going to happen. You know, when you have your computer and whether it's Windows, even a Mac, you know,

227
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,280
sometimes you can say, oh, shit, man, I know it's going to happen. It's going to freeze. And then it

228
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,720
does. And then there's only one of two things that can happen either. You're going to do a control

229
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,160
all delete or you're going to hold down the power button on the Mac, which is the way it works on

230
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,840
the Mac. You know, we lead one finger, one finger operation to make my Mac come back to life.

231
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,840
Or you'll know sometimes what it's just like, explodes almost and it reboots by itself. So what's

232
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,840
going to happen? And who's going to be in charge of it? Because we have a presidential election coming

233
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:34,680
up very, very soon. Or as many have often said, do you think that George W Bush and the Bush administration

234
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,760
might actually use this to postpone the elections under Marshall Law? There's a lot of talk about it.

235
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:46,040
I have no proof that it's going to happen that way. But oh, man, it's an interesting thought.

236
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,800
So again, these, this bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, you know, as far as I'm concerned,

237
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:00,280
it really was, well, obviously it had to be done because the whole system was going to come down

238
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,080
worldwide. And there's just too much pressure. Although I think that probably would have been a

239
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,320
reasonable alternative because we just got to go through it. We're going to have to go through the

240
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,200
pain. There's no two ways about it. But people are trying to save themselves and better yet

241
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,760
they're trying to save their own hides or their interest or corporate interest. And there's one

242
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:25,240
guy who I often bring into the show, not really by invitation, but I do pay to get his video.

243
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,160
So I don't feel too bad about playing the audio from one. It's the kid from Brooklyn who has a

244
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,640
very unique take on exactly what's going on in the United States of America and the world

245
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:42,040
when it comes to finances. Hey, the big man's back. WWE that the kid from Brooklyn that

246
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:51,240
got. I keep telling you the world's coming to an end. I mean, come on, give me a break, George Bush.

247
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:58,520
He bailed out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but truly isn't out. Is that me? Come on,

248
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:05,880
would he bail out George Bush's shop if Joe went broke and bankrupt and had three kids in a

249
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:12,200
wife and couldn't pay the mortgage on his house? No, we wouldn't. But he bailed out all these

250
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:21,080
billion dollar companies. Not only that, the head CEO's that he's companies are getting compensation pay

251
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:28,120
over 40 million dollars a piece. Let me come on. The world's coming to an end. Why don't the

252
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:35,320
people in this country say something? Nobody says nothing. The rules really. I mean, I'd be out there

253
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:44,040
writing it in a streets now. Don't show people understand. The United States of America is broke

254
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:52,600
with Brooklyn busted. We all want three dollars. We can borrow no more. You know the dollars

255
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:00,680
work today in a farm and country. Don't eat sense. The American currency ain't worth nothing

256
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:10,520
no more. But nobody. Nobody says anything. I'd be out there now and Washington DC. The true

257
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:18,760
home of all guys crying. Ryan would mean some people had to come on. What's going on here in the

258
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:26,280
world. The government won't work for the people. The government works for all these special

259
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:33,160
interests and corporations. They don't work for me and you, the people. They work for these

260
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:41,160
rent passes. They run people for three years of dollars. I'm tired of this fucking shit. I want

261
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:47,880
to eat people say something. I want the whole world on a revolution here. We can't let this

262
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:57,720
go on. This is the device. What do you raise space? What do you weigh? Think about it. This is

263
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:08,920
the big man. The voice. The voice of people that's right. Twenty cents on a fucking dollar

264
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:16,920
and a big man's always happy to see. I love anger. What a beautiful emotion. The kid from

265
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,000
Brooklyn tells it and tells it straight. But yeah, that's right. We're not out there writing.

266
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,360
We're not outrage because it's not being told. We don't know the story. If you know someone who's not

267
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:34,600
awake yet, hand them a copy of this show. Turn them on to one of the many other shows that talk

268
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,440
about what's really going on in the world. The true reality, the real truth. And I know it's weird

269
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,360
to understand and weird to even comprehend because you think to yourself, no one could really be

270
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:53,080
that evil. Unfortunately, it's just the way it is. Now, it doesn't matter. I'm not here to

271
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,400
bum you out to bring you into put you into bad mood, particularly for the weekend because this is

272
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,120
all good. It's all good. The direction we're headed because we're waking up. We're understanding

273
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,960
what's happening. We're talking about it amongst ourselves with our friends, our family,

274
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,440
our colleagues, it's school. I hear Christina talk about it with her friends all the time. That's

275
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,440
specifically to this detail that we're talking about here on the show. But she's not oblivious

276
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,600
and she doesn't watch television. And that's really, really important. And we have to protect our

277
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,600
internet's at all cost because that's what they're coming for. I don't think they actually can come

278
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,560
for it. But you watch when I've all kinds of tracking installed. It's going to start in the United

279
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:37,080
Kingdom first. In fact, it has already started. You know about all the cameras. You know about

280
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:45,000
the random searches on the street in the subways, the tubes. And I saw someone get in search

281
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,440
randomly at Waterloo Station just yesterday. And it was interesting because after my trip into town

282
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,280
had a couple meetings, I was walking up the back steps to Waterloo Station. Actually, it's the

283
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,400
front steps, but it's not where the taxi cabs are. So you come in like a track 16 or whatever.

284
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,600
And there was, I don't know if there was two guys fighting on the street. And they weren't fighting

285
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,360
there. We're yelling at each other. And just as I was crossing the street, so I'm aware of what's

286
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,960
going on. Like, okay, I'm just going to keep walking and see what's going and see if anyone needs

287
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,520
some help. So I did turn around and stood for a second and looked like these guys. I don't know if

288
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,720
they're going to go out at or not, but they were yelling shouting then within seconds. Like a police

289
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:28,040
bus, a patty wagon. Like screeches to a halt. Three cops jump out. They jump on these guys and they're

290
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:37,800
kicking them. Like I see them being this guy in the back. And for what? You know, so they were

291
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,720
yelling at each other. You could have just calm down the situation. It was a real face-to-face

292
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:50,360
reality check for me for a moment there. Anyway, it's as I'm saying, it's this is good because

293
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,520
we're waking up and once enough people are awake, then we can actually start changing things. And we

294
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:01,000
will, but still a lot of crap to go through first. And you know what? Just by exposing you to the

295
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,800
real truth and to the information that's out there being reported by mainstream media. This is

296
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:13,960
not just stuff out there that's on the internet. Yeah, these are by real reporters doing real reporting

297
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,880
work. Just back to the Fannie Mae Freddie Mac bailout for a second. So I'm pretty sure on Tuesday

298
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:26,280
we talked about this that the London Stock Exchange suffered a computer bug, which they still

299
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,800
have not actually told anyone about, identified what exactly the problem was. You know, something

300
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:38,360
that couldn't have been for seeing, but now that we fix it, it'll never happen again. So I've seen

301
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:44,200
some blogs out there saying, well, you know, this thing was running on Microsoft.net, that's why,

302
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,640
you know, it should have been on Linux servers, then it wouldn't have been okay. Let me tell you,

303
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:55,560
I've been around a lot of trading systems. And yeah, a lot of it's built on on some off the shelf

304
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:04,840
quote, off the shelf stuff like Microsoft SQL Server, but also Oracle. And these guys are not stupid.

305
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:12,040
Okay, shit like this does not go down for seven hours. Unless there's as far as I'm concerned,

306
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:22,600
unless there's sabotage involved. So I wanted to add one extra thing to this story,

307
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:30,280
because I found this only after I'd done Tuesday show that the, and I saw it in a very small

308
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,840
mention about some, you know, because of course, everyone over in the UK was like freaking out,

309
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,320
because this was their opportunity to make a lot of money. Some people made a billion dollars on

310
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,880
Monday because they knew all the financial stocks would be a huge bump. Everyone's getting out

311
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,920
personally. That's exactly what that was all about. And I believe that they sabotage the London

312
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:56,840
Stock Exchange, except there was one trading system under new regulation, go figure out. New regulation

313
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:03,720
has allowed private trading systems or black hole pools as they're also known. As long as there's no

314
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:10,120
more than 500 people connected to the trading system. So I read this, I was reading this article

315
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,880
about the London Stock Exchange, and that, you know, I was really pissed off that couldn't trade,

316
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:24,600
except some trades are being executed on turquoise. And turquoise is a trading system, which was

317
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:32,840
just set up by here comes, Maryland, Lehman, all the big boys. It's their own private trading

318
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:39,400
system. And that was working just fine. Thank you very much. Not only that, it was the first official

319
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:47,720
launch day, the first official launch day. And then I found another story. So that was the ninth

320
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:54,280
on September's second. That was one week before. I'll just read from this. This is from financialnews.com.

321
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,600
Turquoise, the European equity trading system set for launch next week suffered. It's first

322
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,840
technical glitch. Well, testing yesterday as a firewall crash, leaving some brokers,

323
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:09,080
unable to trade for a few minutes. So they had a little problem. They fixed it. And they probably

324
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,800
took that little problem and spewed it onto the London Stock Exchange, because believe me, these guys

325
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:21,960
made a killing. They were the only ones able to trade. Links in the show now to DaddySourceco.com.

326
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,560
I know you're going to appreciate reading this whole story because it just shows you more of what's

327
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,160
really going on now. You know, these guys, they can't, they're fighting each other. This is how

328
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:36,840
bad it's gotten. Like they're stealing from each other. Everyone's trying to bail out themselves.

329
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,880
First above anything else. And I found an awesome song on the drop, which comes from the mad

330
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,880
money machine, which I want to play for you right now. It's so in line with all this. It's called

331
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,720
The Dead Prison Blues. It's here on Daily Sourceco 788.

332
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:33,560
Well, it's just a baby. I'm on this city. Always be a good boy. Don't play with activities,

333
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:39,720
but I bought some shares of fannings. Just to watch them slide.

334
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:49,720
When night flows and bells starts ringing, I might head in a grime.

335
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:29,400
I've met the politicians and the bankers and the fair. Got out of the market before

336
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:37,080
everything went red. Well, I know I had a comment. I know I can't be free.

337
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:46,840
Cause those people took my money. And that's what torture is mean.

338
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,040
Well, if they freed him from this prison, if that portfolio was mine,

339
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:03,160
I bet I'd buy some index funds and everything would be fine. And bought from Daily's prison

340
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:17,160
as well. I won't do it. And I'd let that closing bell bring my blues away.

341
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:24,760
The Dead Prison Blues has sourced from the mad money machine. Check it out mad money machine.com

342
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,160
and hopefully that song will be released somewhere because it should get out, man. It's cool.

343
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,320
You'll notice I'm not going to talk about Kanye West assaulting a photographer.

344
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,280
I can't believe what passes for news these days. It's just unbelievable. It really is.

345
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:52,760
And watching Fox News and CNN too, CNN is clearly now the Obama news station. Fox

346
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:58,680
obviously the McCain palean station. Both of those both the Democrats and the Republicans,

347
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:06,680
it's just a show. Okay. See it as a show because they are not actually going to run or control anything.

348
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,520
And speaking of running and controlling ever since Lindsey Williams came out,

349
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:19,080
or since I was exposed to his story, Lindsey Williams probably recall is the pastor who worked for

350
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:27,400
oil companies up in Alaska in the 70s. And he became an insider literally and has come out

351
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:33,560
multiple times about how it works and how they control the oil. And he said, look, oil's going down

352
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:38,520
to $60 a barrel. No matter what happens. And you can even see it now. So here comes Hurricane Ike.

353
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:44,040
What happens oil goes down? Oh, because we're using less. Is sure we're using somewhat less. But this

354
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:50,200
is horseshit. You don't go from a 147 to below 100 with a hurricane headed right towards the

355
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,720
Gulf. You just don't. The whole reason the oil is being pressed down is because they want to

356
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:03,160
bankrupt the Arabs. They want to bankrupt them and then start drilling and be the sole supplier.

357
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:08,120
We've got plenty of oil in the United States. That's clearly the plan. You know, calling for drilling

358
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,840
and now, and this is from, where did I get this from? This from MSN money? I'm sure that they just

359
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:21,640
bought this probably. Maybe not. Douglas Mac and Tire. And this is yesterday, so September 11th,

360
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:28,120
you probably recall that so, you know, the OPEC, the oil-producing economic community countries,

361
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:35,160
sorry, who desperately wanted to push back on, you know, them being bankrupted essentially,

362
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,960
they see the oil. They see what's happening. They see it being brought down.

363
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,560
And then the OPEC said, well, you know, we're just going to lower production a little bit,

364
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,480
which is the game they always play. So that's there into the equation, because if they lower production

365
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:56,120
less supply, supply and demand, you know, less supply, same demand, price will go up.

366
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:03,080
And how Saudi Arabia walked away? Walked out of OPEC yesterday. This is big.

367
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,480
This is really, really big. And they say that they were tired of the rants from Hugo Chavez

368
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:17,480
of Venezuela, as well as the oil minister from Iran. So again, it's all about the three major

369
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:23,080
currencies, gold, which you can't get anymore. You could get you could buy paper that says you

370
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:28,920
you will own some gold, but it's actually, it takes two months now to get just some gold,

371
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:37,160
physical gold drugs. And I'm not talking about marijuana. I'm talking about cocaine heroin

372
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:44,520
mainly, because that's the stuff that's coming out of Afghanistan. You know, the poppy fields

373
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:51,400
were down to zero. And the Taliban forced everyone to grow new crops. You know, the kind you could

374
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:57,080
eat. And then we show up with a coalition. And now they're back in their producing again. I'm sure

375
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,560
please Google CIA Jets smuggle cocaine. Because that is a huge currency. One of these days

376
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:09,720
I'll really get into it. I'm not quite affluent enough in it to really let it all flow out as,

377
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,400
you know, here's how the story sits, but I'm getting pretty close. But the US government certainly

378
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:21,480
is involved in drug smuggling. It's proven if you read Legacy of Ashes, the history of the CIA,

379
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:28,840
which my uncle Don, who lived most of that story and was a Bush senior's personal advisor.

380
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,640
He was there during a ran concert. That's what it was all about. He says it's true. It's exactly

381
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:39,480
the way it happened. And it hasn't stopped. Drugs for weapons, drugs for money. That's how money

382
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:47,000
comes into Wall Street. And so now they're all fighting amongst the third real true currency, which is oil.

383
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,640
And then I'm sure, hopefully you heard about this. But again, being buried under the

384
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:00,600
under our VP, Elf, our VILF, Sarah Paylon. And by the way, I still think she's kind of hard. There's

385
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:08,200
nothing wrong with that. But I hope that you heard about the investigation and interior department

386
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:16,200
investigation of the mineral management agency, I think it is. These are the people who actually

387
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:22,840
determine inside the government what licenses are given out for drilling, mainly offshore drilling.

388
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:33,080
And the oil companies, clearly they go and try and get better contracts. And they're always trying

389
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,600
to get what they want. And the way they've been getting it is, of course, a fine American tradition.

390
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,720
By bribery, not just bribery with money. It's the mineral management service, actually.

391
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:55,720
This is the one in Denver. They were hanging out, doing drugs, having sex, going on ski trips,

392
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:04,600
golf outings, with energy company representatives in our very own government.

393
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:10,760
So this is a pretty big investigation. And I really wish this is on the front page every single

394
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:17,400
day here. I'm quoting from Yahoo. So these are probably an AP story. Yeah, associated press.

395
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:27,480
It's funny where was it? Yeah, employees frequently consumed alcohol and industry functions.

396
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:33,080
Had used cocaine in marijuana and had sexual relations with oil and natural gas company representatives.

397
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:38,120
Who are these people? I want names. I want pictures. And we put on the news where,

398
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:47,640
you set up horny guys with an IQ of 65 saying, hey, I'm a hot teenager. I want to come over and

399
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:54,280
have some sex. And then you got the news crews sitting there waiting to hijack the guy.

400
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,760
Why don't we do it with these freaking people? By the way, that is a show. I think that we get

401
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:08,360
huge ratings. I'm more than willing to finance that program with what a great idea.

402
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,040
Excellent. If you want to do the work, if you want to do the research, if you want to go find

403
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,280
these people, if you want to go hijack them and you know, blue or they're men. But hey,

404
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,600
it's another one of those parties. We got some sex. We got some coke. We'll talk some oil.

405
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,000
We'll give you some deals, some contracts. And then real men. I'm paying. I'm paying for the

406
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:36,120
production of that program. You better believe it. Okay. Well, is this going to be a long show

407
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,120
by the way? And this is another part of the problem. I'm having the track that I've gone down

408
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:45,160
and all the information that's coming out. It seems like it's expanding exponentially. And so

409
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,400
I couldn't even do less than an hour a day no matter what topic I just keep on talking.

410
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,200
And then I'm only a third of the way through today's list. And what are we at right now?

411
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,000
Let me just check. We're probably already 40 minutes. Aren't we? 36, 37. Yeah.

412
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,760
Bob Woodward. This is one of the journalists who uncovered the entire watergate scandal. He has

413
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:12,200
a new book out. And it's unfortunate because all this good stuff always comes out in books.

414
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,240
And that just doesn't matter to the American people because essentially the only people who

415
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:23,160
read are elitist. It's a very small percentage. I think of people who aren't reading tabloid

416
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:31,160
or watching TMZ videos or looking at Madison Avenue's representation of how women should really

417
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:37,000
look like. You're all sun goddesses. It's not about what make up you have or what bag.

418
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,920
If you're fat or you're thin or you're tall or you're short or you're skinny, you're all beautiful.

419
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:51,880
Bullshit. So Bob Woodward, who's kind of pretty himself, too? He has a new book out. And it's

420
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:59,640
quite astounding. And the main thing that I find so astounding is one part in the book.

421
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,120
And he was on fresh air, which is an MPR program, but Terry Gross, excellent show.

422
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,800
And I'm going to play this bit for you because I really want you to hear it coming out of

423
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:17,560
his mouth. Okay? Because we've talked about laser weapons, how tasers are just a precursor to

424
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,920
what's coming. So we can get used to it. I think they call them energy-directed weapons.

425
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,600
And it all sounds really futuristic and kind of wacky. But I want you to listen to what Bob Woodward

426
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,360
writes about in his book. Here he is a couple minutes, but well worth it. A couple of minutes

427
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:39,960
of him talking about it on fresh air with Terry Gross. Expectation, then all of this hyperbolic

428
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,560
rhetoric that we've heard for so many years. You're right that the surge is one of four things

429
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,360
that has contributed to the progress that's been made in Iraq. What are the other three?

430
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:57,320
First the Ambarawakenim where the Sunis came over, or this was before the surge, it started.

431
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,040
I'm sorry about the quality. I'm not quite, I transferred this, I don't know why it sucks

432
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,360
something went wrong there. But it's listenable. So he's going to explain these four things.

433
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:13,560
Really important you listen to the fourth. We're disgusted with Elkida in the extreme efforts by

434
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:24,280
Elkida to impose very strict law in Elkida made a strategic mistake. And so the Sunis said,

435
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,480
this is too extreme. We're going to sign up with the U.S. and this really sucks ass.

436
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:35,160
Why does it sound so shitty? Damn. Well, let me fast-forward to the fourth bit thing,

437
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,600
because I can you can't listen to this whole thing. A series of operations that have been developed

438
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:49,800
that allowed the U.S. forces to locate target and kill extremists, Elkida members and members

439
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:56,600
of the insurgency. On Friday, the White House, in responding to the book for the first time,

440
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:05,160
publicly confirmed that there were, quote, newly developed techniques and operations which helped

441
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:13,000
the situation stabilise and rock. If the request of the military and the White House,

442
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,640
you're not revealing any of the details you found out about what these top secret operations

443
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:24,680
are, what can you tell us? Okay. So in case it's hard for you to hear, he's saying at the U.S.

444
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:30,840
the White House saying they have all these secret operations and weapons that makes them invincible

445
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:41,080
super weapons. So we can track anyone, anyone, and kill them. That it's like any war. There is always

446
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:48,280
something. There's a game changer, a new development and you know, early early 20th century. It was

447
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:56,440
the tank of the airplane World War II, Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic bomb.

448
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:03,560
These operations and techniques are not something where you're going to see an explosion like

449
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:12,440
an atomic bomb, but they're incredibly effective. There's something that is present. Bush said to

450
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:19,400
people that are quote in the book, we are killing them all. We are killing all of the people who

451
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:25,080
were the leaders. Now it's not literally all that they are killing hundreds and hundreds of key

452
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:33,160
people on the other side in this conflict. So there you have it. We are killing them all,

453
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:39,640
says my president, if you can believe it, I'm so ashamed. And we're killing them with secret weapons

454
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:49,960
as big as the Manhattan Project, it's something totally new. I think it's pretty well documented that

455
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,400
there are microwave type weapons. I think about it. You have an energy weapon in your home.

456
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:02,760
It's called a microwave. You know, it's just a box that emits radiation. Radio signals, in fact,

457
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:11,720
a form of radio signals. And it can fry shit. And so imagine if they can pinpoint a beam of

458
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,760
microwave energy, they can fry anybody. And I've seen these pictures. They're around there. Go

459
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,560
Google it. Look for energy directed weapon and look for pictures. Do it in image search.

460
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,040
Make sure your safe search is off. Because that stuff will certainly get filtered out.

461
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:30,840
Yeah, they, it's almost like taking a hot dog. Put a hot dog in the microwave for for

462
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:37,320
50 to 30 minutes. It'll shrink down to the size of like a, a little breakfast sausagey thingy.

463
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:43,560
That's what happens to humans when they're fried with the microwave. That's what we got.

464
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,840
And we got a lot more. I'm sure of it a lot more that's not being talked about.

465
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,200
It's fucking crazy, man.

466
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,760
Hi, Adam. It's Matt from Games. We're on this week's show. We have a look at

467
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,560
Monster madness on the PlayStation 3. Facebook on the Xbox 360. You can also

468
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:10,520
in copies of Final Fantasy 4 for the Nintendo DS. And we've got some very exciting news on

469
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,240
February 9. That's all against Weasel.com.

470
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,200
Thanks for reminding you that GoDaddy has the best deals anywhere for domain names.

471
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:23,800
You can get one for $6.95 for an entire year by using one of my code. I actually want to use

472
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:31,320
DSC 3 for that. And I want you to be listening to all kinds of shows out there in the UK.

473
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:39,080
As we're now kicking off with the.co.uk domains cheaper than any other place to get a.co.uk

474
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:48,600
domain. And I mean by substantial amounts. This is, I've seen this. Well, I actually haven't seen

475
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:56,360
the video. I've heard the audio. I've heard extrapolations of Matt Damon, who was condemning

476
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:03,160
Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. And I figured we just watched, well, I'm

477
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,360
going to watch the video. You're going to listen to their audio. We just go through it together.

478
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:14,120
Because I'm not quite sure where my mind is at with Matt Damon. I'm, you know, when I hear

479
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:19,800
all this talk about experience and all this, you know, like any American, any American could

480
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:25,480
should be able to, and should be privileged. You shouldn't have to go to school to college

481
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,280
to university to be president of the United States. I'm just going to defend a little bit here.

482
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,720
And I'm really not liking this. You know, the same for Obama. I don't give a shit. If he's too

483
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,520
young or is only, you know, anyone can run the United States. It's more about your cabinet,

484
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:46,440
what you put around you, but it only really works if you have a healthy system. And that, of course,

485
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:52,680
we don't have. It's, uh, it's all been taken over by money. The corporations have bought and bought

486
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:59,000
every single piece of relevance and importance. Look at that. Look at the minimal management, uh,

487
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,040
service. That's how they get bought and paid for. Coke, sex, and nice work if you can get it on,

488
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:11,400
I'm not saying that ain't interesting. Here's Matt Damon. I think there's a really good chance

489
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,440
that Sarah Palin can be president. Um, and I think that's a really scary thing. Um, because I don't

490
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:22,440
know anything about her. You know, that's, so, uh, and I like Matt Damon. He's a great actor. I love

491
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:28,680
his movies, but, uh, what's got that, that's bullshit. I don't know anything about her. Well,

492
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:34,280
then you need to do your research. You know, don't rely on the news media to do the research for you.

493
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,280
That's the big mistake here. I don't think in eight weeks. I'm going to know anything about her.

494
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:44,440
Um, I know that she was a mayor of a really, really small town. Yeah. Yeah. And I just got to interject

495
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:51,480
there, too. Again, I'm, I'm against both parties. I'm not rooting or voting for anybody. If anything,

496
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:57,480
I'm going to take Dr. Ron Paul's direction and I'm going to, uh, go for a third, third party,

497
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:04,360
independent libertarian. Anything, uh, Dr. Ron Paul endorses on behind. Done. And we'll be

498
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:11,160
listening to Dr. Ron Paul in a little bit, too. Um, and she's a governor of Alaska for, for less than

499
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:17,320
two years. I just don't understand. Uh, I think the pick was made for political purposes, but in terms

500
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:24,200
of governance, it's a disaster. God, you know, this is what happens because I know Matt Damon

501
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:33,000
really means well. I really do. I think he does. But, you know, this is, this is not helping

502
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
the process. You know, and I think he was probably set up. This, of course, he only hears answers.

503
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
You don't hear the question. And it's probably about, you know, do you think that Sarah

504
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,880
Paine of the, she was vetted properly? Who cares? You do the actuary tables. You know, there's

505
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,520
a one out of three chance. If not more, that McCain doesn't survive his first term. And it will

506
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:56,120
be president, Paine. And this, and I think this is, uh, I actually this board is on sexist.

507
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,880
Because the way he's coming across when I'm watching this video is like, oh, you know, he's

508
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,600
following the talking points. You just, the heart beat away from being the president. We'd have,

509
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:13,880
we'll, we'd have a woman. Really, you know, we was talking about it earlier. It's, it's like a

510
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:21,240
really bad Disney movie. You know, the hockey mom, you know, I'm just a hockey mom from Alaska.

511
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,880
And she's the president. And it's like she's facing what, uh, what qualifications do we have to

512
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:35,160
have for the president? You know, that's, he's missing the point. He's saying exactly why

513
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:40,360
it's a genius choice. Because that's all, that's the way our system works now, which, of course,

514
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:49,160
I condemn is we only need actors. She's a perfect actor. So, Damon, Matt Damon, a couple

515
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:54,200
levels deeper, my friend. That's why she's a perfect candidate because she won't actually be

516
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:59,240
running anything. All she has to do is stand there, read the prompter of the prompter blinks off.

517
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:04,360
She has to be able to add live a little bit. That's what really, that's what the position is about.

518
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,000
Remember Ronald Reagan guy was actually an actor.

519
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:13,880
Down, Vladimir Putin. And, you know, using the, you know, the, the folksy stuff she learned at

520
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:19,800
the hockey, you know, rank, you know, it's absurd. It's totally absurd. And I don't understand why

521
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:26,920
more people aren't talking about how absurd it is. I, I, I, it's, it's a, it's a really terrifying

522
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:33,480
possibility. The fact that we've gotten this far and, and we're that close to this being a reality

523
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:39,640
is crazy. Crazy sheet. I mean, does she really, I need to know if she really thinks dinosaurs were

524
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,520
here 4,000 years ago. That's an important. I want to know that. I really do because she's going to

525
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:51,080
have the nuclear codes. You know, I want to know if she's thinking, uh, so I guess that's somehow

526
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:59,960
that's an attack on her creationist view over the world. I think that's, yeah, I think he's

527
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,560
gotten a little confused there. I don't know if she ever said anything about the dinosaurs,

528
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:08,280
not existing. The dinosaurs were here 4,000 years ago, or if she banned books, or tried to

529
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:14,040
banned books. I mean, that's, you know, we can't, we can't have that. You know, I, I bet that

530
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,240
the true owners of the earth really love people like Matt Damon talking like that. And the guy's

531
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:24,840
not doing it because he's evil or he's being paid to, to talk that way, but this is the general

532
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:31,000
perception. The general perception is that the people in the White House actually control stuff

533
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,040
actually are smart, actually make things work. No, they don't. All they do is just have to sit there,

534
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:44,520
read the teleprompter, look good. And that's also important, by the way. It's not to be underestimated.

535
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:49,960
How important it is, you know, to be a good performer when you're in that role and to carry the message.

536
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:55,400
These people don't write their speeches. You know, they really don't. But I think very few

537
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,880
speeches are ever written by the people who give them the speech writers. And that comes from

538
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:07,160
think tanks and from all kinds of lobbyists and money influencing what people are supposed to do.

539
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:16,040
But I think that, you know, I really hope Matt goes a couple of level levels deeper.

540
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,320
Because right now, he's, he's pretty much sounding like, you know, an ages sexist Democrat.

541
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:35,000
That's just my take on it. Okay. And let me see, you know what, it's Friday,

542
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,560
which means it's time once again for the handy work of young people.

543
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,680
Hey, Adam, how are you doing?

544
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,680
It's just hit us number 138. All right. And this is intro number one.

545
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:03,320
Oh, I think I'm going to like this week. I would say that's trapped by Colonel Abrams.

546
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,720
Another 80s show. Yannes that we're up to.

547
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,520
Number two.

548
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,440
Clarence Plyman.

549
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,480
Clarence Plyman.

550
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,480
Oh, man. Is it Clarence?

551
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:21,640
No, Clarence, Clarence Plyman's, you're a friend of mine, with a duet with someone.

552
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:30,120
And this is number three, Ice House, something with girl in it.

553
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,400
Oh crap. I think I get four out of six. I can't quite complete all three answers.

554
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,240
And it's time for the answers.

555
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:41,880
All right. And this is answer number one.

556
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,320
Now let's just go to Abrams and track.

557
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,920
I'm sick of you.

558
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,400
Colonel Abrams is answering number one.

559
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,960
And this is answer number two.

560
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,680
Clarence Plyman. And Jackson Brown, you're a friend of mine.

561
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,120
I need you.

562
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,120
Now, let's track it out.

563
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,760
Welcome back again.

564
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,120
And you can't call on me.

565
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,520
Oh, but you're the same.

566
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:35,480
You're the one who gives me so many more.

567
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,960
All right. I need to get the Jackson Brown part.

568
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,280
I'm an accountant, anyway. I'll say four. Four points.

569
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,440
Look, I'm Clarence Plyman. Clarence Plyman is in Jackson Brown.

570
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,880
You're a friend of mine, answer number two.

571
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,280
And this is answer number three. Crazy.

572
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,760
This is Ice House. Crazy.

573
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,760
Yes. I just remembered.

574
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,640
Crazy baby.

575
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,920
Ice House has answered number three.

576
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,200
And that concludes it. Number one, third, eight.

577
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,520
Go. So, Adam, how did you do this week?

578
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,880
I think because I came in under the wire before you give me the title.

579
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,720
I think I got six out of six. I'm feeling good on the football Friday.

580
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:39,000
Alrighty, hit this. Let me feel that calm is the place to find the answers to each and every hitest.

581
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,080
And also the links to iTunes, you can buy the tracks featured on the hitest online.

582
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,240
Thank you for playing, Adam.

583
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,000
And for now, special listening. Next week, I'll help you be back for another hitest.

584
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,560
So until then, have fun, take care and try to remember.

585
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,080
Think with your hearts. Bye bye.

586
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,760
And some of the things that happen here, tell you a little bit about what's going on.

587
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,600
Tell you what to do or not to do.

588
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,600
Things to avoid and things to enjoy.

589
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,320
Every couple of weeks or so, I focus on something.

590
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,480
It quintessentially London.

591
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,960
Quite often, I'll be taking my nose into place.

592
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,600
His where tourists went normally go to.

593
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:37,640
Trying to get under the skin of what's going on here and helping people understand.

594
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:42,200
Where we London as are coming from and why we live in this magnificent city.

595
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,840
You can find the show at www this week in London.co.uk.

596
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,840
Come by. Have a listen.

597
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,840
Tell me what you think. Bye bye.

598
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,760
It's my city as well. Now, of course, now that we're living in good old blighty.

599
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,160
And I want to talk a little bit about what's going on over here in the UK

600
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,640
because we talked enough about America for the time being.

601
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,640
Something that I noticed quite interesting when I was doing the Dutch radio show.

602
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,160
The government started talking about vaccinations and

603
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:19,880
notculation for 12 year old girls against cervical cancer.

604
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,040
And I had quite a discussion about this on the radio because I said,

605
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:28,760
you know, first of all, I don't like the idea of the government injecting anything into my child

606
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,520
period, particularly if I don't know exactly what's in it.

607
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,120
And the amount of people or girls that die from cervical cancer or women,

608
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:43,880
I should say, young women, is reasonably low on the scale of deadly diseases.

609
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,040
But it's also something that is passed on by sexual contact.

610
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:53,960
And, you know, so we had a pretty big debate about this and just, you know, I don't want to

611
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,720
get cancer. I don't know anything about cancer doesn't seem like anyone actually knows anything about

612
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:02,840
cancer, what causes or how you can stop it or how you treat it. My mom passed away from cancer.

613
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:07,720
But still, I am really against the government sticking needles in us, okay?

614
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,040
And so I saw this commercial last night on television here in the UK.

615
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:16,040
And it was like, it was like, hey, I got up, I had a really, you know, it's a teenage girl in

616
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:20,920
our bedroom. Like, I'm checking my my space and looking at my Facebook, I'm going to school,

617
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:26,680
I get a little jab, I'm really cool. It's called the Arm against cervical cancer.

618
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,080
And it's showing school girls who are really happy and they're smiling in there.

619
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,360
And they've got little tattoos that say Arm against cervical cancer.

620
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:40,840
And the vaccination program is coming to England in autumn of 2008. They're going to start

621
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:49,240
jabbing needles into our young girls over here. And I'm very, very, very afraid of it.

622
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:57,080
And you know that it's, it's, it's either the, uh, pharmaceutical countries because it's not

623
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:01,960
by coincidence that this is being brought up in the Netherlands and in the UK. And I'll bet

624
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,600
friends in Europe, chuckle heads out there in Germany, France, Switzerland.

625
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:13,560
Some of the Scandinavian regions, everybody. Tell me, is this happening in your country as well?

626
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:20,760
So a, it could be part of a pharmaceutical plot to make money on something which I believe is

627
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,040
probably unnecessary.

628
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:35,640
Um, or it's, uh, it's a way to shoot bad ass shit at our monomass scale into our children.

629
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:42,360
Or a combination of both, which is probably the most likely. And it's just highly suspicious to me.

630
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:47,640
I don't know anything about this new HPV vaccine. Well, hey, let me click on it.

631
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:53,320
Here it is, about the HPV vaccine. All you need to know about the new HPV vaccine that helps protect

632
00:57:53,320 --> 00:58:00,360
against the main cause of cervical cancer. This vaccine protects against the two strains of HPV

633
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:05,080
16 and 18 that cause cervical cancer and over 70% of women does not protect, protect against any

634
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:11,880
other sexually transmitted infections or against pregnancy. Because the HPV vaccine does not protect

635
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,960
against all cervical cancers, it's really important for all girls to have cervical screening

636
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,960
later in life. Well, how about just doing that?

637
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:24,520
cervical screening, by the way, is offered in England from age 25. So you can't, you can, they're

638
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:31,160
going to force you to take a shot when you're 12, but you can't actually get cervical screening

639
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:38,120
until you're 25. How messed up is that? That's all they say about it. Uh, and let me see,

640
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:44,920
well, the surgery would be now we stop, which vaccine and how effective, how long is it last, doesn't

641
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,640
say what's in it? Nothing. Please download leaflets, posters, CR campaign materials.

642
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:59,160
Just shudder when I think of all this stuff. Okay, but that wasn't the really big news this past week.

643
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:08,200
The big news this past week in the United Kingdom was the trial of, well, they tried to convict

644
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:16,120
seven of these so-called al-Qaeda or operatives with links to al-Qaeda. We're going to

645
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:23,720
blow up aircraft on their way to the United States over the ocean. And they could only convict

646
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:27,800
three of them, the ringleader, the main guy, they, they, they, they'd let him go entirely.

647
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:34,200
And there's, uh, there's a lot of news articles about this and actually a pretty good aggregation,

648
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:42,280
um, let me see, this is on a site called on, on anger fan, I guess, WNGIRFAN.

649
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:47,640
But it has links to all these mainstream news articles. So of course you'll find this link in the

650
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:53,080
show notes a daily source code.com. And what I like about it is they have the actual,

651
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:54,920
here we go.

652
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:03,240
Uh, so there's a lot of, so in this, a lot of links about how it wouldn't have worked in the first place

653
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:08,680
is not actually, you know, uh, really feasible to take on the right liquids and mix them up in the

654
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:14,360
plane to create a bomb. Um, here we go.

655
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:27,080
I'm looking for the names here. Well, Muhammad goals are, uh, exonerate of all charges. The jury

656
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:34,440
failed to reach any verdict verdict on the four remaining defendants. Uh, Erifat was Wahid Khan,

657
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:43,080
Abraham Savand Savand, Wahid Savand and Umar Islam. Abdullah Ahmed Ali, Assad,

658
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:50,680
so Sarwar and Tanvir Hussein claimed, and they were convicted, claimed they were merely planning

659
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:57,000
a non-lethal explosion in London as a publicity stunt to draw attention to a supposed document

660
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,760
tree they are preparing on the plate of Muslims in Afghanistan in Iraq.

661
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:08,280
Pretty stupid idea if you ask me, want you higher a PR agent, but the jury and here it comes,

662
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:15,720
the jury could not, could not find these three of the eight, I guess it is, guilty of trying to blow

663
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:22,760
of aircraft. They actually didn't have a bomb, they didn't have tickets, many of them didn't have

664
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:31,720
passports. And what this, uh, what this aggregation of content suggests is, uh, that it was, uh,

665
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:38,120
the CIA's idea, um, to create more fear and anguish by saying, oh, they were going to blow

666
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:45,320
up planes with liquids. And so it turns out it's just not true and thank goodness, uh, Virgin Atlantic,

667
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:51,000
my favorite airline is awake. And they said, hey, you know what, uh, if, uh, if these guys didn't

668
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:55,720
actually do it, if they weren't really trying to blow up planes with liquids, if it turns out

669
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:02,920
there's pretty much impossible to do, could we please get rid of the stupid ass security idiocy?

670
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:08,840
And I want you all to think about this because a lot of people are already, and myself included

671
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:13,320
to some degree, you automatically think to yourself, you know what, we should lift that restriction,

672
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,280
let's get rid of it. But somewhere in the back of the mind, you're mind you're going,

673
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:20,600
but you know what, I feel really safe because I now know no, no one can actually pull that off, you

674
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:31,880
know, it's bullshit. It's bullshit. Okay. It's not going to happen. And let me keep my shoes on at

675
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:36,280
the same time while we're at it. Will you please? Just let me get on the flying bus already.

676
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:45,320
And, and give the crew some weapons. So guys with box cutters, a little peony knives don't

677
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:52,360
hijack us and fly us into buildings. There's your Disneyland movie, Matt Damon. That's the real

678
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:59,320
Disney movie. So now, of course, the you, and this is amazing to me. I don't know how this works.

679
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:08,120
I'm not familiar with with UK law, but I don't, I do know that we discussed the elimination

680
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:14,680
in the European Union of double jeopardy, meaning if you're convicted of a crime, you can never

681
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:21,080
be tried or if you're let off. You can never be tried for that crime again. And here it is

682
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:26,600
the BBC prosecutors are seeking a retrial of the seven British men who were accused of a plot

683
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:32,760
to blow up planes flying from the UK to North America with liquid bombs. Three men were found

684
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,920
guilty of the conspiracy to murder, but the jury was unable to decide whether they and four other

685
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:42,440
men had planned to target planes. So they don't like the outcome. Take them back to court.

686
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:50,200
Is that legal? Is that how it works? Let's see who's talking here.

687
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:55,000
Director of Public Prosecution Sir Ken McDonald said this will include a count

688
01:03:55,720 --> 01:04:00,200
that each defendant conspired to detonate improvised explosive devices on transatlantic

689
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,720
passenger aircraft. They're going to vote. They didn't like the outcome. There's your

690
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:07,160
justice system in the United Kingdom. So we're just going to go back and I'm sure they're going to

691
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:14,040
rig it now. He added he had reached the decision after careful consideration with heads of counter-terrorism

692
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:24,280
divisions and counsel. Yeah, no shit. You guys look stupid. So the three of those guys,

693
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:29,400
they are being convicted. I mean, let's be honest. It's not okay to put together videos that say

694
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:36,600
we're going to blow the shit up and then go buy fertilizer and other ingredients. But the rest,

695
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:41,160
it seems was just made up and I don't want you to forget this. It was made up

696
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:51,880
and we're suffering because of it. It's crazy. All right, more UK news and I got to tell you.

697
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:59,000
I have actually gotten into into a place where I went shopping with the lady Patricia over the

698
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,720
weekend and said, I'm going to come with you because we're going to go get a lot of stuff. She said,

699
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:05,960
why is it? Well, you know, I don't know, man, a lot of people talking about a possible food crisis

700
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:12,440
you know, it could just imagine like if we didn't have any milk or bread. I mean, that it's

701
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:17,640
not the end of the world, but you'd be pretty upset. They could be messed up and by the way,

702
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:22,440
the wheat harvest in the United Kingdom has been destroyed by the weather. Literally destroyed

703
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:27,800
what was harvested is now going to cost three times as much as normal and they're going to have

704
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:33,080
to import wheat from, well, actually Germany had a banner year. They did better than ever. But,

705
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:37,640
that's going to make your bread really expensive and wheat goes into a lot of other things.

706
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:49,720
And now Britain, according to the express, is quite simply running out of power. This is the

707
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:56,280
stark warning from the head of an energy think tank, so that makes it suspicious, but still who believes

708
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:02,360
when I should finish the story about the wheat. So I bought a whole bunch of flour and dehydrated

709
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:09,640
milk and canned goods and dehydrated, freeze dried coffee. I just want to have some food.

710
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:17,080
If shit starts flying off the shelves and the cupboards are bare, I want our pantry to be stocked

711
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:23,000
at least for a couple of weeks. And the reason I get to this next story, because I'm also thinking,

712
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,880
I should probably buy a generator, a diesel generator, which by the way, I've done the research

713
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,760
very hard to get these days. It's much easier to get a gasoline power generator, but a diesel generator,

714
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:41,160
which you can easily run on any type of bio diesel, or a, you know, seeds, or hemp oil. I mean,

715
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:46,600
you can come up with a bad situation. You come up with a lot of things you can use in a diesel engine.

716
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:51,640
Because of this story, so this is the stark warning from the head of the energy think tank,

717
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:56,200
of these power cuts could be serious enough to spark civil disorder. Okay, this is mainstream news.

718
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:00,840
Campbell Dunford of the respected renewable energy foundation said,

719
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:04,680
it's almost too late to do anything about it. Nothing will stop us having to pay very high prices

720
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:09,640
for power in the future already taking place. British gas and energy just raised their prices by

721
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:15,400
an a published average of 30% as sure it's going to be much higher. Here comes a great English quote,

722
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:21,000
if we pull our finger out now, we can limit blackouts, but it's going to be pretty grim whatever happens.

723
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,760
To their expecting, I guess, a form of rolling blackouts.

724
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:31,160
Only last Thursday, the National Great Issue to an urgent call for power after a series of

725
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:38,040
power station breakdowns. Who was this released? September 7th. I didn't even know about this.

726
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:42,680
Suppliers were asked to bring all of their available generating capacity online, including

727
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:49,880
the costly oil fired stations in May. And I do remember this hundreds of thousands of people in

728
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:54,920
Cleveland, Cheshire, Lincolnshire, and London suffered blackouts when seven power stations were

729
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:59,560
closed. By the way, no, follow up on that story. You think the news media is going to go and

730
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:05,160
ask more questions. No, no, no, the way too busy with the, what was it? The National Movie Awards.

731
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:13,160
All important stuff. Gary Glitter. Yeah, we got to go do an in-depth. Let's go to Thailand and do

732
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:18,040
in-depth the in Vietnam in that investigation. I'm Gary Glitter, but don't actually go and find out

733
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:30,840
what these cock suckers are doing. Spit on my microphone, sorry. So one more here. This is not

734
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:37,320
specifically about the UK, but is about the European Union. And this really sums up a whole bunch of

735
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:44,760
articles about ID cards being ushered in. You could really, you could just go read 1984 by George

736
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:50,360
Orwell. And you'll, that's the news. That's the news over here. I'm trying to load this page from

737
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:59,960
the telegraph over here in the UK, mainstream media news reporting. You're going to love this.

738
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:11,000
60 page report published yesterday, the seventh anniversary of September 11th said that the

739
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,400
European Union now sees data privacy and judicial scrutiny of police surveillance tactics as just

740
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:23,000
obstacles to efficient law enforcement cooperation, rather than rights to be safeguarded.

741
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:28,840
The report, which is the shape of things to come, is described as a EU future group,

742
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:35,320
preparing a five-year security strategy that is being in the works right now. They're calling this

743
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:43,480
very, very shadowy. State Watch report quotes EU councils of ministers, council of ministers,

744
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:50,840
document on justice and security, which declared every object, the individual uses, every transaction

745
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:56,600
they make, and almost every there, everywhere they will go will create a detailed digital record.

746
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:02,360
This will generate a wealth of information for public security organizations and create huge

747
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:06,600
opportunities for more effective and productive public security efforts.

748
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:15,320
They're even offering kids. You don't need all these. The EU is fucked, man. This Lisbon Treaty

749
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:19,960
which will take place. They are going to ram it down our throats. Ireland stands strong.

750
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:25,320
We're all behind you. No means no, Ireland. They're still going to try and ram it down our throats.

751
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:32,600
And that'll be it. We've been sold. We've been sold off. All these global European laws

752
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:36,280
coming into effect share all of our data for security reasons.

753
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:44,280
Remember, though, the freedom exists between your ears. That's where my freedom is right now.

754
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:53,400
And nothing really, nothing really political, but there was a big fire in the channel tunnel

755
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:59,080
which was like he was really here about on the news. They don't have any video, of course,

756
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:06,760
which means it only gets 20 seconds of attention. But there were explosions and truck gas tanks going

757
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:11,240
off and people had to escape through escape tunnels. And this fire burned for quite a while.

758
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:16,520
And the the channel has been shut down. They say it might open today. But that's pretty serious.

759
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:22,280
And what's interesting is that not a single person is saying, couldn't that been of terrorist attack?

760
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,960
I haven't heard that at all. There's no video, of course, which doesn't make it

761
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,920
interesting enough for them to even get that far in their thinking. But what was it? Will we ever

762
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:39,400
knew? Will we ever know? Will they ever report on it? Probably not. But that's what our independent

763
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,800
media is for. Has this ever happened to you?

764
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:51,800
Welcome to the rock and roll diner. What will it be? Hey, they're gorgeous. What's the special?

765
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:57,640
Nickelback with a side order of follow-up boy in 6am. Same old stuff. Sounds like the same

766
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:03,000
special from yesterday. Oh, it's some new. Got anything I haven't tried yet?

767
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Well, have you tried the love and the club with a side of some shot to get loose?

768
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:14,360
Yeah, give me gas. Have you got any independent dishes? No. Yeah, us and the tavern on the green.

769
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:18,040
You know, we've just got the same old same old. No, what'll it be?

770
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:25,880
Are you looking for something new and fresh? Are you constantly bombarded with the beat?

771
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:31,880
They love to repeat? Well, now there's a choice. Indy Radio Chat Nuke. We've taken over the

775
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:59,080
You've got to emerge into a society of this thing that's called the state. What is the state?

776
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:05,880
The state is important as you are to see. It is the whole needs department.

777
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:10,920
It is the argument of the negative. It represents the system of the courts and what have you.

778
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:16,040
This is the state that is a impressive organization. But the state.

779
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:41,240
I thought my talk I care about the pre-thinking. You know how we think. Organize the hood.

780
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:45,320
On the ice shing battles. Red black and green. Instead of gang bad dancers.

781
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:49,480
FBI's final in the school. The radio and channels in the head and cameras in the street.

782
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:53,640
Like watch your society. We know it's back for the people's right. The privacy.

783
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,040
I take a slug for the cause. Like who you peed.

784
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,800
Or all you fake niggas try to copy master tea. I want to be free to live.

785
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:03,240
Ain't what I have. What I need to live. Bring the power back to the street.

786
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,840
Where the people live. He's taking words with crumbs and filling up the prisons.

787
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:12,200
Don't know what money and rely on. We live for help. We do the stuff like ants in a colony.

788
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:17,080
Organize the world for your socialist economy. Or where a life based off the comedy.

789
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,800
And on my comrades is ready. He just threatened to see.

790
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:23,480
I have a black man. There was a third of his life in the jail.

791
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,360
Because the world is the control of our white man.

792
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,080
And the people don't know what he just did.

793
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,720
And the women don't know what he just did.

794
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:34,360
And the problems don't know what he's called.

795
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:37,160
And the jobs don't know what he's called.

796
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,480
So the red always be late.

797
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,000
And you're late.

798
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,600
And there's no more bondage. No more political monsters.

799
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,840
There's no more secrets, face launches.

800
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,320
Government departments started it in the projects.

801
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:52,120
Materials, you objects, thousands up in the closet.

802
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,760
Could have been invested in the future for my comrades.

803
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,480
Battle contacts, primitive weapons out in combat.

804
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,360
Many never come back. Pretty niggas be running with gas.

805
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,520
Ravi gets shot and they back and fight you back.

806
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,080
Retired of that. Corporations high and black.

807
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,640
The nine effect is floating us all over the map.

808
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,720
I fly right to shit. I ride in my raft.

809
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,160
It's documented I'm in it.

810
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,960
Every day in the week I live in it, breathe in it.

811
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,960
It's morning to fucking believe in it.

812
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,680
I'm holding them ones rolling up my sleeves and shit.

813
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,280
It's the low who pushed up now.

814
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,040
Many had it but one concludes it.

815
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,640
Lick is ain't ready for rebel.

816
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,000
I have a black man.

817
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,240
Never third of his life in the jail.

818
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:30,360
Then I've got a world that's controlled by a white man.

819
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:33,080
And if people don't never get justice.

820
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,800
And the women don't know you just back there.

821
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,440
And the problems don't never get solved.

822
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,000
And the jobs don't never pay enough.

823
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,240
For the rent always be late.

824
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,680
Can you relate?

825
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,680
They've been in a holy state.

826
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:24,760
Yeah, dead president was a police state.

827
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:35,480
It's still pretty much hip hop and metal.

828
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,480
This really passing a message along.

829
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,120
It's not what's going on in coming.

830
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:45,640
Where are the days when our superstars were, I guess I can't happen anymore, huh?

831
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:49,320
When the big label artists that just can't put this stuff out anymore, the labels are

832
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:55,200
fused to release the politically tinted stuff, their true messages.

833
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,800
And they can't even put it out independently because then they'll still get in trouble with

834
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,760
their labels.

835
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:06,240
I think the last one and boy, he was ridiculed for, remember George Michael and he came out

836
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,960
with the song, I can't remember the song now.

837
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,200
I don't think it was a huge success.

838
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,240
He might have gone top 10 or top 5 after all.

839
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:19,120
It was a video with it and Blair was a Tony Blair, was like a little lap dog for George

840
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:24,160
Bush and people ridiculed him, totally ridiculed him.

841
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,120
And he was right, of course.

842
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,800
And they were laughing at him, too.

843
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,040
They were just laughing, I mean, what are you doing?

844
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,120
You crazy get.

845
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,840
And of course they got him, right?

846
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,840
They embarrassed him.

847
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,400
Okay, I promise you some Ron Paul.

848
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:51,600
And this is from C-Span, I really like this because it's about Georgia and about the billion

849
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,720
dollars in aid that has been pledged to Georgia.

850
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:58,320
Now, of course, you have to understand that this billion dollars doesn't actually go into

851
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,920
the pockets of the Georgians, it's a credit.

852
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:07,760
So the big companies, Boeing, Lockheed, Rand Corporation, they'll take that money and they're going

853
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,400
to build infrastructure in Georgia.

854
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,880
I'm going to get into that a little bit until you why they want infrastructure in Georgia.

855
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,880
You might want, if you're not in the car, if you're at the office, or if you're at home,

856
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,840
just go ahead and fire up Google Earth or even Google Maps and go find the region.

857
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,680
Okay, go look for Georgia.

858
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,280
You'll probably get a couple of results, it's not the one in the United States, obviously.

859
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,200
But go look at Georgia, look at the companies that neighbor it, look at its relationship to

860
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,760
Russia and primarily Iran.

861
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,920
While we listen to a little bit of Dr. Ron Paul asking the tough questions.

862
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:49,840
Has expired the gentleman from Texas, and this is actually the U.S. Russia relations.

863
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,840
That's what the C-Span2 has as the lower third the title,

864
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,520
their after conflict with Georgia.

865
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,800
All is recognized.

866
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:57,760
Thank you Mr. Chairman.

867
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:05,280
I understand we're sending aid to Georgia right now humanitarian aid in a military vessel, military ship.

868
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:13,840
If we're not the provocateurs, why would we use a military ship instead of a non-military

869
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,040
ship? What's the purpose of that if it isn't to provoke?

870
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:24,880
We've used military ships to provide assistance after the tsunami in Asia.

871
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,840
We've used...

872
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:31,840
This is Daniel Fried. He's the Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs.

873
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:36,160
You got to see this video, links in the show notes, of course, dailysourcecode.com.

874
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:44,080
You'll look at this guy. If you actually believe in the whole reptilian story about the

875
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:49,920
leaders being reptiles and shape-shifters, you'll love this guy. He does look like some kind of evil

876
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:56,000
reptile. Listen to the lies that come out of his mouth. Listen, I'm going to just back this up just a

877
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:02,800
little bit here. Listen to the lies. Remember, it's documented and reported in mainstream media,

878
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:10,000
although not the headlines every single day, that Georgia attacked South Assetia first.

879
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:17,280
Before Russia came to South Assetia's aid, most of those people being Russians hold us a Russian

880
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:25,280
passport. Listen to the lies. Listen to the words. The code that he uses to skirt around

881
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:31,520
the truth. The tsunami in Asia, we've used military planes to provide humanitarian assistance.

882
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:36,240
So it's actually fairly standard procedure, not any kind of provocative act at all.

883
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:47,040
And we didn't regard it as a provocation. Certainly, it is perfectly normal to have relations with

884
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:53,600
Georgia to deliver humanitarian assistance in a standard way. It is after all the Russians who have

885
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:59,840
crossed an international border to attack Georgia the other way around. Let me have you pause for

886
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:04,160
a minute because obviously there's a disagreement on that. Certainly in world press, there's a

887
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:11,040
lot of disagreement on who did the invading first, but we'll not settle that here. But I think we should

888
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:18,320
all... I just love Dr. Ron Paul. I love you, man. Absolutely. World press has reported on it

889
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:25,200
and Dr. Ron's even smoking. Unfortunately, I'd like to know where do we actually have that

890
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:31,280
conversation? Can we have that conversation about who made the first strike? Is there a committee

891
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:37,760
for that? Breathe that when you give humanitarian aid, it's essentially military aid because all

892
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,720
funds are fungible and it just happens that the Georgians in their budget last year spend 70

893
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:48,560
percent of their money on the military and they got a lot of assistance from us. So this idea that's

894
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:54,240
humanitarian aid and not military aid, I think, distracts from what's really going on there.

895
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:58,000
But I was just wondering whether every bothers you or concerns you are the question,

896
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:05,600
every cross is your mind about, say, humanitarian aid to a country like this. What about,

897
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:10,400
what about the people in this country? We have a lot of poor people, not getting medical care,

898
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:15,600
not getting food and a billion dollars. What the heck? What's that of another billion?

899
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:22,000
Does it ever cross your mind that maybe that should be helping our people here and this,

900
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:27,120
this is getting us in the trouble? This isn't helping. This is making us less safe.

901
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:32,640
This is part of this empire. You might refer to it as our sphere of influence, but

902
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:37,840
everybody knows it's our empire, but does it ever cross your mind that everything that we do over there

903
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:42,640
and every nickel you take, you're taking it away from some poor people in this country that could have

904
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:48,800
been helped? I love the way he's putting that because in order to get through to people who are

905
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:54,000
brainwashed and mind control, which is 99% of the population, present company excluded, of course.

906
01:22:54,800 --> 01:23:00,960
You got to throw it if that's so unfortunate, because really what he wants to say is,

907
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:06,000
dude, you're actually when I'm buying, we're giving money, we're selling, we're going to be

908
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:12,560
selling weapons to Georgia. And the reason why is because we want to, or we, the Bush,

909
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:21,280
Cheney and the evil owners of the planet, want to set up a front, a long rush, so they've

910
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:29,600
gotten your Cheney was in in Georgia. He was also in Azerbaijan, in the Ukraine, and they're building

911
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:35,360
up the plan. I'm pretty sure it was to build up a base in Georgia. And that's where the jets and

912
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:40,560
everything else could fly out and go bum around. And why else do you think that we're now moving

913
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:46,400
all of our troops out of Iraq enough, Afghanistan? Go, look at the map, go, look at the map.

914
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,120
I got some other interesting info about that in the minute, but let's just hear a little bit more from

915
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:56,560
Dr. Ron and this reptilian. I don't think of it that way, no sir.

916
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:02,960
Secondly, as a matter of fact, Georgia did not attack Russia. There's no question about that.

917
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:09,600
Russia attacked Georgia. Georgia sent in its forces into a part of Georgia, the breakaway province of

918
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:15,120
South of Session. Those are the basic facts. I don't know about Georgia spending 70% of

919
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:20,320
how do you like that? You just sat there and he lied and you hear Ron Paul laughing. This guy just

920
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:25,520
looking at Ron Paul and I got to roll that back. It looks like he has an actual smirk on his space

921
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:34,880
this guy. No, no, no, no, no. Georgia didn't attack Russia. It's fucking lying. It's proof. We know

922
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:39,680
it. It's been reported on. How can this guy just sit there and get away with these lies?

923
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:44,880
Or did it not attack Russia? There is no question about that. Russia attacked Georgia.

924
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:50,400
Georgia sent in its forces into a part of Georgia, the breakaway province of South of Session.

925
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:56,320
Those are the basic facts. I don't know about Georgia spending 70% of its budget on the military.

926
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:03,520
That doesn't sound quite right to me. And with respect to assistance priorities at home and abroad,

927
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:10,240
Sir, the same could be said for any form of foreign assistance anywhere. The question is,

928
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:16,880
is it in the American interest to support a small country, a struggling democracy that wants

929
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:24,720
to be a friend that has helped us out in Iraq? You're hearing the lies right here?

930
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:30,640
It has been attacked by a much larger country. The strategic stakes here are fairly high.

931
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:38,880
The administration believes it is in our interest to support Georgia, to help it get on its feet,

932
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:45,600
to prevent Russia from drawing a new line in Europe, and claiming it's here of influence.

933
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:49,280
And in the long run, we want to consider our relations with Russia.

934
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:55,280
Nothing to those words, sphere of influence, new line in Europe. It's all about

935
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,520
oil.

936
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:04,000
Under any harsh or in each earthquake, that carefully, if I'm sorry, but I only have a minute.

937
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,600
And I understand your point, but let me tell you, there are a lot of people in America

938
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:16,160
do not see this in our interest. They see it in the interest of some very powerful, special interest

939
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:21,360
groups that have an oil pipeline going through there. There's a lot of fact, most Americans

940
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,360
couldn't even find Georgia on a map.

941
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:27,120
Yeah, that's not the chuckleheads because they're the looking right now, Dr. Ron.

942
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:31,040
To convince them that this is crucial to spend all this money,

943
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:36,640
provoking the Russians, leading us into another conflict that we're not even capable of handling

944
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:40,800
militarily. Now unless we use some very big bombs. But we are true.

945
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,240
I don't even need to use big bombs because we've got the new secret weapons.

946
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:51,280
Secret weapons. Wasn't it Hitler near the end of his demise?

947
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:55,680
When he started talking about having super weapons and you can't get us,

948
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:01,840
you can't get me. I've got the super gun super weapons. Secret weapons

949
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,680
is history repeating itself, is that what President Bush is now doing?

950
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:13,200
Just spread around the world. And this has been exactly the plan of some of our enemies to do

951
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:18,400
exactly this and bring us to our knees. And all we do is proceed to continue to spend and

952
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:23,280
spread our troops around, diminishing our ability to take care of our people here at home.

953
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,400
And I yield back the balance of my time. Yeah, right on, Dr. Ron.

954
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:32,400
Right on. Okay, Russia today, of course, highly skewed.

955
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,920
But it's a very interesting report this came out today.

956
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:42,240
A title, of course, I catching U.S. to invade Iran any day now.

957
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:52,640
Well, here's the deal. It's going to scroll down here and find this. Okay, so the reporter

958
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:58,560
is talking about a friend who had been in Kandahar in Afghanistan.

959
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:05,040
And it would seem American battle tanks being unloaded from a Ukrainian registered onton off.

960
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:11,760
Onton off is the biggest plane in the world. And it can carry tanks with a lot of them. Remember

961
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:19,840
Ukraine, that's where Cheney just was. So all these tanks are being offloaded from an onton off,

962
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:28,400
which was registered to the Ukraine. Okay, you with me. So you've got tanks coming into Afghanistan.

963
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:35,120
Now, please go look at your Google Earth and, you know, Google for Afghanistan.

964
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:39,920
And actually, you know, how you can tilt Google Earth. Well, this is fun. You can do this.

965
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:46,880
Tilt Google Earth. And you'll see that it's mountains. It is terrain that is completely unsuitable for tanks.

966
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,160
So as this article continues, this friend asked if I had any idea what tanks would be

967
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:57,200
good for. And Afghanistan, I said, I didn't. It's an established fact that the Soviet,

968
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:02,800
from the Soviet war in Afghanistan, tanks are no good for most of the country's mountainous territory.

969
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:11,760
The good for flatlands. Now, back to the Earth. What do you see as a flat region right across

970
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:20,880
the border with Afghanistan? It's Iran. So we've got ships rolling into the Black Sea. We've got

971
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:29,760
tanks rolling out in Afghanistan. This is war. And obviously, Georgia was a perfect,

972
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:40,400
perfect place for an airfield. You can see this. You have to be see international airport,

973
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:46,640
which I think is a George W. Bush highway, no kidding, which which runs off into the airport.

974
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:52,880
And if you use Google Earth, you can see about maybe it's 20, 30 miles away. There's an airport.

975
01:29:52,880 --> 01:30:00,960
There's two more airports. Perfect spot to put your fighters. And I think that what happened is

976
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:09,360
Kashvili, he got a little overzealous. And I don't know what went on there. But he's looking at

977
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:16,560
the way he's eaten up his ties. He definitely screwed something up. So keep your eye on it because

978
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:21,040
it makes sense now. When you hear about all this, oh, we're losing out against the Taliban,

979
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:26,080
we're losing out against the Taliban. We got to move all our troops in Afghanistan. It's not true.

980
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:31,200
They're getting ready to attack Iran. We've got the ships in the Black Sea. We've got the tanks

981
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:35,920
and Afghanistan, which means they ride right across the border into the flatlands of Iran.

982
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:41,120
And we are keeping our eyes on it because even between our ears, my fellow chuckleheads, that's

983
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:50,560
where we are still truly free. Hi, I am Dina, 25 years old. I am looking for man for long-term

984
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:59,360
relations. I am from Russia. I live in St. Petersburg, Dina. It's Hypernonsense.

985
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:05,600
It's very agile, man. I think. It's kind of funny. But it's so kind of long-term relations.

986
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,760
I like that.

987
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:13,360
Long-term relations over say, long-term relations ship. Yeah, but long-term relations.

988
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,960
Chris invited the fly back and forth to St. Petersburg. They'd be a long-term relations, just try to get there.

989
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:25,280
That's great. Hypernonsense.com.

990
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:44,400
It's so cold. I don't go. I don't go.

991
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:53,360
I don't go in. You have to speak the truth. You have to speak your mind.

992
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:02,160
Every time I speak my mind, I'm literally critical. The pinnacle of being revolutionarily pivotal

993
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:08,000
beyond anything ever-study that's metaphysical. Man, fuck am I nervous? I'm not politically

994
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:14,800
minimal, but obviously terminology that is statistical. A manufactured to be unequivocally subliminal.

995
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:21,040
Transmitted by monopolized media visuals. So I'll riddle hypercritically pitiful criminals.

996
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:27,520
Habitually utilizing typical rituals with false pretence in attempts to be spiritual,

997
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:33,840
to individuals who believe in biblical miracles instead of themselves. Because they're not thinking original

998
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:40,160
and the color of their skin makes them feel invisible. Like microscopic miscarriages lynched with the

999
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:45,840
umbilical only a fucking ambasile would think they're uncharacterable. Because you're susceptible to

1000
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:51,280
becoming more than a spectacle. Remember that your flesh and blood and your body's dissectable.

1001
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:56,880
I'll beat you until you're reversible and wake up in a hospital covered in poisonous chemicals

1002
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:02,240
and a fetal position with your face only at testicles. Thinking that you were kidnapped by

1003
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:08,640
extraterrestrial. You got heart on the blood that pumps in your ventricles. Technique. I'm like

1004
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:14,960
your soul nigger indispensable with no respect for those who cover at the hour of revolution.

1005
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:21,360
Because the government owes my people restitution instead of sedatives like cocaine and prostitution.

1006
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:26,160
Conclusion is that you'll have to violently silence me because I raid the airwaves and

1007
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:32,800
control piracy. In school my teachers blinded me. But now I can see. Now I mentally and revolution

1008
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:38,880
never leave free, broadening horizons about what my people could be. If we wasn't set up to get

1009
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:45,920
shot locked to OD, you see families bleed because of corporate greed and monopolizing weed is virtually

1010
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:51,680
impossible. So it won't be legalized and that's another obstacle. But I'm still rolling up pocket

1011
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:57,440
full of tropical. The government's involved directly. So it's unstoppable like a nuclear rocket full

1012
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:03,440
of biochemical toxins that invade the ecological improbable. That the average intellect could

1013
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:08,880
understand. So I encrypted this into hip hop that's in high demand and spread it through the

1014
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:15,040
ghetto of every city like contraband. Storm for men of any complexion with a devilish nature.

1015
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:18,400
Because I'm trying to save the earth but you're just getting in line to rape.

1016
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:24,240
I gotta tell you. That is pretty much the final thought of the week. I couldn't have said it any

1017
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:28,320
better. And by the way, it's not just our black and our brown brothers and sisters who are feeding

1018
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:35,120
this. It's everybody. Everybody on the planet is enslaved and under control of thugs.

1019
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:42,960
Absolute money, grubbing, horing, thieving, coke snorting, population controlling thugs.

1020
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:49,120
And it starts at the top with the true owners of the earth and they're in trouble. Now

1021
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:54,800
I'm talking about Rockefeller. I'm talking about Rothschild. I'm talking about Warburg. I'm

1022
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:59,280
talking about the next level down. You've got the Lehman. You've got Merrill.

1023
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:06,320
You've got to watch the mutual. You've got Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac. You look at what's happening.

1024
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:11,600
Don't forget what's happening with the mineral management system. Taking drugs and sex and

1025
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:18,240
booze and parties and trips for money and exchange for favorable contracts for oil. It's oil,

1026
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:24,880
drugs and gold in that order with drugs moving up quickly to number one because

1027
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:32,080
the oil is just getting harder to manage. That's what the true war on drugs is all about.

1028
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:38,640
It's to keep other players out of the game. But anyway, my fellow chuckleheads as we get ready

1029
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:44,160
for the weekend and we feel a little bit full-barred and really my intent is not to bring you

1030
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:49,520
down. My intent is to expose and show you what's happening so that you can talk about this with

1031
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:55,520
friends. Let them know when we're all awake, no one can control us. We'll just be too big and too

1032
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:03,040
powerful with many, many, many citizens who are awake. World citizens and we all are children

1033
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:10,480
of the sun and the stars. Speaking of which, this October 14th, where

1034
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:20,400
extraterrestrials have been reported to surface a huge ship in the reports all vary between 20

1035
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:27,200
two days and three days. I'm getting that from a lot of pretty good channels that people really

1036
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:32,960
think that this is for real. I hate these type of predictions because if it doesn't

1037
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:38,960
happen, then it's, if it happens, okay, great. It's still going to be a huge fight to actually

1038
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:45,600
prove that what we're seeing is what was predicted and believe me, it will be counteracted by

1039
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:54,320
mainstream media. It really will be. And, you know, tinfoil hatwares will be laughed at and it'll

1040
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:59,200
be able to have all kinds of specialist and scientists coming out and telling us exactly what it is

1041
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:04,800
and what it isn't. But if it doesn't happen, then it's like 10 steps back, you know, then you

1042
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:11,280
then it's much harder. It just gets harder and harder. And I'm still very, very confused about all

1043
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:17,760
this attention that Larry King is spending on UFOs and the disclosure project and all these

1044
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:22,240
Air Force military personnel coming out and saying that they've seen him, that they've touched the

1045
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:28,480
space craft. They've some of flown in them and they have video and radar and it's all true.

1046
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:36,160
And I'm just so suspicious of why that's on Larry King. I may be, you know, maybe Larry King

1047
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:42,240
truly isn't a pen that I don't know. But I do have high hopes and I, you know, look, there's nothing

1048
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:49,520
to be lost by having a little bit of hope for that. It's a shortcut. It really is. It's a shortcut

1049
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:54,080
to where we want to go. But we still have to go through all the pain, the financial markets are

1050
01:37:54,080 --> 01:38:00,400
going to collapse. And the sooner we can wake up as many people as possible, the quicker we're going

1051
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:06,720
to be able to control what the reboot processes, what menu option we're going to choose, how do we

1052
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:11,840
want our world to look? Now, everything's coming crashing down. We have a very unique opportunity

1053
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:19,520
once in a more than a lifetime. And maybe 10 lifetime opportunity to actually change the way

1054
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:25,200
everything works. And that's going to be up to us. And that's not me. It's not you. It's all of us put

1055
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:31,040
together. So while it lives between your ears and you can clear your envisioned, please enjoy

1056
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:35,840
your freedom, my friends, and whatever you do this weekend, live your life with passion.

1057
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:45,840
Another fine, medial presentation. Stick it in your ear.
