5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:34,360
We're listening to a man I identified by the GSA as the spiritual leader of the subversive

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,360
cabal known by the code word, Pod Show.

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,360
A Dom Curry Delta Characters.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,360
Currently $7.00 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,360
To the next generation radio content in my ears.

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,360
We don't need nuss.

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,360
I like you to be a sign of your signature.

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,360
I'm guessing it's sad and correct.

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:28,360
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

14
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:58,360

15
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:28,360
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

16
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,120
Me now, when I meet now, when I'm down

17
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,360
When I meet you, when I meet you

18
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,360
When I meet you, that's what I meet now

19
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,360
When I meet you, when I meet you, I'm free for you here with me

20
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,360
I'm playing for something free, so I'll be there to make me see

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,360
My life feels so good to me

22
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,360
Last year, good to meet you

23
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
Wake up and sing in

24
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,360
When there we ended up, that's what I ain't нас

25
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
You wanna meet me now

26
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,360
When you should meet up, you wanna meet me now

27
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,360
You wanna meet me now, when I meet you, where you to meet me now

28
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,360
When you should meet, when I meet you, when I meet you

29
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,360
When you should meet, that's what I meet you

30
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,360
One of me now, one of my dreams for you will be with me

31
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,360
I'll play for you, set me free

32
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,360
So I think that you'll make me see

33
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,360
I'll try to get to you

34
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Once again, I'm a sucker for a real nice cookie pot too

35
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
And I'll knock

36
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,360
At the girl's stuff, they're from Switzerland

37
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
I think every single time they release a new track

38
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,360
I'm right there playing it

39
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Every single one is just walled to wall

40
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Hit me tearfully

41
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
Cheer me up

42
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,360
Kicking off episode number 710 of the Daily Source Code

43
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,360
For Thursday

44
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,360
There's early morning Thursday, January 17th, 2008

45
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,360
What the hell happened?

46
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,360
We're almost three quarters of the way through January

47
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
Righty

48
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Of course, I'm up here in the attic at the curry manner

49
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,360
And the affluent suburb of Surrey, known as Gilford, West Side of Gtown

50
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,360
Representing for you, sorry about yesterday

51
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Got a major league busy, even though I was home

52
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,360
Wait a minute, what was yesterday?

53
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
I don't even remember where I was

54
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
No, wait a minute

55
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Wednesday, I was in a crap, I don't know

56
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
I really don't know

57
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,360
I just don't remember

58
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,360
But we will get three shows in today

59
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,360
Proper footballer, Friday planned for tomorrow

60
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,360
And got a hit test, already lined up for that

61
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,360
Looks like Amy is sent in a new ass

62
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Sur size

63
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,360
So we'll keep all of that for tomorrow's festivities

64
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
And I'm not going into the city tomorrow

65
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Unlike today, that's why I'm up pretty early

66
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Getting the show done, I have a meeting with Hayhouse publishers

67
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
There of course the publishers

68
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,360
What is that?

69
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
I'm sorry

70
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
I thought it was on something weird

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,360
There are publishers of the books, many, many books

72
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
A couple of our stars on the network

73
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Originally from the UK

74
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
Gordon Smith, Spirit Messenger

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,360
Do you have not seen Spirit Messenger

76
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,360
You owe it to yourself to see this guy

77
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,360
He's the real deal when it comes to medium

78
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Spirit Messenger.podshow.com

79
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
I'm also a barefoot doctor

80
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,360
So you can find a barefoot doctor on podshow as well

81
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Then I've got a meeting with the readers

82
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,360
Digest and I've got a meeting with this guy

83
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
A new ash bee who was a huge

84
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
Record company boss back in the day

85
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,360
And he's trying to change the way music is promoted

86
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,360
And he's caught onto the pod save music revolution

87
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,360
So we'll be meeting with him

88
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
Who knows what he's got up his sleeve

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,360
Always just kind of interesting here people out

90
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,360
And there's a comment that came in a day or two ago

91
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,360
Which I'd have to say is one of the best comments

92
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
About pod safe music

93
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,360
In other words, music that independent producers

94
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Are allowed to use free of charge

95
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,360
Under license but free of charge in their programming

96
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,360
As long as they report it back to the artist or the label in question

97
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
And how it's really working and moving product

98
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Okay, it's moving product

99
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
This is what these guys aren't looking at

100
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Hello Mr. Hands over at EMI

101
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
You should be paying attention dude

102
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,360
Particularly to this comment from one of your customers

103
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Hello Adam

104
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Scott here from Scott podcast.com

105
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,360
I was listening to talking about the

106
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,360
The recording industry and how they're just sliding

107
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,360
Further and further back in the other day

108
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,360
A friend sent me a link to an article on the internet

109
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
I don't know if you saw or not

110
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,360
But it was about how the recording industry had brought a bunch of young people

111
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Into interview them to find out what makes them tick

112
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
And at the end of it

113
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,360
They offered them a bunch of current CDs of music

114
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,360
And they didn't take any

115
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
And they were obviously shocked

116
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
And what did that tell us?

117
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,360
That is awesome

118
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,360
You got to send a link to me for that story dude

119
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
That's funny

120
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,360
So they offered them free CDs in the alternative culture

121
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
Like oh my god

122
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
They don't even want to buy the CDs

123
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Now what do we do?

124
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
They want to take them for free

125
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,360
You know I guess that's because

126
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
MP3 is where it's at

127
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,360
That's what they did not

128
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
They want the digital music

129
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,360
And I think they're running scared from that

130
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,360
I read that they're going to have a cell phone

131
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,360
That they're offering and they're making a bundling deal on it

132
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,360
That's going to offer unlimited music

133
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,360
Of course you know that they're going to get a cut

134
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Of the sale of that cell phone

135
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Plus the sale probably of the service of that cell phone

136
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Which will probably be somewhat more expensive

137
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Than a non unlimited music cell phone would be

138
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
So nothing's really free

139
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Yeah you see I kind of disagree there

140
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,360
I think that that cartel is being broken open

141
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
Very very slowly

142
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
There will be new forms of

143
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Kind of cartels

144
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
But I saw a Christina

145
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,360
I watched or you know I gave her an iPod touch for Christmas

146
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,360
By the way she's already dropped a million times

147
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
Including once in the toilet

148
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
I don't know if the things dead are not

149
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
If it'll ever come back to life

150
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Teenagers

151
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
But I watched her fill it up

152
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,360
You know and she does not have an iTunes account

153
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,360
And she basically was filling it up with independent music

154
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
She wasn't going after anything

155
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,360
That's you know that's necessarily legally in license

156
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,360
Not that I could see at least

157
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Or I should say license

158
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Not license for the you know for downloading and putting it onto your iPod

159
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,360
You know she was downloading stuff off of my space players

160
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,360
And I believe she even looked at some

161
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,360
Some pod safe tunes and then search around to find those

162
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,360
I don't think she's purchased anything although she does have room bank card

163
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
So it's entirely possible

164
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
But I don't think she's pulled it out for that

165
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Yeah it's right you know

166
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
The kids want the MP3s

167
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
But not necessarily

168
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,360
And not a single I didn't see a RIP a single CD

169
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
By the way

170
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Which is another very interesting thing to me

171
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,360
So maybe the offering of these big companies just isn't that interesting anymore

172
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Gee you think

173
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
But that's where they're going

174
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,360
You know I got to thinking about this whole idea that it's going to become more and more difficult for them

175
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,360
To get in the middle of a business that's eliminating the middle man

176
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,360
Where bands can sell stuff directly to their customers

177
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,360
What does that say about movies?

178
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
Will there come a day when movies will be suffering the same fate?

179
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
I think probably so

180
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,360
You know I was watching the Steve Jobs keynote

181
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,360
Even though I'd followed along the live blogging on and gadget.com

182
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,360
And when he first of all Apple TV

183
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,360
I've got a boner over that

184
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
That Apple TV thing I think they might have gotten right

185
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
I don't know when it'll be available in the UK

186
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
But as soon as it is I'm buying one

187
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Because I have the perfect test audience for that

188
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,360
All I have to do is hook it up to our TV

189
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
And see if the lady Patricia uses it

190
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,360
And I'm going to set up you know I have a channel that I set up for her on her computer

191
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,360
With fashion shows and stuff

192
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Excuse me

193
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
The Frank true

194
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,360
You know a couple of things I know she wants to watch and listen

195
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
And once in a while she'll you know

196
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,360
By accident open up iTunes and so

197
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,360
So she'll see a little blue dot there and she'll play something

198
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,360
Anyway I think that it's all about ease

199
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
And I think people are perfectly willing to pay a couple dollars for something

200
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,360
If it's easy if it's just easy

201
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
That's what it is

202
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,360
It's just got to be easy so Apple moved

203
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,360
Took a significant step in that direction

204
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
But you are right I agree with the hypotheses

205
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
It's next

206
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,360
You know already we're seeing

207
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
Was it a

208
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,360
Vodafone just announced a new USB stick

209
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,360
Which will work on the HSDPCA LMNOP high super

210
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Transmorgified broadband network

211
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,360
It'll do 7.2 megabits on the download

212
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Not quite sure about the upload

213
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
But that's what it does in the download

214
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,360
And I have one of there a USB attachments for

215
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,360
For broadband it'll do it does about 1.3 megabits per second

216
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
And the connectivity was kind of busted

217
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
When I was prepping the show

218
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
And I didn't feel like waiting for it to

219
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
You know usually comes back in a minute or so

220
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
You know just happens

221
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
And so I plugged in the USB thingy

222
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,360
And I was off to the race as man

223
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,360
I was just like boom

224
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,360
I was I was downloading an amazing speeds

225
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,360
And it's just going to get better

226
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,360
You know there's just going to be more bandwidth

227
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,360
And it will be easier to transfer entire movie files

228
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
With or without bit torrent

229
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,360
You know you'll be able to just drag it into a Skype window

230
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
It'll just transfer fast

231
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,360
So yes this is of course what is next for the movie industry

232
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
And I guess I'll just quote

233
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,360
The Warner Music

234
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,360
I've got a brain freeze here

235
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,360
Doug Morris from Warner

236
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,360
In that recent wired interview we said look

237
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,360
If Coca Cola came out of the tap at your home

238
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Would you still go out and buy cans

239
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
And obviously obviously it's an answer

240
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Is of course no you wouldn't

241
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
And that's kind of what's happening

242
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Unless of course there was a different form of packaging

243
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,360
There's many many many opportunities

244
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Not just unexplored at this point in how to package music

245
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,360
So the only you know forms we have

246
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Basically are CD

247
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
And iTunes

248
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,360
You know that doesn't really show me that there's a lot of innovative thinking

249
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Going on there

250
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Of course there's lots of other places

251
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,360
The concept of a music store is kind of

252
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,360
You know the one packaging option and buying tracks

253
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Or buy multiple tracks

254
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
I mean there's a lot of different things you could do

255
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
And I still believe people like physical products

256
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
Unless there's some of the rush to the comment

257
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,360
And we're going to find that

258
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,360
The actors and writers and such

259
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
How are they going to monetize what they're doing

260
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,360
Directly to the people who they are

261
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
You know marketing their product to

262
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Because this is and you know it's quite so simple as the band

263
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Maybe it is I don't know there are fan fiction sites out there

264
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,360
They're doing some wonderful shows one of my favorites is a stock track show

265
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Maybe that's how they'll do it

266
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
I don't know how they'll monetize it

267
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
But it's going to be very interesting to watch this happen

268
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,360
And I just thought I'd mention that

269
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
In case you hadn't heard of it

270
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,360
If you want the link just say so

271
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
And I'll send that to you later on

272
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Take care and bye for now

273
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
Yeah man, thank you so much

274
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Great comment and send me the link

275
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
If you wouldn't mind also put it in the comments

276
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
For this show daily source code.com

277
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
In case I don't have enough time to put it

278
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
Into the show notes

279
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
You know me and time right

280
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
Excellent

281
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Okay, so great news

282
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
If you're follow curry.com

283
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
My weblog you probably saw

284
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
That the codes are in for the

285
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Nokia N8010

286
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,360
That the pod shown network is now authorized to sell

287
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
At a 15% discount

288
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
I've been telling you

289
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
We're going to do great with a great price

290
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
To the market and I have not found anything

291
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Yeah, I've seen people offer it for like

292
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
399 and then you click through

293
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
When it turns out you get like a

294
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
$30

295
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
discount if you

296
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Order a credit card

297
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
You know, so it will be $30 off your first purchase

298
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
If you use the credit card you have to order first

299
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
So there's a lot of shielding going on out there

300
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,360
But this 15% discount really is the best price

301
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
I've been able to find online

302
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
And here's the beauty part of it

303
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
If you're in the market for buying one of these

304
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Things anyway

305
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
Buy it from someone who show you

306
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
Listen to now we we started off with

307
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
The reasonably small group of people

308
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
Who are selling this with their promo codes

309
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Just like GoDaddy

310
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
It's the exact same

311
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
Sell our payment concept

312
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
But if you if you're listening to

313
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
I don't even

314
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
Don't even use my code

315
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
I've said that about GoDaddy

316
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
A million times as well if you listen to someone else

317
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
To show

318
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Then I hope those guys up because they get

319
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
A nice little piece of

320
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Of the pie

321
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
Of the purchase of that device

322
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
That you spend money on

323
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
So this is one way that we're helping

324
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
Shows with smaller yet

325
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Of course, extremely loyal audience is monetized

326
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
So

327
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
If you want this

328
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Internet tab, which as you know

329
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Completely nuts about it because it fills the void

330
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
For me at least between my

331
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,360
Cell phone, which also happens to be a Nokia

332
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
The E61I and my MacBook Pro

333
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,360
Because I want I absolutely need to have

334
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
An Ajax compatible Mozilla

335
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Based browser web 2.0 thingy

336
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
Because that's what makes the Internet work

337
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
These days and it's got it in there with the touch screen

338
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
It does Google Docs

339
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
It does Gmail in its full-blown glory

340
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
It's fast

341
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,360
It's stable, it's built on Linux, it's open source

342
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,360
You can run Skype natively right out of the box

343
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,360
A lot of things that I certainly really really need

344
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
And it's quite portable

345
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Yeah, I think there's a dent on mine

346
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
What is this?

347
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
I was just looking at it in the light

348
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
That's kind of weird

349
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Maybe there isn't a dent

350
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Maybe the light was falling on it

351
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Shit, I was kind of creepy

352
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
This is

353
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,360
I've started another site called

354
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
What the hell is it called?

355
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
I think it's called Nokia 800

356
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Screenshots.com

357
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
Let me just see

358
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Can you remember?

359
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,360
Of course, I purchased that using my GoDaddy code

360
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
DSC3

361
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Got it for under seven bucks

362
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
Let me see

363
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Where is it?

364
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Where's my screenshots?

365
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
I can't wait, let me see

366
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
I have a special

367
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Paves that I made here

368
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
Yeah, Nokia and 800

369
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
And that's n810

370
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Screenshots.com

371
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
And what I'm going to do is

372
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,360
Instead of boring you to death about how much I love the device

373
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,360
I'm going to give you a

374
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,360
Great application of this device

375
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,360
Each time I talk about it

376
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,360
And actually took a screenshot of this

377
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,360
Which is on the Nokia n800

378
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,360
Screenshots.com weblog

379
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Of this new service

380
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
It's not a new service

381
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
But it's a service I found

382
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Yesterday

383
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Called log me in

384
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
And so it's L-O-G-M-E-I-N

385
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Log me in.com

386
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
Now I love remote computing

387
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
I'm a big fan of V-N-C

388
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,360
I adore Apple's desktop sharing

389
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,360
But of course, setting all that stuff up

390
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Although on the Mac is relatively easy

391
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,360
Once you get down to a couple computers in the house

392
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,360
And you've got your router that has to be configured

393
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,360
And you've got a forward port

394
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,360
Who wants to deal with that shit

395
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,360
I guess kind of what Apple was doing

396
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,360
Back to my Mac, which just doesn't work

397
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Yeah, it works if you're on the same network in the house

398
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,360
But once you move outside your router

399
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,360
All kinds of crap starts to happen

400
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
And it just becomes incredibly difficult

401
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,360
So this log me in service, which works for Mac or PC

402
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,360
It enables you to do browser-based

403
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
Remote desktop viewing

404
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,360
So you can install this thing on any number of computers

405
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
It's free by the way

406
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,360
Of course they try to upsell you a

407
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,360
More functionality and more services

408
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,360
And then you can just take your n800

409
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,360
And you go to log me in.com

410
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,360
You log in. You see all of your computers right there

411
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
And a handy little list which ones are offline

412
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Which ones are online. You click on it

413
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,360
And it opens up and then you can start controlling

414
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,360
That computer from your tablet

415
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,360
It's all browser-based. It's unbelievable

416
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,360
And there's like four different ways to connect

417
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,360
You can use I think it does active X

418
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,360
Of course that will be for Windows machines

419
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,360
It has a Java version

420
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
It has a Mozilla-based version

421
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
Even HTML version

422
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,360
And you kind of got a full-around and see which one works best for you

423
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,360
Which circumstance depending also on your bandwidth

424
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,360
But it blew me away

425
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,360
And of course now I have this super-duper information

426
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Gadget in my hand which is really connecting to

427
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,360
To all the stuff going on on my desktop or any machine

428
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,360
How many times have you thought oh man

429
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,360
Well actually here's how I use it

430
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,360
So I've got the via which is pretty much become the studio machine

431
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,360
And it's hooked up to the mixer and everything

432
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,360
And a secondary monitor pretty much all the time

433
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,360
By the way you can switch between monitors or look at all monitors simultaneously

434
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,360
So whenever I'm sitting elsewhere not in the studio position

435
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,360
If I really want something to play over the speakers

436
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,360
It kind of has to run through the via

437
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
But that means I have to get up if I want to pause something

438
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Or change a track or if I want to preview something

439
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,360
And now right from my hand I can just click on the screen

440
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
And I make shit happen

441
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
You know as only right across the room

442
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
But of course I can do this from right across the globe

443
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
So check that out for sure

444
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
I'll put a link in the show notes to the screen shot

445
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Blogs you could take a look at that also

446
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Log me in dot com

447
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,360
Which is a fantastic service

448
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,360
I can't believe I had found that one yet

449
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Ah see what the N800 tended for me

450
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
So if you want to get this thing at a 15% discount

451
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
All the details are in the show notes

452
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Of course, but it's pretty simple

453
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,360
You go to nokiausa.com slash n810

454
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360

455
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,360
And you can buy any extra accessories

456
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,360
You want etc

457
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,360
This is for the USA only by the way

458
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,360
And you use the

459
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,360
What are they calling it?

460
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,360
They call it something different

461
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
On the UK site

462
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Let me just see

463
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,360
I think there they call it a promo code

464
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
No, hold on one of they call it

465
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Yeah, they call it the coupon code

466
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,360

467
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360

It's shit 21 minutes already

475
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
We got to move on

476
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,360

The love spirals

502
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
Run rather far

503
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,360
Me too evil

504
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
The sun can ship irony

You know, that's what I'm talking about man

515
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,360
That's packaging

516
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Now I'm presuming by the way

517
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,360
That you've cleared all of that with all the artists involved

518
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
I think I've seen email about that floating around

519
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
So I'm just going to presume that that's taking care of

520
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
So what a great idea

521
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,360
In fact, I'm talking with a couple of newspapers here in the UK

522
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
Remember when Princeton is album release

523
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
In the, what was it?

524
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
Was it the sundae mail I believe?

525
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
It was

526
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Yeah, I think it was the daily mail on sundae

527
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,360
Or something like that

528
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
They're starving for this type of product

529
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,360
So to be able to get this type of distribution

530
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,360
In these innovative new packaging ways

531
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
Is fantastic

532
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
So yeah, do do

533
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
To send me more information on that just email

534
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,360
Or send to another comment

535
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
I'd love to know how you cleared that

536
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
How the mechanics of it work

537
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
I mean that's

538
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
We really can do this people

539
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,360
And record companies who have

540
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Shit loads of people and money

541
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
They could be doing so much

542
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
More

543
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
It's so much smarter

544
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,360
If they just change their thinking a little bit

545
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
They're going to fire 2,000 people at EMI

546
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,360
You know, you could probably fire 4,000 people

547
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
Sorry about those people, but I'm just saying

548
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,360
If you just worked a little bit smarter

549
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Quick run down of the news

550
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
Briefly just some stuff that's going on

551
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
That caught my eye

552
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
Kind of a krefuffle going on

553
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
Between

554
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
NATO

555
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,360
Or some of the NATO armed forces

556
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
And

557
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Why the hell didn't this open up

558
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Hold on a second

559
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
And

560
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,360
The US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates

561
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
This is interesting

562
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,360
He was quoted

563
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,360
In the Los Angeles Times

564
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
By the way, I'll get to the second

565
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
He was quoted saying

566
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
That

567
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
I'm worried we're deploying

568
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,360
Military advisors that are not properly trained

569
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,360
We're worried we have some military forces that don't know how to do counter insurgency operations

570
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,360
And this was about

571
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,360
Basically the only other three countries that are participating

572
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
Britain

573
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
The Netherlands

574
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
And what's the last country

575
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
I mean, there's only a couple countries out there

576
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
And the Dutch

577
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Freaked out

578
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
Particularly because they just lost two of their brave soldiers

579
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
Do defundly fire

580
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
In Afghanistan

581
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
And

582
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
So now Gates is saying

583
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Oh, I was misquoted

584
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,360
I didn't mean it that way

585
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,360
Pull shit

586
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,360
I call him big bullshit out

587
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
Of course you said that

588
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
And of course, they were

589
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
Lured into Afghanistan for rebuilding initiatives

590
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,360
Not to be fighting the Taliban as is happening right now

591
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,360
And what the hell are we doing there any

592
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
What exactly is going on in Afghanistan

593
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
As far as I can tell

594
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
All we're doing is making sure that the

595
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Films don't get burned down so that the drug trade can continue because of course

596
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
That's what Wall Street actually runs on

597
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
Is all of this drug money flowing through the economy

598
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Speaking of

599
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360
Wall Street

600
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,360
Here's one for you

601
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,360
City group

602
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,360
Posted a fourth quarter net loss of

603
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
17.4 billion

604
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
Dollars

605
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,360
And they have immediately and this is here we go

606
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,360
This is the wholesale of Wall Street ladies and gentlemen

607
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
I'm not going to say America because Wall Street kind of lives in its own

608
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,360
And its own world

609
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
Every single time they make a profit

610
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
I think the little guy loses that money and gets screwed

611
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
I can't quite

612
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,360
Calculated all the way back but it feels that way to me

613
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
They are they've taken out a loan

614
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
Well, not really alone. They're selling

615
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,360
Preferred stock for 14.5 billion

616
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
Dollars basically they're raising money because

617
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
They're they would go under

618
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,360
And who are they raising it from?

619
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,360
Ah, well, let me tell you

620
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,360
They're raising it from foreign investors

621
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,360
The Korea Investment Group

622
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,360
Who, by the way, are investing

623
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,360
6.6 billion

624
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,360
Dollars in Merrill Lynch

625
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
There's a couple of Middle Eastern groups

626
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
These sovereign wealth funds

627
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,360
You've heard me talk about

628
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,360
So basically the tables the way I see it are now being turned

629
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,360
Where's the United States used to hand out money hand over foot

630
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,360
To foreign countries for infrastructure

631
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,360
Which of course went straight back into the coffers

632
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,360
Of the military industrial complex

633
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,360
And and oil companies and energy companies to build infrastructure

634
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,360
And rail and the telecommunications etc

635
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Now it looks like it's the other way around

636
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,360
Now Wall Street is about to become enslaved

637
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,360
By China, by Asia in general, by the Middle East

638
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,360
By the sovereign wealth funds

639
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
When you default on one of those payments

640
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
What do you think is going to happen, dude?

641
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,360
Very very interesting

642
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,360
I'm sure we have a financial savant

643
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
Out there somewhere who can shed some light on it

644
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
Hey, where is uh

645
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,360
Where's the nylon

646
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
In all this isn't in that racket

647
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
We haven't heard from him for a while

648
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
Hmm

649
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
I wonder if perhaps that's because

650
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
Of the credit crunch

651
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
Maybe he lost his job

652
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
Hopefully he'll check in soon

653
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,360
And uh

654
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,360
Lots of talk over here in the UK

655
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
Energy prices are soaring

656
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
I'm talking about

657
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
60 pounds

658
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,360
Increase per household normal household

659
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
Not talking about this this huge

660
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,360
Box of

661
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
Energy slurping

662
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Gadgetry that is known as the curry manner

663
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
Normal house

664
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
120 bucks extra a year

665
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,360
Because of so called green obligations

666
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,360
Or the geo

667
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
As they're now abbreviating it in the press

668
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,360
So because of a reduction in carbon emissions etc

669
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,360
Your bill is going up significantly

670
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,360
Ah, sounds a little bit like bullshit here there

671
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,360
But who knows?

672
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,360
I'm sure the energy companies can you know British gas of course can explain it

673
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,360
But it has

674
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,360
Resparked the debate about nuclear in the UK

675
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,360
And I sent a call out to atomic rod

676
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
Our atomic energy savant

677
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
If he could shed some light on what's going on

678
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
With the UK and nuclear power

679
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,360
Because it sounds to me like they are going to approve new plans to come online

680
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
Which of course I said the other day will take until 2020

681
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,360
But it is an interesting turn

682
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,360
And of course

683
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
For the debate

684
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
It is clean energy

685
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
There is an issue with the nuclear waste

686
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,360
And of course there is still lingering which I believe

687
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
Are incorrect questions about the safety of nuclear

688
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,360
I think I think that comparing a Chernobyl

689
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,360
Like reactor to the types of reactors that are being built today

690
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,360
Is pretty much black and white night and day

691
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
Hot and cold

692
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,360
But let's let the truce savant talk about it

693
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,360
Adam, it's atomic rod atmosphere

694
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,360
Your energy savant

695
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
Looking through some articles on BBC this morning

696
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,360
Notice that at 1130

697
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,360
Greenwich meantime

698
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,360
John Hutton

699
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,360
The UK business secretary is scheduled to make an announcement

700
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,360
To the House of Commons

701
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
That the UK government has decided that

702
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,360
New nuclear power stations might be just the

703
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,360
Answer to high prices of oil and gas

704
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,360
Just wondered if this announcement

705
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,360
Is making any play on television

706
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,360
Since nothing happens

707
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,360
Unless it's on television

708
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
Love you Adam

709
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
Bye

710
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,360
Yeah man, love you

711
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,360
No homo

712
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,360
Okay, that didn't really answer the question rod

713
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
But I know you're listening

714
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
So I'm sure it get back to me on that

715
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,360
Yeah, it's getting play

716
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,360
Of course it gets played on the news

717
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
It gets a lot of play on the talk radio

718
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Mainly BBC 4

719
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,360
Radio 4

720
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,360
Something just hit me

721
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,360
I started interrupt this flow

722
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,360
About atomic energy

723
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,360
But I was asked specifically

724
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,360
By the producer of the Chris Moile Show

725
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,360
To send her an email

726
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,360
Detailing why I think I should be on the show

727
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,360
On Chris Moile's show

728
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,360
And set him straight

729
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
And also just to

730
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
Make nice make friends

731
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,360
Because I got nothing against the guy

732
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,360
But he's basically propagating

733
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
Disinformation and misinformation

734
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,360
About him I'd like to compare notes

735
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,360
So you know my agent

736
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,360
Super agent Keith called over to the show

737
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,360
And spoke with this

738
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,360
Woman what's her name

739
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
Rachel something or other

740
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
Hold on

741
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Rachel Rachel Rachel

742
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
What's her last name

743
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
Let me just check Rachel Jones or something

744
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
Anyway, well that's loading up

745
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,360
So I sent her a real nice email

746
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,360
She hasn't even replied back

747
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
You know

748
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,360
Okay if you just want to

749
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
If you don't want to do anything or whatever

750
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,360
But just you know how the courtesy

751
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,360
At least call me back

752
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
Rachel Jones is her name

753
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
That's really quite

754
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
Quite rude

755
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,360
Okay back to the energy stuff

756
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,360
Actually, no let me stick with Moiles for a second

757
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
Nah fuck it

758
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
I was gonna say something nasty

759
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
I'm not gonna know

760
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
Uhh

761
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,360
I would ever

762
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,880
Atomic Rod send in some worrying foe. Let me know what we're gonna do here

763
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:46,240
Okay, because clearly this is gonna crunch a lot of people if they have to spend that much extra money a year just on

764
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,520
On energy and I'm sure

765
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,520
Wow, man, what a spiral

766
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,360
Hey, there's a lot more going on in the in the UK and in the EU as well

767
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,640
We have a correspondence of on for that. His name is

768
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,360
Comic strip

769
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Comic strip

770
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
Comic strip

771
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
Comic strip

772
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:16,720
Hiya, Adam Flericary. Here is CSB your EU correspondent

773
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:24,400
So European food safety authority agency has just the 30 minutes that food made of clowns

774
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,560
Of clowns animas is not clowns

775
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,800
Okay, it's clones just so you understand it

776
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,720
Yes, clones of clowns animas is healthy for consumption

777
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,920
Yes, eating clowns is healthy

778
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,920
Yummy

779
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:49,520
But still genetically ordered food is not kosher, so you know watch

780
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:58,800
I think unlike in USA where biodes are is subsidized very heavily in EU biofuel or biodiesel is text not

781
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:06,320
Not subsidized and market segmented and generally by of your biodiesel industry in in EU

782
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,440
Dies out in the Europe and in EU and moves to USA

783
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
So you

784
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,120
Yeah, I caught that article too that

785
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:25,120
That the yeah, I guess it's the EU health administration is said hey, you know eating cloned animals is healthy

786
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:31,680
How do they know that they really know the long-term's effective that it's not

787
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,120
Are we living in a science fiction movie or what it's freaking me out a little bit

788
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,960
All right, I got to get into the city. I'm getting emails now people saying

789
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,960
We're gonna add this meeting subtract that meeting lots of stuff going on

790
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,560
Glad you stuck with me for today. I thought it was gonna be a little shorter than that we're still around our 40 minutes

791
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,160
By the way, the weather today completely crap in the UK the rain is coming down sideways once again

792
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,040
I'll play another song from the pod safe music now

793
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,640
Something I picked up that I really dig the steering can't hear me on the

794
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,560
Right there

795
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
So

796
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,560
Can you feel this?

797
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,560
I'm dying for my chance to live till I let go

798
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,560
Let it go, I can't allow

799
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,560
The melody is where you're

800
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,560
Can you give me?

801
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,560
You wasted all this time to fit the balance

802
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,560
You couldn't be yourself in their eyes

803
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Maybe it's easier to be there

804
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,560
And it all will be alright

805
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,560
But think it's all the way you live your life

806
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,560
You wasted all this time to fit the balance

807
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,560
You wasted all this time

808
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,560
In the middle of the clouds you're flying out

809
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,560
Can you hear me?

810
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,560
I'm fighting for my right to break

811
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,560
Can you feel this?

812
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,560
I'm dying for my chance to live till I let go

813
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,560
Let it go, I can't allow

814
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,560
The melody is where you're

815
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Can you give me before the day ends

816
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,560
Before the sunset between the breeze

817
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,560
And hope will come back

818
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:34,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

819
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,560
Think you're welcome

820
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:44,560
Can you hear me?

821
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,560
Can you feel this?

822
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,560
Can you hear me?

823
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,560
I'm fighting for my right to break

824
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Can you feel this?

825
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,560
I'm dying for my chance to live till I let go

826
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,560
Let it go, I can't allow

827
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,560
The melody is where you're

828
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Can you hear me?

829
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,560
I've been on the network for a while

830
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,560
They're from Australia, kick ass man

831
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
I love that song

832
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,560
Actually they've now based themselves in Brighton

833
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,560
In the UK, interesting

834
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,560
I flew past Brighton the other day

835
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,560
When I did my little wrecky along the south coast

836
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,560
I saw this before I ended up for today

837
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,560
I saw this program

838
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,560
On the

839
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,560
I think it was a channel four

840
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,560
I believe called the Sandbanks

841
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
Pierce Morgan goes to the Sandbanks

842
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,560
And I'd never heard of this place before

843
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,560
It's right underneath kind of like west of Barnmouth

844
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,560
Which you may not know has the warm Gulf stream come

845
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,560
Hits that particular part of the south coast

846
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,560
They even have palm trees in Barnmouth

847
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,560
It's really they have a nice weather there

848
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
Or nicer weather than the rest of the country

849
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,560
And this place is like they call the monoco of the UK

850
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
And I'm looking at that and I'm like, oh man

851
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,560
It's just amazing what's happening there

852
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,560
So a new destination has been found

853
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,560
That I've been studying up on Barnmouth Airport

854
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,560
Which also has big aircraft coming in

855
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,560
So I got a kind of concentrate before I go there

856
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,560
And the lady P is willing to so who knows

857
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
Maybe this weekend if the weather clears up a little bit

858
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,560
Because next week I'll probably be off the San Francisco

859
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,560
I think we've got a board of directors meeting

860
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,560
And some other stuff so

861
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,560
And tomorrow I will be here to bring you a proper

862
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Fubar Friday

863
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,560
I'm stacked up, still could use some musical suggestions

864
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,560
But lots of good stuff ready for you

865
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Including the hit test and an exercise for me

866
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
So what more could you want?

867
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,560
Until then my friends

868
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,560
Live your life with passion and enjoy your freedom

869
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,560
Another pod show podcast

870
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,560
Stick it in your ear

871
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,560
Thanks for watching
