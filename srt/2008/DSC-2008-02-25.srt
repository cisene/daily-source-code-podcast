Delta Shara Charley, 7-2-Niner.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane scrapped to my ass.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm guessing it's a matter of curry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I never thought I'd miss you.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Half as much as I do.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I never thought I'd feel this way.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The way I feel about you.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Soon as I wake up, every night, every day.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I know that it's easy to write me.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You take my blood to white.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It must be love, love, love.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It must be love, love, love.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Nothing won, nothing won.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Nothing won, nothing won.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How can it be that weekend?

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Say so much without words.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It must be love, love, love.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It must be love, love.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It must be love, love.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It must be love, love.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It must be love, love.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It must be love, love.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It must be love, love.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It must be love, love.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It must be love, love.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It must be love, love.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It must be love, love.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It must be love, love.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It must be love, love, love.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It must be love, love, love.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Nothing won, nothing won, nothing won.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:03:02,000
As soon as I wake up, every night, every day

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have the tissue I need to take the lens away

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It must be the love love

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It must be love love love

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It must be love love

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It must be love love

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's another one of those tracks, probably presented by the organization for the preservation of the soundtrack of our lives

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It must be love

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Brought to you actually by Chief Gadget Guru Andrew Grummit who sent that one to me and he said he grew up on that song

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So I figured I might as well spin it for you

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's a daily source code episode number 729 coming to you from the curry condo in Northern California

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Current time 837 in the evening San Francisco time of course

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh man, my back hurts

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's been a very very long day started way early this morning

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You know, we have these conference calls on what does it choose what to say?

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Mondays and Thursdays when we all the sales we still get together

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And we chat but they have to start at 7 o'clock in the morning

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And I'm not good without having my morning tea of course

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Which has to be just perfectly made and I need to have a little bit of toast a little bit of breakfast

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And I don't know it's just been a long long day

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But it's still good being here even though I missed the girls back home

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And plenty to talk about today the first thing actually I spent a lot of time yesterday

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I can't remember what inspired it exactly but I'm really happy I got into it

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I decided that I would take a look at Safari as it browser once again

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Most of you probably know that I'm back on back on the Mac

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And loving it very very much

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But I was really getting tired of Firefox

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You know it was hogging system resources

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Taking a long time to you know to render pages sometimes

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's just I don't know it was I was getting a little little fed up with it

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And said you know why don't I give Safari another try

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Boy am I glad I did that

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Man that thing is so blazingly fast compared to Firefox

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And I started to do some calculations

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Actually this is something that that I did with our previous company

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Think new ideas which we had in the mid 90s up until 2000

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We discovered that it would actually be cheaper

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
These are the days before video we were doing lots of website stuff

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And actually lots and lots of rendering was being done by you know Photoshop rendering

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And you know stuff like that and of course the power of the machines was much more

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I would say it was always eight I think in those days for the Mac always eight always nine

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And we discovered that it would be cheaper to buy honking fast super machines for our designers

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Because the amount of time they spent waiting for crap to render was really a huge huge cost to us

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And so I started to think about this I believe that on a daily basis

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You know the difference between Firefox rendering and Safari could actually save me up to an hour

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And think about it you know yeah it's just seconds

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But seconds before you know it turned into minutes and minutes before you know it turned into hours

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And well it makes a big difference something else I found by the way

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Of course you know with Safari there's all with any new browser any new piece of software

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There's all kinds of little nuances and things that do work and don't work and work a little differently

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And you have to get used to it now I'm not a guy who has a shitload of extensions loaded into Firefox

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So I really don't mind I just need a browser that goes fast and that I can manipulate with a keyboard because I'm a big keyboard guy

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And you know the less I use the mouse again another time saver right

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I discovered that you know sometimes it would kind of hang or do some weird stuff and I get these pub sub errors

93
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And well of course I have not used Safari on this machine at all

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
However it comes standard with a whole bunch of RSS feeds that are baked in

95
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And these RSS feeds are checked I guess by default once an hour or once every half hour

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And what Safari is doing and remember this is out of the box that didn't configure any of this is it's aggregating you know news feeds

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And it's storing these in some magical place on on your hard drive

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Now again how long have I had this machine couple months it had a mast almost 30 gigs 30 gigabytes worth of disk space

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
With I guess sites that it's downloaded I have no idea how it got to that point

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But you know it was hanging at one point and I just had to screw it. I'm going to clear out this RSS feed database

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm going to turn it all off which you luckily can do and I'm going to empty out all these all these sites or these feeds or whatever the

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Caches that it that it has

103
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Thirty gigabytes all of a sudden reappeared on my drive and like okay, this is good news

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So I'm really enjoying it the speed is astronomical and probably

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
When I get back to to the manner, I'm going to do a little ab testing and really see how much time it to how much time it says

106
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But I'm pretty sure it's it's quite an astronomical amount

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Today by the way we're doing another live version of the Charlie we've got plenty of chuckle heads who are logged in everybody waves say hi

108
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They're all on the conference call and I will be coming to them later on because there's one big topic that I want to talk about

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm promoting it throughout the day. I post it on my weblog and I sense some Twitter is out about it

110
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So hopefully people will get into it and well and we'll be able to talk about some stuff

111
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hi Adam this is Cameron and I'm calling from New Zealand

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What a wonderful show DSC 728 was I really enjoyed it and I loved it

113
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And I just wanted to say thank you very much and all of your shows are fantastic and I do enjoy listening to them

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm sure when you were recording that session you must have had Patricia on your mind quite a lot

115
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And for me it also made me think of my wife. She's been overseas for several months

116
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And I look forward to seeing you shortly

117
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Right Adam, but thanks Adam

118
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And I think that's enough of me kissing your ass

119
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh never know one more time come on baby

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Pack her up Adam

121
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Here we go

122
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh

123
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Thanks mate

124
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Well that you know what I'm so happy to hear that because then it hit home, you know you do a show like that which is under the auspices of the organization for the preservation of the soundtrack of our lives

125
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But you're known as upsall you can find the show for upsall at upsall.podshow.com

126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oscar Papa Sierra Oscar Lima

127
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And if I evoke some kind of emotion just like me, you know your thousands of miles away from your better half

128
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Clearly your better half and my better half and you get that soundtrack to your life and it just makes you feel kind of good doesn't it

129
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So I'm really happy you liked it

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You'll last night which was Sunday night, of course, it's what is it now in Australia?

131
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Friday

132
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The Academy Awards were on and I was actually pretty much prepared to watch

133
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I spent you know because we're on the west coast and I think that show kicks off at 6 p.m.

134
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Pacific Standard Time

135
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And I watched I was flipping back and forth between the e-channel you know basically the red carpet and TV guide channel also was on the red carpet

136
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And even ABC had some people on the red carpet and I'm thinking of myself

137
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
These guys have kind of jumped the shark on this whole deal

138
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You know it's all about what you're wearing

139
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Who designed your dress you know there's no more mystique to it

140
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I can't quite put my finger on it but I know it's wrong

141
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I really do I can just feel it you know it's like it's been over

142
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Some things been over commercialized

143
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It just doesn't have that mystique anymore and I was you know all prepared to

144
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Kickback relax and watch the show last night and then we decided that Ron and I decided that you know we could do some work

145
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And I went over to his house and the fur of Chris Mac came over and we were working on some stuff

146
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So I didn't actually watch the show and it turns out I was not alone

147
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The ratings the overnight ratings came out

148
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And I'm reading this from

149
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Where did I get this from CNN dot com actually but New York time a whole bunch of publications

150
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Posted this news

151
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
In fact the headline here is Oscars are ratings dud

152
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Newerson media research says preliminary ratings for the 80th annual Academy Awards telecaster

153
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We're 14% lower than the least watched ceremony ever

154
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The overnight ratings 21% lower than last year

155
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That is that is proof. Well, you know what is proof of because once again on the red carpet

156
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You hear all this hype and shit and

157
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's like the Academy Awards will be watched by billions

158
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
A billion people worldwide a billion

159
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That's billion with a B I'm like fuck this bullshit

160
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We know it's bullshit

161
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I mean those are the days when you could still scam people into thinking that you know it's like

162
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Well, we're going out via satellite and it's just not true

163
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So again, I didn't see the show so I have no idea if it was any good

164
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But I even Patricia didn't watch it

165
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Of course it was it was on late at night

166
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
She did watch the red carpet she said yeah, I'm bored with it all

167
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You know, where's the where's the glamour or where's the mystique?

168
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Where's the the glitz that we're that we love to see from Hollywood and by the way

169
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So that I don't know any of these movies

170
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It seems like all really you know complicated difficult

171
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
People

172
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I should really you know, I can't wait to do a show with Patricia. Oh, man

173
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I mean so cold to do that with her again

174
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Man, oh man, oh man

175
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So I would have to say that it definitely feels like there was a little bit of a shark jumping going on there

176
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And the ratings definitely prove it

177
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Let's see we got the candy man hanging on the line candy man what you got for me brother

178
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Hi Adam it's me again

179
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah, I really like what you are doing with this live shows

180
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I think it could be a very interesting way to discuss certain topics

181
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Definitely much easier to discuss in a live situation

182
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And by sending voice feedback back and forth

183
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Example is this my cranky geeks comment I mean it would be much easier to discuss my feedback

184
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Let's say yeah one on one with you or with anybody else for that matter

185
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But I'm just surprised that a lot of people seem to be dialing in

186
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But then they don't provide any inputs so they don't participate in the live call

187
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Or they they just seem to be hanging there listening

188
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So I wonder what's the what's the reason is there's a technical reason

189
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Or are people just I mean why do people dial in if if they don't if they are not ready to participate in the in the discussion

190
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm just wondering what's going on there

191
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I mean definitely if the times or not timing would be better for me

192
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I would and I would have time to dial in I would definitely dial in and try to participate in this discussion to make this live

193
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Part of your show a little bit more interesting

194
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So it's yeah, that's just something I'm wondering about perhaps you have some insight into that thanks

195
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Bye.

196
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Of course I have some insight into that

197
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's really quite simple. First of all the timing is all off being here on the west coast

198
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Benefit I get from being in the United Kingdom is you know I can do the show and it's morning for everybody and in fact I love getting the show out

199
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You know around one or two PM

200
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So one or two in the afternoon the UK which is a morning time for the for the east coast and of course folks on the west coast

201
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Definitely have the show by the time they get up and

202
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Well, unfortunately again, you know I guess people in Hawaii they're on yesterday's time

203
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And also you know it's it's a matter of having a moderator or giving people a topic and we'll see we'll see how it goes later on tonight

204
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It'll be curious

205
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And

206
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Absolutely there's the proof for you. I knew we were all being a little bit too politically correct

207
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I appreciate that calm and really do that makes a lot of sense

208
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Let me see how to couple thing. Oh by the way, of course now that I'm using Safari the one thing that I actually did use Firefox for which doesn't is not compatible in Safari

209
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
is

210
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Google's notebook

211
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And I was thinking yeah, I really need a way to

212
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You know to organize myself and I was kind of using the notebook because it works on all different computers

213
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But honestly I'm back to really one single device one computer

214
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I do everything on at the entire show is created on and now

215
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And I went back to an omni outline or if you ever seen this

216
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Actually I was using this back in the days of the curry cottage

217
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So that's what three years ago almost two or three years ago and

218
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The program is a little bit more stable than it used to be. It's still a great outline

219
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I spent some time yesterday and last night learning how to use it again

220
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Because again I'm a keyboard guy. I love using the keyboard to navigate through everything

221
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And

222
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I might even you know there's a they have a great function you can export it

223
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Gosh, and it's all coming back to me. I used to export as OPML files

224
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And anyway, there's a

225
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
There's an export function you can export as dynamic HTML so it actually will export as an outline

226
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And now I'm even storing the voice males and the promos and the feedback and all that stuff in there

227
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's pretty good. You should give it a give it a shot

228
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And of course link links to everything that we discussed on today's show including

229
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Omni Outliner will be in the show notes a daily source code dot com

230
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm single girl in the city here to tell you about my new show getting single

231
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
My happily ever after story book romance kind of very unfairy town like ending

232
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm 26. I found myself surrounded with friends who are happily getting engaged

233
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Getting married getting pregnant and there I was getting a single

234
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You can hear my not so Hollywood love story and all its great details at getting single dot

235
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Potcho dot com

236
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I know they're awesome show to check out on pod show

237
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And something else you might want to check out if you haven't seen it yet

238
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Have you seen this gene sim in sex tape?

239
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Man, that guy's ugly

240
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't know much about history

241
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Don't know much about biology

242
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Don't know much about science

243
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Don't know much about the franchise

244
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But I do know that I love you

245
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And I know that if you love it too

246
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Well I wanna pull around this for me

247
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Don't know much about geography

248
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Don't know much about history

249
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Don't know much about how to grow

250
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Don't know what a sky blue is for

251
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But I do know what it's for

252
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And if this world could be with you

253
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Well I wonder for where this for me

254
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Now I don't claim to be at a student

255
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But I'm trying to be

256
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
For maybe about being at a student baby

257
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I can win, don't know what you're about

258
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
History

259
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Don't know much about biology

260
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Don't know much about science for

261
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But I do know that I love you

262
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And I know that if you love it too

263
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Well I wonder for where this for me

264
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk

265
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
History

266
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Wow, the G

267
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Well, let's talk, let's talk, let's talk

268
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Let's talk

269
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah, but I do know that I love you

270
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Sing along

271
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And I know that if you love it too

272
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Well I wonder for where this for me

273
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm in service

274
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't know much about history

275
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What I wonder for a world this would be

276
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So of course I just checked in the chat room

277
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
While the song was playing

278
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And no one from the UK on and no one

279
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Thinking about talking too much

280
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's okay because I got plenty of stuff here

281
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Cute up

282
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
We're gonna move over to the United Kingdom

283
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And talk about a couple things

284
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The first one is about the nationalization of Northern Rock

285
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
The Bank that was on the verge of going bankrupt

286
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Of course due to the credit crisis

287
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Which is turned into a global financial fiasco

288
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Way beyond the subprime mortgages

289
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The central problem is that banks just don't trust

290
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Each other anymore

291
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And so when there's no trust

292
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
There's no money being traded

293
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
There's no liquidity and it's a big ass problem

294
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Now of course we have a financial sabon

295
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
To talk about the nationalization of this bank

296
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And I got him right here for you

297
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Adam, it's been smoking one of your recently pointed economics

298
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Want to give you could go on just to the whole Northern Rock

299
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And pretend nationalizing it

300
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's to that idea

301
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Nationalizing a bank probably never

302
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
A good idea

303
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
However

304
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Probably what they had to do

305
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Given the situation because letting a bank fail

306
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Is even worse

307
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm a capitalist at heart

308
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And kind of feel that businesses are there to make people money

309
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And if businesses want to take risks to make money

310
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They should do that

311
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And if they fail at those risks they should go to business

312
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So there's programming that says this bank should have just gone out of business

313
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But the bank's failing has pretty wide reaching repercussions

314
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Not just to the people that own the bank

315
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And not to the people whose money is deposited in the bank

316
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'll just stop for one second there

317
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I do believe that these banks are insured

318
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So of course it has repercussions of the bank fails

319
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Then the insurance that the government provides for all banks

320
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Or all certified banks

321
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I guess or sanction banks

322
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
That is going to be a big nut

323
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So I totally agree that that's a big problem

324
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
But I think it has more to do with the psyche

325
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But you're probably going to get to that

326
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
As I think we were talking about earlier

327
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
When some of your conspiracy theories

328
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And the whole making money out of thin air

329
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Playbaria

330
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
One of the things we saw is that banks lend money out

331
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And they lend out more money than they have on deposit

332
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So it's people make a run on the bank and take out all their money

333
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's tough to give them that because most of the money

334
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's not all from it is all lend out

335
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So so many of the kind of step in and stop that

336
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
From having to kind of prop up the confidence

337
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
With in the bank so that people don't make a run

338
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And if one bank fails and people start worrying about other banks

339
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
They make a run on other banks

340
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And the whole system kind of collapses in on itself

341
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So the nationalizing it

342
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Probably in the normal situations

343
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Necrash it happen

344
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But given the situation hopefully it works out

345
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But then that's pretty much my two cents

346
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So have a great day

347
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And keep up the good shows

348
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Thank you very much

349
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Well

350
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
One other thing that there's been a topic on the Charlie is about

351
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
The refusal of the bank or there was a paragraph in the documents for the nationalization

352
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
That the bank would not be subject to a freedom of information act request

353
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And which of course is makes no sense

354
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It absolutely should be wide open

355
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Actually I got a comment about that

356
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Let me see where is this

357
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
That's too long

358
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I don't even go into that

359
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
However

360
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
A lot of people emailed me and said well you know would you want

361
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
People to be able to request information about your mortgage

362
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'll tell you people of the United Kingdom who emailed me that

363
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
If you're comfortable with your privacy being violated by

364
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Millions of closed circuit TV cameras

365
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Strong up all over the United Kingdom

366
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And of course lots of people say I have nothing to hide

367
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm doing nothing wrong

368
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Why would you ever problem with the people looking into your private information?

369
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Is that interesting?

370
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Where lots of people will say

371
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah, it's okay these cameras

372
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm not doing anything wrong

373
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
But yet when it comes to other things

374
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And of course a mortgage you're not doing anything wrong with the mortgage

375
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm sure you're not

376
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yet people don't really want anyone looking at that stuff

377
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I just find that interesting

378
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
If you live in the United Kingdom

379
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Here's what you will be hearing on the radio

380
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I believe it starts this week

381
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You'll be hearing on the radio

382
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I believe there's also going to be television commercials

383
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And also print campaigns again

384
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
If you haven't seen this go to curried.com

385
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I posted about it quite extensively

386
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Fellow Chuckle had Paul Parkinson parkey

387
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
sent me actually he notified me of this

388
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
He sent me a comment which I'll play in a second

389
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But first let's listen to the radio commercials

390
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Which will be playing

391
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Starting this week in the United Kingdom

392
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
How to tell the difference between

393
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
How much is videoing a crowded place

394
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And someone who's checking it out for a terrorist attack

395
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
How can you tell if someone's buying unusual quantities of stuff

396
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
For a good reason or if they're planning to make a bomb

397
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
What's the difference between someone just hanging around

398
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And someone behaving suspiciously

399
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
How can you tell if they're a normal everyday person or a terrorist

400
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
The answer is you don't have to

401
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
If you call the confidential anti terrorist type line on

402
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
0800 789 321

403
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
The specialist officers you speak to

404
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Analyze the information

405
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
They'll decide if and how to follow it up

406
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You don't have to be sure if you suspect it

407
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Report it call the anti terrorist hotline

408
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
0800 789 321 in confidence

409
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So that to me is is pretty darn scary

410
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Our Nate is on and as raise his hand

411
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Want to say something Nate go ahead you're on the Charlie

412
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Hey, so I'm gonna put up cameras

413
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
That's fine by me. Just put a camera's net office

414
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
What I can watch didn't do what they're doing to

415
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah, I'm not quite sure I understand what do you mean

416
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Who watches the watches

417
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Are you a second or suddenly violate my privacy

418
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I expect the exact same privilege against them

419
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I want to be able to tune to their website

420
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And watch what they're doing whenever I want

421
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
That's a good point

422
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You would need some kind of oversight

423
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I guess I have no idea how it's done other than what I understand

424
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Is that it's pretty low level people

425
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
It's pretty low level people who are watching this stuff

426
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And when you think about it, you got millions of cameras

427
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You know, you can't have

428
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Super sleuths manning every single one of them

429
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So I'm not quite sure how we would go ahead

430
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I mean, I mean, like parliament or the center of the house

431
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I want a camera in each one of their offices

432
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Ah, well, of course the good thing about the UK

433
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And I have to say I really enjoy as they do have

434
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You know, you can pretty much tune into what's going in

435
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
In the House of Commons at any moment

436
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
They do put that on television

437
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And in the states here we have C-SPAN as well

438
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
But you actually want to go into the offices

439
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Well, you know, that kind of transparency

440
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I don't think we're ever going to see that

441
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Honestly

442
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But your point is well, I

443
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
What's that

444
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
As an I would an exact public camera

445
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Okay, yeah, where do you love Nate?

446
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I have a day

447
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Where do you love?

448
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I live in center of the California

449
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Camera's all over the place

450
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Oh, really?

451
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
They've got cameras where you live?

452
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I see cameras on and in buses all over

453
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And they've got little tiny cameras on those

454
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
The pool on top of every street life

455
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Really?

456
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah

457
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Ah, you know, those cameras just to watch the traffic

458
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Or you know, or to catch speeding

459
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Speeders or people who pop through the red light

460
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Or what do you think?

461
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I have no idea what those little cameras are for

462
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But they have a couple of steam cameras

463
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
That they stopped using several years ago

464
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Hmm

465
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Okay, I didn't know that

466
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I mean, that's interesting

467
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I had no idea that there were

468
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
That this was happening in the States as well

469
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Hmm

470
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
There's not really as much

471
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Like in other countries, but I do see cameras if I look

472
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Huh

473
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
That's news to me

474
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Ron's strupe is on Ron you

475
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You're in Louisiana

476
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Yeah, I thought Ron was on

477
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Okay, I guess he's not

478
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
All right, we'll we'll get back to the live

479
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Calls in a second

480
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Ah, Ron, thank you

481
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Go ahead Ron

482
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I don't know

483
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Okay, finally figured out what's needed

484
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Ah, yeah, I'm in Shreveport, Louisiana

485
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Which is right across the river from Bozier City

486
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Which is right next to

487
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Parkstill Air Force Base

488
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And they're going to

489
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And still or build a

490
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Cyber Command Center here

491
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Which will house

492
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
In the, I guess the spike of Dearest

493
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Or all of the country

494
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
To find terrorism

495
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And I'm not

496
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You know, not too surprised

497
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
We haven't seen a lot of cameras come up

498
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
lately, but

499
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Now they're going to be sniffing over

500
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
All the computers

501
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
All the internet connections

502
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
All right, well, I mean, of course

503
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
There's no illusion that isn't happening

504
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Already

505
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
All right, that's true

506
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
They've been doing it for a while

507
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But the problem is

508
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's going to be a huge facility

509
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And it's not only going to be helpful

510
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
To local people as well as the Air Force

511
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And

512
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
To the security of the country, but I think it's going to be

513
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You're going to really increase the

514
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Technology that they're using now

515
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And probably we'll see something

516
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Start happening in the next year

517
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
But wouldn't be surprised

518
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That they don't start listening to podcasts

519
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Well, I'm telling you

520
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Just based upon the shows that I've been doing

521
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I'm hoping I get back into United Kingdom

522
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm sure they're listening to me, dude

523
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Yeah, you better be careful

524
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
When you bring in and take out

525
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Oh, no, no, I'm

526
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm clean as a whistle, my friend

527
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I may be radical

528
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But I'm not stupid

529
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Yeah, I understand that

530
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah, I understand that, I do understand that

531
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Right now

532
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I got one question about John C. The war act

533
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Is that right?

534
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
That go ahead

535
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You know what, what does his job

536
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's fine show

537
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You know, that's a damn good question

538
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'm going to have to ask him out on Friday

539
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I have no idea what he's doing

540
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I will say there were a lot of people

541
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You know, question

542
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Why he still does cranky geeks

543
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'd rather strange and, you know, obviously

544
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You know, there's a lot of people who are on the pod show

545
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Now work with prior

546
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Prior work or we're doing different things for other people

547
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And, you know, I don't mind sharing the love, man

548
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I don't want to lock everyone into doing one particular thing

549
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But John is working on

550
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
A tech channel

551
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
There's a lot of stuff coming up here at pod show

552
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
A lot of changes that you'll probably see in the next 14 days

553
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Primarily great news for people who

554
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Produce shows

555
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
We've got some great camps

556
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
A great money making campaigns

557
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Anyone can participate in

558
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And we're going to open it up much wider than just people who are signed to pod show

559
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So stay tuned for that

560
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And I promise you on Friday

561
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I'll ask John what the hell he actually does pod show

562
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Okay

563
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Thanks for checking in

564
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Let's get back to the United Kingdom

565
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Here's Parkie to talk to us about

566
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
In the UK, but privacy in general

567
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And in particular

568
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
About this new anti-terror campaign

569
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Which essentially, if you look at credit.com

570
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You'll see the posters

571
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
They're saying hey, if you see someone taking pictures of public buildings

572
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
That looks suspicious or if you see suspicious activity near someone's house

573
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Or

574
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
If someone has multiple cell phones

575
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Which probably could be anyone who's sitting in the conference call right now

576
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm sure all of you geeks have multiple cell phones

577
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You're being asked to report them

578
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And this to me is very concerning

579
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Now, M spoke

580
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Who left a couple comments on the blog over curry.com

581
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
He said hey man, this is nothing new

582
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
We had this with the IRA in the 70s

583
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And I have to agree actually I did some Google work and I searched around

584
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And it almost exactly the same words are used

585
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So it does make sense

586
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I think there's a big difference though

587
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That with this terrorism, it has a face

588
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And this face has been plastered all over

589
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Newspapers, television, everywhere

590
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And not fairly of course

591
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But that face

592
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Probably looks like a lot of

593
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Legal, hardworking, honest, and often citizens of the United Kingdom

594
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Who came in from Asia

595
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And

596
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I think that that's going to present a lot of problems

597
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm quite worried about it. Anyway, I'm a lot of parky talk

598
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Hi Adam, it's parky checking in

599
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm coming back to you on your reply to my email about the UK's

600
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Very Own Starsy Informant Service earlier on

601
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And you asked me how I felt about it and to be honest

602
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Until I'd read taking liberties, I kind of knew this was all going on

603
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But I was asleep walking right into

604
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
My buddy Carl is my resident conspiracy theory in

605
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Weird News 7 and he's regularly getting my head from completely going to sleep

606
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm going to see various cars with news block

607
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But he wasn't until I read taking liberties

608
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
That my eyes really own right up

609
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And the book jammed a hand from those red pills right there

610
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I got it

611
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
By the way, if you haven't seen it yet

612
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You have to take a look at this documentary

613
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Taking Liberty, so there's a post

614
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I'll put it in the show now, but there is a post on

615
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'm curry.com where I put the first

616
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I think it's 9 episodes because it's YouTube stuff

617
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Right, so they can only upload 10 minutes

618
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It shows that there's a lot of issues in the UK

619
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That just aren't being talked about

620
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So it looks like the red pill went down smoothly

621
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
He probably here in the UK is the vast majority of people

622
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Still sound asleep and have no inclination, desire

623
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Even a need to wake up and kind of smell the coffee

624
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Let me give you a instance

625
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I was talking to some folks about the whole CCTV

626
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
The other day and the line from the taking liberties

627
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Book came to mind

628
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
When they said, yeah, CCTV

629
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You've got nothing to fear if you've got nothing to hide

630
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And the comeback hunk of from the book is to ask a very simple

631
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Question straight back to them, which is, well, how much do you earn?

632
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yeah, there is nothing to be ashamed of

633
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Question, nothing to be fearful of question

634
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
But it's personal and here's the thing

635
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It's private and I have no need to tell people that kind of stuff

636
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Yeah, and I had this conversation with the lady Patricia again today

637
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
That was talking about all these posters

638
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And this whole anti-terrorist campaign

639
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And she has a very typical view

640
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And she says, look, I'm really happy about this

641
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'm happy that there's cameras

642
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And I have nothing to hide and I said, okay, why do you close the curtains then?

643
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You got nothing to hide?

644
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Can people, you mind if people look in and see what we're doing?

645
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
She said, no, that's different, I said, no, no, it's not different

646
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Oh man, I can't wait to do a show with her

647
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's going to be fireworks

648
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And these idiots in charge are asleep walking themselves into a police state

649
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I'm pretty sure there's no grand conspiracy plan here

650
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I freaking out there isn't

651
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But I'm caring government is doing their best to protect us

652
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
By a reacting like a 51st day of the union

653
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
adopting all George W. Bush's ideas

654
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And be trying their best to protect us from terrorism

655
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You know, stuff though

656
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
We had years and years and years of the IRA trying their best to blow us up

657
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
We don't need this additional surveillance crap to do that

658
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
We looked after ourselves perfectly well during the blitz

659
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
We looked after ourselves perfectly well during the IRA time

660
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So get off our banks guys

661
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You know, that's a very good point

662
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I view the British public as

663
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Amazing people

664
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
After 7-7 which is the UK's 9-11

665
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
7th July

666
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Man, everyone was just like screw this shit

667
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
We're not going to let anyone bring us down

668
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
We're going back to work, we're not staying home

669
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Even at the office, you know

670
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
We said everyone, hey, if you feel uncomfortable

671
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And stay home and I was like, no crap

672
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
No, we're not going to do that

673
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So I agree

674
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
If all those cameras are there, you know

675
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
How come we have to start reporting on each other?

676
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You know, no good is going to come of it

677
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
By the way, didn't an innocent man get killed

678
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Shot to death multiple times

679
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Because he was acting suspiciously

680
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I just wish they'd get over the nanny's state

681
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And give us a lice back

682
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I think once the British people wake up and realise

683
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
What's happening to them some of this

684
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
The trouble is murdering the sun, the times, and the news of the world

685
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Right, something else, whoever's in power

686
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Now hold on a second

687
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I've got to go against that

688
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Because what the sun and news of the world

689
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
and the Murdoch publications are doing

690
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
They are, of course, giving you what you want

691
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
You know, this is clearly the type of news that we want to see

692
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
For some reason, we desire it

693
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I don't necessarily believe that there's some conspiracy theory there

694
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And that the government calls up Murdoch and says, hey man

695
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
But it's a more scary shit in there

696
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I think we actually want it

697
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
We want to be scared

698
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Maybe it gives us a feeling of living

699
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I don't know, it's something we should delve into

700
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Oh, you know, I should get to

701
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Robin from InsideWorks on the show to talk about that

702
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
He would probably have some good inside

703
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Which, of course, is why it shows called InsideWorks

704
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
It doesn't matter whether it's labour or the Conservatives

705
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Murdoch has supported the in power parties

706
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
In each train through his media interests

707
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Being left well alone

708
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It's about time we'd galvanize the British people

709
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
To take back our civil liberties

710
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And that matters the American people while we're at it

711
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Yeah, the yanks have got it just as bad

712
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
If not worse in some respects

713
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
At least we don't have the bleeding TSA

714
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And depending on the opponents' security

715
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
To contend with

716
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'd have to say you're getting pretty damn close man

717
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I go through UK security quite a lot

718
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Which, by the way, is full of holes

719
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
If you've ever flown internationally

720
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And I've made a sport of this now

721
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
If you fly internationally out of Heathrow

722
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
First you go through security

723
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Now you don't have to take your shoes off

724
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
At UK security when you go through the metal detector

725
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
In fact, these days

726
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You don't even have to take your laptop out

727
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And I'm about to find out how that's going to be

728
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And on a national flight tomorrow

729
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
When I fly to Los Angeles for the day

730
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
But then once you're through there

731
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Then you hit kind of like a custom's exit point

732
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Which is basically five or six

733
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Rolls that you go through and then some

734
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Clearly unqualified person looks at your passport

735
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
They don't check anything

736
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
They just look at your passport

737
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Check the name against the ticket

738
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And then you're supposed to walk through

739
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Another line which is

740
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Specifically meant to put your shoes

741
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Onto another x-ray machine

742
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But this is the way it's set up

743
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
You can go off to the right

744
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Which is where you get there's the change bureau

745
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
So you can change your money

746
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Or you can go off to the left and they typically have some monkey

747
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Stand in there trying to ask you into this

748
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Into this shoe x-ray line

749
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So what I do is I get into the left hand exit row

750
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
For you know the so-called like passport check

751
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And then if the guy or gal who's standing there isn't looking

752
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I just walked to the left and walk right past it

753
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I've done it three times in a row now

754
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
It's the stupidest thing in the world

755
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So it clearly has you know has no official

756
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Resonant for being around because they're not enforcing it

757
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And how easy is it just to surpass it

758
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So I didn't have to take my shoes off through the first x-ray machine

759
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And I bypass the second one

760
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's clearly horseshit

761
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I'm just saying

762
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
The trouble is there's so much to do

763
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Where do we stop?

764
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Let us step on brace ourselves to argue

765
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
So bear ourselves

766
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
But it's the brick empire

767
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And it's commonwealth

768
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Lost, brought by India

769
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Men will still pay

770
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Never give up

771
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Never surrender

772
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
There you go then

773
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I think a bit of Winston Churchill combined with

774
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Galaxie Quest says, oh man

775
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Pocky checking out

776
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Take him and bye

777
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Listen to this week in London

778
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It's a bloody marvelous podcast

779
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Lovely, Parkie, thank you so much

780
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Men, I really appreciate it

781
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You gave me some good fodder for today's show

782
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So I'm going to open it up and I want to hear if anyone has something to say

783
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
In fact, I'm going to be screening myself during the next song

784
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
This is a song that I posted the YouTube video on curry.com last night

785
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And I have the MP3 actually

786
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Let me just see if I can give some prompts here

787
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
To the person that sent it to me

788
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Here we go

789
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Rick

790
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Quality on teen, I think is how you pronounce it

791
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
He sent me the MP3 in the link to the YouTube video

792
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's hilarious

793
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It is completely not safe for work

794
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It is absolutely not safe for a young

795
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Impressionable ears

796
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
But it's a hoot and the video is even better

797
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It's the TSA gangsta's

798
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Talking about

799
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
The TSA gangsta's

800
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Check it out y'all

801
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I walk into the Austin International and

802
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Orpac trip

803
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
TSA gangsta's up in this arrow

804
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You can't be bringing that shit on a plane

805
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
No more mother fuck

806
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Get your shit right

807
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
War

808
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Grail, buckle, money, clip, going keys

809
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Wallet, bird, put some D-cell

810
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Let run it through

811
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Grail, buckle, money, clip

812
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Goin, keys, wallet, bird

813
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Put some D-cell, let run it through

814
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Ooh, don't be choppy, good

815
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I had it since Easter

816
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And all my breaks I'm bangin' that star box

817
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Paul Reaster

818
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I think it's corkscrew

819
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
You like this in your mat

820
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Books, damn it got enough

821
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
But I don't want it to save the fucking queen

822
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Got this on the arrowhead

823
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Give me all this spark lens

824
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Call it so good, Paul, and Springs

825
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Keep my little soul wet

826
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Girl, I can't let you bring on

827
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
More than four ounces

828
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Unless you want to show me how you're fat

829
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Pretty boozy, we confiscate your lick

830
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It's cause you know they pose a threat

831
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I'll even confiscate your pussy if I make it through

832
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Damn I hate to see that breast milk

833
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Go to waste, but you can come right through

834
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
If you give me a tip

835
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Be a buckle, money, clip

836
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Goin, keys, wallet, bird

837
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Put some D-cell

838
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Son, let, run it through

839
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Damn buckle, money, crib

840
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Goin, keys, wallet, bird

841
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Put some D-cell, let, run it through

842
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I'm a knee, $50

843
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
If you know what I mean

844
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I saw you bigger, still Moïmer and Traim machine

845
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Motherfucker took these shoes off

846
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Before you come stepping

847
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yo, I think this apple could be used

848
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I don't care

849
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I can breathe just down

850
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Fouls and knives of every type

851
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Even CBD, the blades doesn't work

852
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Wethlessly snob

853
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,620
I'm checking gold, played in pen, not bitch

854
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,260
And that's reality, you better lose your pre

855
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,340
911 mentality

856
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:24,620
Hey, oh, look, oh money, crap, boy, he's wallet purse

857
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,680
Put some D's, oh, they're running through

858
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,260
Hey, oh, look, oh, money, crap, boy, he's wallet purse

859
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,380
Put some D's, oh, they're running through

860
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,180
Hey, oh, hey, oh, he's saying, yeah

861
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,460
And we don't break, says that TSA gangsters

862
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,820
No, we don't gangster, that TSA gangsters

863
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,020
No, we don't break, that TSA gangsters

864
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:50,740
No, we don't pizza, oh, hey, they're sweet, you fly to Paris with your mama

865
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,700
Tell the bridge to shape, and she's looking like no son

866
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,820
I'm even thinking, coming through with you a terror risk

867
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,620
We gotta say, he's bodybuilder from a male

868
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,780
Who bitch, how can I be sure you ain't a member of our kinda

869
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,820
Now excuse my wand, as I slide it up inside

870
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,860
I'm just a kid, I need a change in 2001

871
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,460
Let me squeeze them titties are the terror risk of already won

872
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,140
Oh, they'll block the money, crap, boy, he's wallet purse

873
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,340
Put some D's, oh, they're running through

874
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,780
Hey, oh, look, oh, money, crap, boy, he's wallet purse

875
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,100
Put some D's, oh, they're running through

876
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,860
You're running across some more Lego-rattin' duty free

877
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,220
Cause that Johnny Walker blew a stain in here, written me

878
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,500
Hey, hit me, you gotta suspicious looking face

879
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,700
Let me bump in that ass like maria full of grass

880
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:43,140
You got weed up in your shoe working, you're tainted in a locket

881
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,220
By the time you want the plane, I fall in the mall, he's in a mall, fuck

882
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,620
Yes, we, I score my girls, some Chanel, number five

883
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,900
Lady handle with a perfume, or you gonna have to dry

884
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,660
The leaves in five minutes and you're running late

885
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,940
I'm so fucking sorry play, I get your ass back in light

886
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,860
But what'll lead on the conveyor?

887
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:03,140
Rea, bak, homony, clip, going keys, wallet purse

888
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:06,260
Put some D's, oh, they running through

889
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:09,860
Rea, bak, homony, clip, going keys, wallet purse

890
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,820
Put some D's, oh, they running through

891
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,860
Hey, TSA gangsta's

892
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,660
Link to the YouTube system, the show notes, a Debbie Source

893
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:29,460
The first code dot com as gangsters, yo we don't gangsters. Thanks for flying Kanye South West mother fucker

894
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:38,180
Oh man, is that a song at the times and I really appreciate those guys for putting that song together

895
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:42,340
And the video because you know they'll get absolutely zero airplay on commercial radio

896
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,500
So well done well done well done

897
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:49,300
I think we should wrap the show up. It's kind of late and of course we don't have any

898
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:58,420
Any UK people on so we'll just have to you know get back into that when I'm back in the UK and back on a different different times

899
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,660
Own although I must say the little conversation we had earlier worked out pretty well

900
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,020
I think

901
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,020
Hey Adam this is perhaps from Houston

902
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,740
I've got a question for you. What's the how do I win?

903
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,940
Hope you win. What are we all competing for?

904
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,940
Given the lifestyle that you have it sounds like you've already won

905
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:21,220
Are we already winning competing and was the pop show as we are right now?

906
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,220
Great here

907
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,220
You already won Adam and

908
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,820
Love you man. No home. All right man. Love you too. No mama. Thank you so much

909
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,860
All right, uh looking at the time. I think we should wrap it up. I got one more song is relatively short

910
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:40,980
But I received this email and and in combination with the song it it really hit me pretty deep

911
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,620
So I'm gonna read this for you and then I'll play the song

912
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,060
This is from a brand and carpenter Adam

913
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:52,180
I know being away from home has got you down and often this will take your eyes off the many subjects

914
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,380
You are working on but here's something you need to put your eyes on

915
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:03,300
Body of war is a documentary about Thomas Young a disabled veteran of the legal war upon the people of Iraq

916
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:10,900
The documentaries produced and directed by Phil Donahue. That's interesting and the award winning director Ellen Spiro

917
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,860
Man Phil Donahue. He's doing some awesome stuff

918
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,340
The soundtrack is produced mainly by Michael Goldstone and Eddie Vetter

919
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,740
Eddie of course we know from

920
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:24,820
Shit Eddie Vetter was an intern at MTV believe it or not, but that's a story for a different day

921
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:31,620
The feature track is by Eddie Vetter. It's called no more, but this is track that's available on the pont safe music network by boy genius

922
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,860
Bright eyes

923
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:39,460
That's a Connor Oberst of saddle Creek records the track is when the president talks to God

924
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:45,700
It's simply poignant in the same vein as Bob Dylan or any of the 60s anti war folk songs

925
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:51,220
It's gotten lots of pod plays, so please give it a listen. All right here comes

926
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,700
It's short. It's simple and it's sweet into the points

927
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,620
When the president talks to God on the Charlie

928
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,940
729er

929
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,780
When the president

930
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,300
talks to God or the conversation's brief for long

931
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:17,380
Does he ask to rape our women's rights and send poor farm kids off to die? Does God suggest an oil hack when the president talks to God?

932
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,420
When the president talks to God or the

933
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:33,380
Consonance or harder soft is he resolute all down the line is every issue black or white does what God say

934
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,900
I have a change his mind when the president talks to God

935
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:45,780
When the president talks to God does he fake that draw or merely not

936
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:51,460
A sandwich convict should be killed where prison should be built and failed

937
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:56,500
Which voter fraud must be concealed when the president talks to God?

938
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:08,340
When the president talks to God, I wonder which one plays the better cop

939
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,620
We should find some jobs to get us broke

940
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:17,300
No, they're lazy George, I say we don't just give them more liquor stores and dirty coke

941
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,540
That's what God recommends

942
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:31,700
When the president talks to God, do they drink near beer and go play golf while they pick which countries to invade?

943
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:37,940
Which Muslims souls still can't be saved? I guess God just calls a spade a spade

944
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,940
When the president talks to God

945
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:52,180
When the president talks to God, does he ever think that maybe he's not?

946
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:58,180
The divorce is just inside his head when he kneels next to the presidential bed

947
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:05,140
Does he ever smell his own bullshit? When the president talks to God, I doubt him

948
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,700
I doubt him

949
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,900
Man, yeah, one really hits home doesn't it? It's on the pod save music now

950
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:26,580
Work with means you can get to it from the show notes a daily sourceco.com and better than you're in your blog

951
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:30,500
I'd say we've got a great great player you could use to embed it

952
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,940
All right everybody, I think that's pretty much it for the show

953
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,700
We've oh man, we've been at it for 51 about 51 minutes so

954
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:44,420
Time to wrap it up. I do want to remind you that we have this fantastic deal just to get into the commerce for a second

955
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:50,500
On the Nokia N8010 internet tablet and this is not for everyone but I know that there's a lot of people

956
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:56,580
Listening to the show who if you love Linux then this is the this is the device for you. I'm telling you

957
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:03,060
You're gonna love it. It has a Mozilla based browser that does all the web 2.0 stuff

958
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:09,140
And what I use it for is for all my my Google docs my Gmail, you know, it has the slide out keyboard

959
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:13,460
So you know again, I've been staying it throughout the show. I'm I'm definitely a keyboard guy and

960
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:19,940
You know, you can use all the keyboard shortcuts and of course the number one

961
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:25,060
Massively cool thing is that you can use Skype on it. You can't get that on your iPhone and by the way

962
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,540
I'm not looking for

963
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:33,380
You know, I want a device that is just an internet device. I'm you know the combination of the two

964
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:37,780
And of course if you drop it in the toilet you can take the battery out and still save it

965
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:46,420
If you want to if you want to pick one up at a 15% discount you can't get a cheaper anywhere else online or in stores for that matter
