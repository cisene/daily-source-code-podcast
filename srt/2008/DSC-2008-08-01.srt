Delta Shara Charley, 7-7-9-R.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We don't need enough digging trees in.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Delta Shara Charley, 7-7-9-R.

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We don't need enough digging trees in.

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Delta Shara Charley, 7-7-R.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We don't need enough digging trees in.

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Delta Shara Charley, 7-7-R.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We don't need enough digging trees in.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Delta Shara Charley, 7-7-R.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We don't need enough digging trees in.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Delta Shara Charley, 7-R.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We don't need enough digging trees in.

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Delta Shara Charley, 7-R.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We don't need enough digging trees in.

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Delta Shara Charley, 7-R.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We don't need enough digging trees in.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Delta Shara Charley, 7-R.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We don't need enough digging trees in.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Delta Shara Charley, 7-R.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We don't need enough digging trees in.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Delta Shara Charley, 7-7-R.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We don't need enough digging trees in.

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Delta Shara Charley, 9-R.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We don't need enough digging trees in.

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Delta Shara Charley, 7-R.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We don't need enough digging trees in.

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Delta Shara Charley, 9-R.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We don't need enough digging trees in.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Delta Shara Charley, 7-R.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Life's weak, so we live enough in the dead lives

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:16,000
With my dead be a scar, but this town doesn't have to pay him tonight

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
These dreams start to seem when we have no word

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In all my life, I don't know that I ever hurt your life

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't know that I ever hurt your life

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You and your knowledge are falling together

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We'll walk again, you and your knowledge has been paid

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We'll walk again, we'll walk again

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We'll walk again, we'll walk again

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We'll walk again, we'll walk again

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We'll walk again

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I want to wake up, you can't scream

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I will know I'll wake up, you can't scream

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I want to know that my heart will be there

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There's a reason, I'm leaving

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I want to wake up, you can't scream

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I want to live, I can know what I'm leaving

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I want to know that my heart will be there

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There's a reason, there's a reason

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm bleeding, here we are now in the forest sky

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We'll walk again, you and your knowledge has been paid

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We'll walk again, we'll walk again

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We'll walk again, we'll walk again

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We'll walk again, you and your knowledge have been paid

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's the daily source code, episode 779, the Charlie's on, and yes, once again, is a

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
food bar Friday.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Everybody, how you doing?

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Coming here from the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Gilford in the United Kingdom, from

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
the Curry Manor.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's your buddy, Adam.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
They chuckle at the time you're doing.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh boy, yes, yes, yes.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Time for a food bar Friday, addition of the daily source code, could not be happier.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,320
Although, of course, it's a very typical food bar because the minute I set up the MacBook

65
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,000
Pro to get to work, and all of a sudden, the levels are off, the sound is all funky.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And maybe it could just be my ears.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't know, man.

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I've been pretty deeply embedded into the sound for the past week or so.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And actually yesterday, I had a whole show prepped ready to go.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And I decided, you know, as is pretty typical after the weekend, and after we've done kind of

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
a topic based show, then I want to get all your feedback, and I want to put that into

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
one program.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So I got a whole bunch of voicemail comments, and they really affected me.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And I actually, well, I'll get to that in a second.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
First, I have to blow out a huge May, a culpa boy.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I did some really stupid.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
A lot of you noticed it.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yesterday, I got word from the guys over at drop.io, which, of course, we use all the

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
time here on the charity for sharing files and PDFs and MP3s and embedded videos, all kinds

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
of stuff.

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's a drop.io slash daily source code.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And they said, hey, we got something really cool set up for you.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You know, you can now add a notification with a link to your Twitter account.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
They'd actually set up a separate account, which was Twitter.com slash daily source code.

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And I tried it and it worked.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I added something in perfect.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh, this is cool, man.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm going to put this.

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm going to link this to to my Adam Curry Twitter account.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And they went something cool as uploaded.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You know, everyone will know about it.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, here's the thing I did wrong.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I tested it by sending a test message that said, let's see if this works from drop.io.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That was a big mistake because then immediately people are like, oh, wait a minute.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Here's a way to basically look like Adam and post stuff.

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And they were posted notes on the drop.io slash daily source code.

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And it just kind of imploded within like 30 seconds.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Everyone was sending messages through my account, which was exactly what I didn't want

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
to happen.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's my own stupid fault for sending the kind of hello world test message.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So I guess I got what I deserved.

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And it was this is kind of the audio version of the email and the twitters and the tweets.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I should say that I started receiving.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Please.

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
God.

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Please turn off that Twitter stream.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You don't mind heading.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm sweaty.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Some fucking messages.

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
In 30 minutes and still going.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I want to subscribe.

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I've emailed you.

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Please stop.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I can't believe the only one who he is.

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Had you doing it.

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm not going to bother doing all the rest of it.

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Cause you.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
As I know.

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Nah, I totally messed that up.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I am so sorry.

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And a lot of people said I would actually break Twitter doing stuff like that.

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Which I guess it could happen considering I have.

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What is it like?

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I had six sixty three hundred followers.

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Let me just check for a second.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'll betcha.

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll betcha.

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That number's gone down.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Let me see.

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Twitter.com slash Adam Curry.

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Let's see.

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What does it come up with?

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I think it was sixty three hundred six thousand three hundred.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Now I have.

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yep.

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Six thousand one hundred and twenty.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Or probably about a good two hundred people.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
As shipman, I'm sorry.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You guys can come back.

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I've turned it all off.

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I had really stopped posting.

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Anything on Twitter because so often I'd fire up Twitter or

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
a Faker, one of these other clients and get time out.

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's all kinds of errors.

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And then kind of the spontaneous nature of it just.

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Kind of dropped away.

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay, lots of stuff to talk about.

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
As I said, mainly your phone calls today.

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
First, the couple things straight out of the news.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Exxon mobile reported their best quarterly profit.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,840
quarterly profit ever for a corporation ever for a corporation. Okay, for any corporation ever

154
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:34,080
Beating its own record, by the way. With a total of 11.68 billion dollars in the second quarter. That's three months

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,360
That's like $90,000 a second. No a minute. I'm sorry. $90,000 a minute during the quarter.

156
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,120
And then of course the Anglo Dutch company shell oil. Ah, they didn't do too bad either. I presume

157
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,240
still partially owned by the by the royal Dutch family or by the queen. Maybe she salais a little bit

158
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,880
left there. She would only need a little bit to be pretty happy. Quarterly profit. 11.56 billion dollars.

159
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,720
And that's up from 8.67 billion dollars in the same period one year ago. This is a lot of money, okay?

160
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,200
And this is a lot of money. Charles Schumer, Chuck, Democrat from New York says inside the

161
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,240
board rooms at all major oil companies. It's Christmas in July. What's shopping? What's shocking?

162
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,560
He says that big oil is plowing these profits into stock buybacks instead of increasing production

163
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,680
or investing in alternative energy. Yeah, it's exactly what my stomach says. Oh, man. Bandits I tell you.

164
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,560
Massive bandits. Then there's another thing. And by the way, this is all coming off. Most of this is

165
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,760
coming off of drop.io slash daily source code, which has just become my total resource for almost

166
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,680
anything. And I will post this link. I think that this link did actually come from

167
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:57,680
from the drop. It's a list of banks which have failed recently and a lot of them from this past

168
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,560
week or so. It's about 50 banks here. Let me see. We have banks in California, Nevada, Arizona,

169
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:13,360
Missouri, Florida, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Connecticut, Ohio, Texas, Arkansas, New Hampshire,

170
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,200
Hanalulu, the Bank of Hanalulu and belly up. I went belly up. What is it? Oh, that went belly

171
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,800
up in 2005. But there's a lot of 2008's July 25th. It's coming down. So on the one hand, we've got

172
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,600
the banks failing massively, just kaput running out of money. The federal reserve has opened up

173
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,280
the till, come on through borrow as much as you want. The oil companies are making huge profits.

174
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,960
And I feel like I've just got shafted up the butt. Anyway, so that's just the kind of news

175
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,120
that I'm seeing every single day and boy the quality that you guys are putting on drop.io slash

176
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,080
daily source code is going up. I really love it. And then of course, the phone call. So yesterday,

177
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,760
you know, and I've been doing a lot of stuff for the Dutch radio things in early in the morning.

178
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,440
And so yesterday, I was like, okay, let's do a show. I'm ready to, you know, I'd

179
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,040
already kind of pre-prept a lot of stuff. I started to listen to some more of the phone calls.

180
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,240
Because of course, there was a lot of them from us since past weekend. And in particular, this

181
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,120
next one, which I'm going to play for you, it was a combination of a whole bunch of things.

182
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:23,120
I guess the process of my own awakening. And I heard this from California Dave. And I had to,

183
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,960
I went for a walk. I had to go for a really long walk. I laid down for an hour or two to go to sleep.

184
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,440
And then by the time I was kind of down from this confusion, it really was.

185
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,960
And there's a lot more, you know, today we're also going to hear a lot of comments

186
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,800
against the conspiracy theories, which I'm very happy with because I've been waiting for people to

187
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,040
come up and, you know, step up and say, hey, wait a minute, this is going too far. I don't believe it.

188
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,640
Or I have a different opinion. So combine with all of that and what California Dave had to say,

189
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,760
it really just blew me away. And, you know, by the time I was kind of back to any, any version of

190
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,080
normal, it was almost too late because we had conference calls coming up with San Francisco, which is

191
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,760
of course, is a part of my third day job.

192
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,480
I think it was happening around me. None of it mattered. I was ignorant and I was happy being

193
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,520
just since your show might have been open. I've totally taken the red bill. I'm totally

194
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,440
earning none of the red of red at all. Things are now making sense to me. And I've seen

195
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,440
I've seen the world in a different life. Now, on top of that, the reason I, like I said,

196
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,200
the reason I called the ones of thank you, while the reason I want to thank you is because

197
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,400
you helped and give me meaning in life. Before the show, before the thing to you, I was just

198
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:58,480
another, under-cheating connector. So, doing nothing on my life, I had nowhere to go. I was

199
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,720
happy being in a shit job. Now, you have money to rise. Since the BSC and since listening to you

200
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,040
of now back in school, I'm now working my way towards a bachelor's in political science.

201
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,600
I'm officially joined the libertarian party. I want to be part of that revolution.

202
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,520
You know, and on top of all that, because we're on the show, I'm now still thinking it's

203
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,040
making the country of our great again that I plan on running for office once I graduate.

204
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,880
So, thank you out. They give so much of being there for speaking with a little people

205
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,480
and for being that with a voice when we don't have it. So, again, thank you very much.

206
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,160
One of the things we're really quick about, I just want to ask you, because I am very new to this.

207
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,720
And most of my information I get from you, I get from the BSC and I get from other show

208
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,760
kind of similar to your, that I speak in the truth. But what, where should I look? You know,

209
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,760
I want to reset. I'm hungry for nothing. What would you suggest for newspapers?

210
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,520
News program websites, well, good ones for someone like me, who's dying to learn more,

211
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,920
where can I, what would you recommend to me, and anyone else?

212
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,240
So, yeah, again, thank you very much for the bottom of my heart. Thank you for everything.

213
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,080
And, you know, after me, I'm 29. I'm a little clap on a middle lower clap white male, a total folder,

214
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:21,280
now in the red row and I'm starting to work for you. So, so you hear that, right? And it just blew me away.

215
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,640
I was like, yeah, of course future president of the United States of America. Why not?

216
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:34,240
California, Dave? Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah. I love that. And for some, whatever reason, just the

217
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,680
the, the planet, the stars, the moon, everything. It just, it, it, it like blew me away. I'm like,

218
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:46,320
wow, this stupid show has that kind of impact. But to really hear someone wake up like that,

219
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,520
that's significantly, I was like, hell, yeah, I'm digging this, man. California, Dave,

220
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,600
uh, keep in touch with us. Let me give you some advice, because I did think about this during my walk.

221
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,440
You know, where, you know, you're new to this. And so, I would say, you know, listen to, listen to,

222
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,400
shows that they do feel tried a lot of stuff and can, can give you a highlight. I mean, it can be

223
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,720
really, um, energy consuming to follow up conspiracies. And by the way, I'm not going to say

224
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,760
conspiracy theories, because they're all the conspiracy theories. Hey, you know, I have a book here on

225
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:25,760
the bookshelf, which is, uh, the 911, uh, commissions report. That's a theory. It's a conspiracy theory.

226
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:32,880
Just a different one. Um, so, you know, listen with caution. And really, the place I could send you,

227
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,040
the best place, if you aspire to be president of the United States, which you've got it all in

228
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,720
you, man, absolutely. Um, this document called the Constitution, go have a look at that and compare

229
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,080
everything that's happening around you right now in the United States, compare that California, Dave,

230
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,440
to what you read in the Constitution. And that should be a great reference manual for you. And

231
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,080
by the way, everybody out there, go ahead and pick up a copy of this thing. The founding fathers

232
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,280
had some pretty good ideas. And, uh, so maybe you listen a bit of the source code. Maybe you should

233
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:15,680
check out, uh, the, uh, campaign for liberty, uh, which is, uh, Dr. Ron Paul's latest initiative.

234
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,600
And of course, so we'll be talking later on about the rally for, for the Republic, which I'm taking

235
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,680
part in. Um, and, uh, and, and the Constitution, that's really it, man, California, Dave,

236
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,200
will be a great president. I can't wait. Keep us up to speed on what's going on. Will you

237
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:40,000
please? Oh, I'm proud of you, casting with Adam Curry. Hey, it is a full bar. Hey, Adam,

238
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,280
it's time for hit this number 132. Okay, okay. Hey, we're going to start right away with intro.

239
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:55,040
Number one. Oh, easy. I got, I know, this one. That would be, uh, ABC, is it, it's either the

240
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:03,840
look of law, I think it's the look of love ABC. Number two. Oh, no, Torea, Durand, Durand.

241
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:13,280
Yeah, for these songs from like 89, 91, 91, maybe, 90, and the final one is number three.

242
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,800
Uh, the Peshmode enjoyed the silence. Yes, I think I've made it. I think I got six out of six.

243
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,880
Way too easy, John. I know all of these. And here are the answers.

244
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,280
And this is answer number one.

245
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,880
Uh, one smokey sings. All right, five out of C. That was smokey sing. That was fun.

246
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,680
ABC is answer number one. And this is answer number two.

247
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,240
Durand Durand. Song is also from

248
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,520
the Peshmode. Durand Durand, Torea's answer number two.

249
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,480
And this is answer number three.

250
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,120
This is the Peshmode. This song from

251
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:20,480
The Peshmode is answer number three. We've enjoyed the silence from 1990.

252
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,120
And this is for hit test number 132. So, Adam,

253
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,680
what are you doing? I'll be honest, I got five out of six. I got ABC's title wrong, but I

254
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,680
knew it after the facts. So, five out of six,

255
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:39,440
John for this week's 132. All righty, the answers to this hit test. And then the older hit test as well.

256
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
And also the links to iTunes, so you can buy the tricks,

257
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,080
feature the hit test online. I'll have to be found at hittest.meepio.com.

258
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,280
Adam, thanks for playing again. Thank you, my friend. Everyone else, again. Thank you for listening.

259
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,600
Next week, I'll be back for another hit test. So, until then, take care. Have fun.

260
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
And remember to try to think with your heart. Bye-bye.

261
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,480
Info, y'all, let that come. Jay and P.O.L.V.T.

262
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,120
Honestly, I got to tell you that the sound sounds,

263
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,800
everything sounds off today, but it's just particularly when I play some music,

264
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,960
no, no, whatever. It's football. What can I tell you? As I promised,

265
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,400
going through tons of your phone calls that have come into the voicemail lines,

266
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,320
you can always find those in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com or curry.com,

267
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,200
or on numerous places across the interwebs.

268
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,880
So, some different thoughts coming through the pipeline this time.

269
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,280
And I can tell, you know, we started off with the awakening by switch foot.

270
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,800
We heard California day of awakening. I think this next guy, I forget his name, but we'll

271
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:50,160
hear in a second. I think he's very close to awakening. And I think he's struggling. I think he's

272
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,920
going through what a lot of people are struggling with right now. Listen to this. This is a comment

273
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,840
on the Lindsey Williams story about how he witnessed how the oil was manipulated in order to save

274
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,960
the US dollar, you know, a quarter of a century ago. I think it was like 20 25 years ago.

275
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,600
And he's back on the scene talking about this very topic. So, here comes some headwind, I guess,

276
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,280
for the direction I'm headed in, but perhaps it's just a tough awakening. Let's check it out.

277
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:27,920
And I know you're getting this stuff, you know, you're publishing all this crap.

278
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,800
And it's not necessarily fact, and you're just throwing it out there, but there's some big, big

279
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:40,960
holes. Somebody is either lying out there, their bum hole, or they're just making shit up,

280
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,760
or it's just completely rumored fabricated. Okay, so you got, you got that wind,

281
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,560
you guys, you know, last guy. You see a preacher up there, you worked around the little rigged.

282
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,560
And he says that we have little rigged, oil reserves in the last guy.

283
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,360
Huge oil reserves. He found that out. We can't talk about it. We can't pump it because if we do,

284
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,680
it'll mess up the US dollar. And he said that the Saudi Arabia, we need Saudi Arabia to buy our

285
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,200
oil in dollars. And for each barrel they buy it after buy a little bit of our debt. I don't even

286
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,440
understand that part. Yeah. And I have to admit, it's at the face of it. It's really complicated.

287
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,320
When you start putting dollars down on the table and cups of oil and you start playing the game

288
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,480
and try and see how it works, how the how the trading mechanisms works. I mean, I actually had

289
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,840
bankers show me how swaps and derivatives worked in exactly that same way by giving me a dollar

290
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,960
and then holding on to a pound and then showing what a derivative swap is. You really have to get

291
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,120
down to that basic. So the deal that Henry Kissinger made in the early 70s with the with the

292
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,520
Saudis was, look, we're going to buy your oil. But you're going to only sell it in dollars.

293
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:57,040
And we're going to pay you a nice amount of money for this oil. But with that, you're going to buy

294
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:02,240
our national debt. Okay. So that doesn't mean that we're not, you know, that they're reducing the debt

295
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,280
by buying it. They're actually underwriting this debt. They're buying our debt, which is how we've

296
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,920
been able to write up all of these huge deficits. That's the closest and the simplest I can get to

297
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,960
explaining that part. Let's continue. Okay. Maybe that's true. And then he said, I am that's

298
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,960
an oil bank set the price for the oil. So it comes out of the ground. They say $5 a gallon or $150

299
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,360
a barrel. We pay $5 a gallon. Well, hold on. It's not exactly like that. And I agree that he

300
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,280
doesn't explain that how that works. I think what he's trying to tell us is that the world bank

301
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:42,720
or the IMF tell the Saudis, here's what you're going to ask for it today. And that the price is set

302
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,680
then then and there. And then of course, there is speculation. And there's some real cost. I mean,

303
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:55,120
refining oil is no joke. I mean, those refineries cost the easily $8 to $10 billion. And we haven't

304
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,680
built enough of them. So there's definitely all kinds of supply and demand issues there.

305
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,760
But if you look at the whole Lindsay story, he also talks about a point and I did go back in

306
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,640
their historical charts. When one of these guys called them up and said, Hey, Lindsay, check this out,

307
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,920
oil is going to go down the 10 bucks watch. And I looked it up and around that period of time,

308
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,000
whether Lindsay made it up or whether it actually did it half in the way he said it did.

309
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,480
Oil and did go down to about $10.5 $11 at one point just around the time period he was talking about.

310
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,800
So I and I'm also not sure how that works. That to me, if there's a hole in the story,

311
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,360
it's right here because I'm not, I just don't understand. I do have a call into my buddy

312
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,960
Captain Dan who, and I actually, I sent him a text message and he did call me earlier. I missed his call.

313
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,960
So we won't know until next week, probably. I want to talk to him. But I said,

314
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:55,040
you know, based upon some reports I've been seeing, does it really cost $80 to get one barrel of oil out of the

315
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,040
ground? Because that's what these oil companies are saying. You know, the same guys that they're just

316
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:07,440
posting $10 billion plus profit for three months worth of business. Profit. More than 10,

317
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,760
and more than 11 billion per company. Because I, you know, if you believe the Lindsay

318
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,360
Williams story, it's anywhere between five and eight bucks of a per barrel to get it out of the

319
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,080
ground. So that's the tough one for me as well. But I'm just trying to follow the trail all the way

320
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,320
back. So I, let's just call that a definite black hole that needs to be addressed. So and supposedly

321
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,760
that money is going to pay off our debt. That's why they raised it. Well, our debt isn't going down.

322
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,480
Right. Okay. So that's what I just said. Right is that they buy our debt. They basically

323
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,360
underwrite parts of our debt. That's, that's what the deal is there. So you get the charge

324
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,360
where you want. We'll make you guys wealthy beyond your wildest dreams. But you've got a support

325
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,720
us financially. It's not even a little bit since the spike since I went up to 150. And then he said,

326
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,560
are you said to eat said did another recording? The Indonesia and Russia have these big oil reserves.

327
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,080
They're going to start pumping oil. And that's going to kill the dollar. But then he said,

328
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,600
that that's the ultimate goal is to kill the dollar so that we could merge Canada, Mexico,

329
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:15,040
and the United States into a big Theresa. Yeah. I believe the merging is part of the, of the

330
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,200
overall plan. I've just been hearing about it too much for too long. About the North American union

331
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:26,400
that that would be a spin-off or derivative of the North American free trade association.

332
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,240
But yeah, in this corridor that goes from Mexico all the way up to Canada. I'm sure you leave

333
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,720
heard about all this stuff. So I think that that's always been in the planning. But how to put it

334
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,480
together. And even the Canadians are making jokes. Now I saw a TV show. This also was on the drop

335
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,400
drop.io slash daily source code. They're making jokes about about this North American union.

336
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,920
And it actually happening. Although you don't really read any congressional documents about it.

337
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:00,960
But that I think is really happening. Now the whole thing with the money, you know, it was bound

338
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,760
to happen. I mean, people have been warning against this for a long time. Congresswoman Wrong

339
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,520
Paul has been warning against this bubble that's going to explode. He said, you know, this has been

340
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,320
going for 30 years. This isn't something that just happened. This is essentially what happens when

341
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:21,360
you just keep printing money. And, you know, have it kind of flimsyly underwritten by oil transactions

342
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,280
that are that are being done in dollars. So everyone needs dollars to buy oil.

343
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,640
That's what's been propping it all up. So this is that's really nothing new. It's just it may be

344
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,920
it's now being used as a great tool to get this North American union together. Because then we

345
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:41,680
have the North American union. We just recently, the president of the European Union,

346
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:49,040
Sarcosi announced the Mediterranean Union. And then, of course, we need an Asia-Pacific union.

347
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,200
And then on top of that, oh, we need is one government that kind of deals with everything.

348
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,200
You know, what did I call it? Yeah, new world order. I do think that's for real. And it's not

349
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,560
something that happens overnight. There's North American union. I don't think we're going to wake up one

350
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,040
day. Oh, here it is. But there's a couple more stepping stones to be taken. I think we'll be able

351
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:14,000
to identify them as they come along. It's the goal is to kill the dollar. Why does it matter who

352
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,760
comes oil where? Why wouldn't it even matter if Iran started selling their oil in your rows?

353
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,720
If the goal is to kill the dollar. In fact, the dollar is already dead. We are heading for the

354
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,960
second depression. Nothing else needs to be done. So, you see, there's someone waking up.

355
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,320
You got that man. You got it. You got it. You're right on the money with that. It's just going to

356
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,720
be used as a tool. So turn it around. And by the way, what we predict today, what we talk about

357
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,520
today could change tomorrow, you know, the way this is being done, this is fluid, you know,

358
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,960
as I said, it's a very long process and the ultimate goal. I do believe that really in my heart,

359
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,800
not just conspiracy theory, but the idea of breaking the world up into unions. I mean, this goes back

360
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:00,640
to the United Nations. This has always been the idea and then to have a government on top of everything.

361
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:07,120
Starfleet Command is what it is. These rumors. What do you call them theories? They just don't

362
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,920
make sense. It doesn't add up. Not that. I don't know. I'm so confused. I want to understand this

363
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:19,760
atom, but it just doesn't make sense. It's hard. It doesn't make sense. At some point, you've got

364
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,480
to protect your family, your country, even a little bit, you know. Oh, man, that time is coming for

365
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,720
sure. In fact, that time is now and what you're going through right now, my friend, that's the awakening.

366
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,920
That is exactly right. And you're going to see that by paying attention and listening closely

367
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,200
and listening to the code words and brushing up on the Constitution, it wouldn't hurt and compared

368
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,160
it to what you're witnessing right now around you. And yeah, check out a couple of sites.

369
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,440
Watch a couple of videos. Google a couple of things. You might even want to go back to,

370
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:02,160
let's see Google Oklahoma City. See if any information that you thought was true in

371
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:08,240
95 and 96 and 96, I think. See if that is change. If there's any other differences of opinions,

372
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,600
see how that relates to more recent events. Think the information is out there. The powerful

373
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,600
staff power, the ritual staff bridge, but the spirit of fucking insane insane, they don't make sense.

374
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,560
It's like, I know it's, I know what you mean. And by the way, this guy called it in three or four

375
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:30,320
times with basically the same message. But, and I picked out what I thought was the best version of it.

376
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,400
I know. It feels really weird because you don't want to, it's like science fiction.

377
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,400
You read stuff. You're like, it's can't be true. It's on the internet. It probably isn't true.

378
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,280
But when you get guys like, uh,

379
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,600
Blorush, Blorush Pack.net, a Lush Pack.com, I think it is.

380
00:30:53,040 --> 00:31:00,080
Linden, Linden, Lorush, L-A-R-O-U-C-H-E, who's an economist who's been predicting all of this,

381
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:06,000
but this guy went really far. He's like, Barack Obama works for the British and he works for

382
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,400
the British and he's financed by George Soros and, uh, and Barack will never become president,

383
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:18,400
uh, and he really goes into very calm detail as to why. You know, that's another, and in fact,

384
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,600
I put that on curry.com just the other day. And I said required viewing. You have to check that one out.

385
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,480
All right. Let's move on with the, uh, with the phone calls coming in for this football

386
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,000
Friday, Disney, the Charlie.

387
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,520
Yeah, Adam, it's on the line, the episode, and then he mentioned an illustration podcast about

388
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Hurricane Katrina, uh, I mean, how they spent in various different things.

389
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,560
So I did notice, um, it's not really getting much widespread coverage.

390
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:52,240
Now, by the way, the truth or the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, let's call it facts or better fact,

391
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,080
are definitely be reported on everything I've been talking about, but

392
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,760
until it's been on the front page of every single newspaper,

393
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,320
until every single news magazine has done a piece on it. Within a certain period of time,

394
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,960
all close together, it just isn't news. There's too many sources. No longer is it that you get something

395
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:17,200
on CBS evening news, uh, prime time news is they used to call it on the Tiffany network. No longer

396
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,720
does that make it the truth. It has to be in all the papers. It has to be the buzzword of the day.

397
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:28,480
And it's very, very difficult with just one or two journalists and one or two editors

398
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,120
letting something slip through. But yes, um, things that are not widely reported doesn't mean that

399
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,720
they're not happening. Doesn't mean that they, I mean, look, people have to tow the corporate line.

400
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,000
It's real easy to, uh, to manipulate how a company works because every company is made up of people.

401
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,720
And those people in turn created DNA. And if DNA at the top is, hey, we don't talk about this,

402
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,240
then believe me, that filters down. You don't have to send any memo. Let's just how it works.

403
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,200
Let's see what you were talking about, though. Well, as you know, when they were busy doing all

404
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,320
loosening and all the pillaging and burning shit down, I think I got close to everything got really desperate.

405
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,800
Yes, I do. Well, if it's quite interesting, though, there was a few reports. We, uh, as soon as

406
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:13,440
they, uh, make up to the rich guess of the places where people are, notably rich in the law that

407
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,560
is around them. As soon as they had the right militias got to write areas, cops have gone through

408
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,560
out with everywhere. Yeah, I'm going to see you. Yeah, I'm going to see you.

409
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:26,240
I'm going to go for a cup of all I'm going to give you. So, uh, there's a bit, no going on that,

410
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,560
then initially makes the eye. And there was a lot of fucking suppression of,

411
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,880
basically people not were seriously needed help. And they just offered it to the rich.

412
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:41,360
And, uh, yeah, the thing is, though, got a couple of room. They don't have room for a long time,

413
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:47,040
I bet. Well, British Empire was built on. Take care. Really more out. Bye.

414
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,920
Yeah. Well, the British Empire is pretty evil as well. If you look at the, the history of it.

415
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,280
But, uh, oh, yeah, when Kanye West went on, it was Kanye West. Wasn't it who went on television

416
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:03,280
in the States and said George Bush hates black people? He was only half right. George Bush hates

417
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:09,040
black people and white people. He hates all, he hates all people who are poor. Absolutely.

418
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,640
It's good to see some savants checking in. Here we go.

419
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:24,320
Yo, yo, hey, hey, come on in. I had an initially prolific program out from San Francisco,

420
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:31,040
Antonio, went to Lexina. That looks like the EU. The Britain has ratified the Lisbon Treaty.

421
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:38,640
This is the Lentogas. Time to independent. And therefore, I assumed it. Correct. Um, that's all

422
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:43,760
Christmas. Yeah, that's pretty unfortunate. That, uh, that millionaire dude who was, uh, suing the

423
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:50,080
Labor Party for lying about holding a referendum. Um, unfortunately, he lost.

424
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,200
And, uh, there was something I want to tell you about the European Union. But, uh, crap.

425
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,200
I actually had to restart the mac and to have lost the link. Uh, former president of the EU.

426
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,920
I, like, I forget the guy's name. Uh, crap. I forget it. I'll do it on Monday. It was just amazing

427
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,600
something he said about the Lisbon Treaty, uh, which was actually published on the European

428
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:18,560
Parliament website. I got to find this link. Um, where he said, oh, you know, we just, uh, took the

429
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,680
original tree that was voted down by the Dutch and the French. And we shuffled the round broke it up into

430
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,840
all kinds of amendments and protocols and guidelines. And, uh, and that way, we avoided a, uh,

431
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:36,000
a referendum in any, in any other country. Except, of course, Ireland who very courageously voted

432
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,800
no. And, uh, it's, it's being shoved down their throats, my friends. You watch. It's really

433
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,560
important for these, uh, for these, you know, these people in power to get this thing, uh, pushed through.

434
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,440
Now, let me just say one thing about the Lisbon Treaty and the UK. The UK has a couple of exceptions.

435
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:00,880
The main one being that they say they do not, uh, accept the, um, the human rights portion of the

436
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:09,520
Lisbon Treaty. Oh, I was like, let me just get rid of that. Please. Um, so there's a whole, um,

437
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,400
uh, draft constitution for human rights. It's a part of the Lisbon Treaty. And the UK has a special,

438
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,640
uh, a special little deal in their contract. We actually a couple of them. One is, uh, they don't

439
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,520
have to adhere to that. So they can set their own laws. They don't have to be a part of, um, of the,

440
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,840
of the stuff that I find personally quite scary, you know, for instance, um, uh, there's no, there,

441
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,760
there, there, there, there is no death penalty in the European Union, except there are a couple

442
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,200
of exceptions. Uh, if you're killed while resisting arrest, uh, then that will not be deemed as any,

443
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,360
any legal kill. Uh, of course, the UK has all of their own initiatives and, uh, and plenty of it

444
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:54,400
going on. Um, but this is done because I, I believe that the, the UK actually, um, want to be

445
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,200
separate from the European Union and want, don't want to be a part of the demise of, uh, or

446
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,040
basically protect their own people on, uh, on the aisles from the demise that is coming. And a part

447
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,520
of that is also, of course, not actually using the euro while still being a part of the European

448
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:17,040
Union. And this goes back to that story about Soros, who, um, presumably, according to, uh, a linen

449
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,840
lorush. And you got to see this guy talk, um, people are trying to get a hold of me. That's the,

450
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,760
that's the E71 ringing, by the way. Nice little, uh, little, uh, voicemail message. Tone.

451
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,880
So according to Lyndon Lorush, uh, George Soros actually, oh, yeah, you know, when, uh, the story

452
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,160
that he almost broke the Bank of England, well, he was actually apparently working in conjunction

453
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:49,680
with the Bank of England to set England up to not be a part of the, uh, of the euro. And how that

454
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,560
exactly work, I don't know if I can clue. But I, you know, there's enough pieces on the board there

455
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,800
that I'll follow that trail and find out exactly how it worked. Um, so I think, uh, the UK is actually

456
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,160
trying to steer clear of a lot of the shit that they've now ratified into existence, which still shouldn't

457
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,920
make any difference because remember it has to be all 27 member states that ratified the treaty. And if one

458
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,120
of them isn't ratifying, then it should basically just go away. And we should continue under the

459
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,080
most strict treaty, or the niece treaty, I believe we're under right now. Uh, and that also, yeah,

460
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,800
who the hell knows? I don't understand how it works either. That's that's why we should get rid of it.

461
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,160
If we don't understand it, I, will you know you're being fucked somewhere?

462
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,640
Ah, all right. Let me, uh, let's switch over to something else. I got to give somebody some advice here.

463
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:46,160
Hi, Adam, my name is Raymond Hauss, a Central email, um, earlier today in regards to the mtv blog.com

464
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:53,280
The main name dispute I'm having, uh, with mtv, uh, the senior senior council has contacted me

465
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,760
in regards to swimming, if I don't, uh, turn over to domain. Um, um, and, uh,

466
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,560
read that you were in a similar position, uh, a few years ago, and I just wanted to get, uh,

467
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,560
I guess this year, um, feedback or comments, I'm sure, right, busy. Um, but if you did have a minute,

468
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,520
um, that would be great. I'm going to buy back to my email. All right. So, uh, let me help you out here,

469
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:22,000
buddy. Um, that was a very different circumstance, uh, 15 years ago. I think it was 93, 90, yeah, 93.

470
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,680
And I had actually read just at mtv.com with their permission. Um, now, when I quit,

471
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,480
they then immediately sued me for that name. And if they'd asked for it, the idiots, I would have given

472
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,560
it to them. Just ask that I could keep Adam at mtv.com as an email address, but, uh, that didn't work.

473
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,720
So, uh, they went to court and uh, and I counter sued, uh, because, uh, you know, because they were trying

474
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,280
to strong army and we had certain agreements. Now, of course, we said a lot of court and I'm not

475
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,560
allowed to talk about that anymore. But the, the way they, the procedure they took, which was pretty

476
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,080
fair, you know, all things considered, uh, was, uh, the land amact, which means, uh, consumers could

477
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:11,440
be confused when they show up at mtv.com. And they see, like an mtv guy, even if he's an xmtv guy,

478
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm talking about music entertainment, that could be perceived as confusing. So, of course,

479
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,280
they were right on that. It's just the whole, the way they went about it and the agreements we

480
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,600
had made is where they messed up. And I was able to take it to a press and kind of a David Goliath

481
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,880
type of way, which didn't suit them at all. Now, if you register mtv blog.com, you can understand

482
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,280
that they're going to do the exact same thing. And it's, it can be deemed confusing to consumers.

483
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:42,320
So, uh, forget about it. Just give it up. You know, uh, maybe a register mtv blog.com,

484
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:49,440
mpty, something like that. Vee. I don't know. Just forgive it up because they'll suck your

485
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:58,880
dry and they'll, uh, you just don't want to do it. Please. Oh, boy, I'm only halfway through the list.

486
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,000
Are you still with me? Uh, just a quick plug for rally for the Republic. We're going to get

487
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,320
together with a whole bunch of, uh, whole bunch of folks out in, um, Minneapolis. Parallel convention

488
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:16,800
to the Republican convention taking place. This is a Dr. Ron Paul's initiative. There's two dates.

489
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,800
There's September 1st and September 2nd. September 2nd is going to be the big who how blow out

490
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,560
in the stadium 15,000 plus people. Uh, but the day before, we're going to have a, we're going to

491
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,040
rock out in some football, uh, on some football field. I'm not quite sure of the details. But if you

492
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,560
go to rally for the Republic.com, uh, that's where you find out all the information tickets are on sale.

493
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,960
Uh, I think it's like $17 and 76 cents, you know, all kind of cool, cool numerology happening.

494
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,760
And I think you'll find a lot of like-minded people there if you happen to be in the neighborhood.

495
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,920
I'm certainly going to be there and I'm looking forward to meeting all kinds of new people and

496
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,840
maybe some, uh, some folks who, uh, um, it will listen to the Charlie. All right. Let's hear

497
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,040
someone happy. Happy, I said. I'm pulled by Johnny from New York. Check it out. And it pulls

498
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:09,680
out Johnny. Two months and 2000 miles driving the grease car and loving every fucking free

499
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,040
mile of it. Hell yeah. It's not for everybody who said that before. But, uh, just regarding

500
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,400
you're tracking the price of oil, don't be so, uh, don't, don't get all happy when it drops

501
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,800
20 dollars of barrel. Because this is what happens. And it's happening in the past.

502
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,600
First of all, the gas and maybe you'll go down a little bit, you know, let's just take

503
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:35,120
those down to $4 a gallon. You know what that is? That's the government's way of making us just

504
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:41,600
we feel good all of sudden because it went from $450 to $4 and they did that for us. That's bullshit.

505
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,960
It's never going to go down below four. It's only going to go up and we'll continue to take it in the

506
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,760
forever. You know, I, I got to agree with you there. Although it has dipped a little bit before

507
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:57,040
below $4, but yeah, I think you're right. That'll totally agree with. And particularly

508
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,720
looking at these profits that we're just announced today. Yeah, absolutely. They're controlling

509
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,320
that price. And yes, you're right. Ain't no probage. You will continue. So, everyone please choose

510
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:12,400
your own pill in your own way to fix this thing. You know, mine was a grease car. Somebody else might

511
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,920
be a previous or some other kind of hybrid. Somebody might buy a bicycle, but just do something

512
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,800
for fuck sake. Those are Johnny checking out. Anybody want to know about grease cars, check it out

513
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,400
at the greasebens.wordpress.com. Oh, bulls and John. All right, man. Thank you.

514
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,000
Yeah. So, I'm doing, I'm doing my own thing. I'm testing out these, uh, this hydroxy stuff with

515
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,840
the hydroxy booster. By the way, I won't have time today because and I'm going to do a separate show

516
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,080
on it. Chris from Levittown called in with about, you know, he did two times three minutes on the

517
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,360
voicemail. An excellent, excellent analysis of the hydroxy booster, which by the way, he says,

518
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:52,160
will not work. But I really like that comment. And as I said, I'm going to roll that out for

519
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:59,360
your next week on a chuckle on a chuckle. There we go. We've got a new one. Um, because he really

520
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,360
explains how the thing works, even though he says it doesn't work. And let me just say this,

521
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:09,360
um, based upon the feedback that I'm getting. Look, there's a couple of things about this hydroxy

522
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,800
booster. All right. If you don't know what I'm talking about, just Google it hydroxy booster. I've

523
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:19,600
got one installed on, uh, on the jack and it works. Uh, if I don't go faster than 110 kilometers per hour,

524
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:26,880
I've already seen 29% efficiency in my gas usage. And that's just less gas I have to put in.

525
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:33,120
Now, this could be a combination of things. One, it could be because of all of the tinkering and adding

526
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,000
new fuel source that the onboard computer has actually gotten a little more efficient. That's very

527
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,040
possible. They usually set these things to be efficient for emissions and not necessarily for

528
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:49,280
how efficient you can be on your engine. Um, and of course, that I using hydrogen or a version of

529
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,880
that being injected in. So it could be that the computer chip is adjusted itself. Um, again, I'm not

530
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,440
not, I'm not getting the data off of the computer chip. I'm looking at how after X amount of kilometers,

531
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,520
I'm seeing how much fuel I have to put into a full tank. That's the simplest way to do it

532
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:10,960
it's the way I do it in aviation. I, you know, my life depends on it. So that's one. Um, it could

533
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,440
also be that I'm more conscious of how I'm driving and maybe I'm driving in a, uh, a less wasteful

534
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:23,120
manner, very, very possible. It could be completely, uh, unconscious. It could be happening in my

535
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:29,200
subconscious. I don't think so, but it's possible. Then there's another option. Shit could actually

536
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,920
work. I've seen a lot of energy going into how many amps, the booster pulls, how much, uh,

537
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:42,080
hydroxy gas is created, how many liters per minute. It could actually just work. It's a thread

538
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:47,760
will stay on here. Okay, I promise you. Uh, hold on a second. This next one. Um,

539
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,520
yeah, what the hell is Charles? It's Charles a drunken lunter. Even though it's, it's a little

540
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,720
off topic. Let me bring him in for a second. Adam's, Charles, you know what I'm saying?

541
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,560
I completely, if I go, I was going to tell it. Anyway, um, I'm on your way, which is where

542
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:12,240
young man called Benville, dad, and killed recently. I've, um, uh, one of my, coming through, uh,

543
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:19,840
London, I often walk places about five miles, five and up miles, and my home to the very

544
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,160
centre of the boat, where I do Charles is talking on his iPhone and needs a little work on

545
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,120
the acoustic sound when walking down the street. Oh, my word. Oh yeah, I remember I was saying

546
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,040
I was going to be there. So what do you like, home to the 3G? Yeah. You know, it's all right,

547
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,960
half the ball. No great. But, um, what I would really like to see is that the contract,

548
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,840
my GPS movement, so I can see how far I've walked. We'll also be useful for people who know

549
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,800
about it, talking, um, you know, of an app like this. Would you put the word out? Someone

550
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,920
to make an app like this? Oh, just basically instead of tracking, instead of, you know,

551
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,920
me following a route, it will show me the route. I'll, uh, I'll also just enjoy the fact that

552
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:11,680
I can then do really big pictures. I, you know, I walk in places, I can try and draw or shape

553
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,240
uh, make it and sell out my name across London. You don't mean something like that. Anyway,

554
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:26,400
if you're ready. Oh, man, Charles. Okay. So what Kurt Charles got his iPhone 3G,

555
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:33,040
he says it's all right. And boy, I cannot tell you how happy I am. I chose for the Nokia E71.

556
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:38,000
I'm so happy with that choice. I really, really am. Because here's what I discovered the other

557
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,160
day. I'm a big drive off to, uh, off to Europe. I use something called Wayfinder. And I like Wayfinder

558
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:50,080
as a GPS device because you can load it onto your Nokia phone. Uh, by the way, the E71,

559
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:55,680
this, the, the, the, the GPS chips. Man, they come the life so quick. I mean, I, I was going through

560
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,560
tunnels. It would like boom within two seconds of coming out of the tunnel. I've got my GPS

561
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:07,120
fix in, uh, fantastic. So I use Wayfinder, which is an online service. And what I like about it is you

562
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:12,320
don't actually have to download any maps. What it does is it downloads maps on the go as you need them.

563
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,880
But it has another feature built into it. This wayfinder. And I think it's only, I think it does

564
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,440
Windows mobile as well, but certainly Nokia phones. You can track it. So because it's already

565
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,760
downloading maps, it knows how to get online and knows how to talk to home base to the server.

566
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:33,120
But you can also have it track your movement. And every, um, I think it's based on time,

567
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,880
not necessarily on, well, maybe it may be this based on distance. I have to find out, uh,

568
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:43,120
exactly how it's configured. But, uh, I tried it for this trip. You said on, you said a little,

569
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:49,120
uh, preference that says turn on a Google Earth tracking. And when I got home loan, behold, I went

570
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:56,320
to my wayfinder.com. And, uh, there were some, uh, KML files sitting for me. And I double clicked them

571
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:01,920
and opened up, opened up Google Earth. And there was my entire trips set with intervals. I believe

572
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,560
if it's not that way, it should be something you could set. Um, so I could actually see the software

573
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,720
from time to time saying, hey, I need to connect to the network may I connect. You can make it

574
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,800
connect automatically. But I kind of like knowing when it's connecting, particularly on the road,

575
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,480
when I'm roaming, because that could be pretty devastating, uh, it cost-wise. But every single time

576
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,480
it wants to connect, this basically sending a little ping back to the server and adding an entry

577
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,520
into this KML file. So you could easily take a picture at the same time and you could go back later

578
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,960
and synchronize that. Um, so it exists already. Uh, is there an app for the iPhone that does that?

579
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,640
I doubt it. Again, a reason why I'm really, really happy. And I'm an Apple lover, not a fighter,

580
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:54,560
but still very happy. I chose for the E71.com extra.com extra.com extra.com extra.com extra.com extra.com extra.com extra.

581
00:49:54,560 --> 00:50:04,800
Time once again for news from our EU correspondent, CSB, take it away. Hello, Adam, I'm on free.

582
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:11,520
Okay. So your opinion is considering to impose visas on citizens of USA,

583
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:19,680
where visiting Europe, because USA is fucking up. The Russians in the visa free movement in

584
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:25,680
very, very serious. So for example, introducing USA is from January 2009,

585
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:31,920
a requirement to register three days before departure to USA, killing last minute flights.

586
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,840
Oh, dude, tell me about it. I know there were a whole bunch of people who were leaving

587
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,640
people airport in Amsterdam to go to the states and they had their kids,

588
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,640
listed on one of the parents' passports. And a lot of them, like thousands,

589
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,560
has said, you know, you can't fly because you will not be able to enter the United States unless

590
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:55,280
your kid has their own passport. So you can't get a visa like on a Sunday if you're flying out.

591
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,640
You can't usually can't get a visa over immediately on the spot anyway. So a lot of people

592
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:08,160
couldn't, and I apologize as an American citizen. I apologize for this idiocy. I really do. Oh, man.

593
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:18,400
Yes. So now the table is being turned, and I guess all diplomats have to get a visa to come to

594
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:25,280
Europe. It isn't nuts. Are we crazy in this way? And you say it's using divide and conquer by

595
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,680
not granting visa waiver to all EU countries. So you say it's also a piece of that's a

596
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:39,040
Poland EU member said we don't feel any danger from Iran and rejected the demands of your

597
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:45,440
state, locating to several rockets there. So as you see, not always well in USA, EU relations.

598
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:53,600
Yeah, that's for sure, man. And I'm trying to understand something else. The federal reserve apparently

599
00:51:53,600 --> 00:52:00,960
has a line of credit with the European Central Bank. So now Europe is guaranteeing money for,

600
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:07,120
I guess indirectly, for banks that have just been going crazy and are failing. And they recently

601
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:14,000
up that amount from 50 billion to 55 billion dollars. I'm not quite sure why the 10% increase.

602
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,000
I'm thinking maybe it has something to do with how interest rates are determined. That was some

603
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,480
kind of settlement for something, but I'm just not quite sure what it is yet. Oh, boy, boy. How

604
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,480
I yearn for some economics of honest.

605
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:35,280
Casting from the biggest climate in the world. From London's L's court, it's the great British

606
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:43,280
beer festival beer cast with 350,000 points of beer, cider and perion offer. There's only one man

607
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:51,040
for the job. Mark Fitts. Hi, Adam, the 2008 Great British beer festival starts on Tuesday,

608
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:58,080
the fifth August and once again, RB presenting the GBBF beer cast from the show. The show runs

609
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:04,320
until Saturday, the 10th and RB going behind the scenes, talking to some of the 2000 volunteers

610
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:09,600
that set up and run the festival. We'll be checking out the champion beer written competition,

611
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:15,280
finding out how the campaign for real oil is getting on in the midst of an economic downturn.

612
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,280
And we'll be visiting some of the more unusual areas, like the children's playroom,

613
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,120
because parents are encouraged to bring their kids along too, which is good laugh,

614
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:28,160
and I'll be tasting a beer or two. If you're going to be at home, we're not jumping

615
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:33,440
the train from G-town to London, catch the two to old's court, and let me treat you to a beer

616
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:40,320
or two. It'll be sort of big hair meets large amounts of liquid refreshments. Anyway, to catch the

617
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:47,200
beer cast and hear last year's editions, head to beercast.btpodshow.com. And remember, I've got a

618
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:53,440
print glass here with your name on it, so come pick it up. Cheers and fulver.

619
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:59,280

621
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:20,320
You know, you're just no matter what you say, you just can't be free beer.

622
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,320
I'll do my darkness, my friend. I got a small upcoming travel, but it'll be great to hang out with you.

623
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:59,280
I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to

624
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:29,280
be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free,

625
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:59,280
I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free,

626
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:29,280
I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm going to be free, I'm

627
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,880
I'll be passing, if thanks for all the eggs

628
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,680
And the drums and the nannies and the guns

629
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,080
And the bombs on the kites

630
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,680
Thanks for all the eggs

631
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,480
And the floods and the floods and the drugs

632
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,880
And the ban and all the lights

633
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,480
Thanks for all the eggs

634
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,680
And the eyes and flu

635
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,680
I'm for you, I'm for making our slaves

636
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,480
Thanks for all the eggs

637
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,680
I'll pray for me, my fitness

638
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,080
Cause I've hit a ratchet

639
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,280
Come in, I'd share, like clear patcher

640
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,480
How you can have a capture

641
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,680
The dawn of it's stature

642
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,880
I'm even under my light

643
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,480
My grid, that jerk

644
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,680
Where'd you look, bombs like a nickel true

645
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,280
And then the gas blew up the coordinates

646
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,280
And my man, look

647
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,280
As I see, the sky got once to kill you

648
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,280
If you're queer, I'll review it to you

649
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,880
And I'm mine, I ran a hole

650
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,080
I ran, if you were a dog

651
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,280
Because you haven't got a soul

652
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,280
I ran, if you were a dead baby

653
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,680
You should count your stuns

654
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,880
And see, I'll lock you up

655
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,080
So if you kids run, let it end you up

656
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,680
So I'm time's rest

657
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,680
And the worst cracker

658
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,080
I can say this, cause I'm sure

659
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,880
You ain't shit, we've been advised

660
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,480
Quimbed, we have like a depressed

661
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,480
When we say thanks for all the ice

662
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,480
And the bombs in the guns and the arms

663
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,680
And the bombs on the crimes

664
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,280
Thanks for all the ice

665
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,080
And the lies in the wives and the guys

666
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,480
Who be dying, it's tight

667
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,080
Thanks for all the ice

668
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,680
And the creativity, and for me

669
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,280
I'm bringing on a break

670
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,280
Thanks for all the ice

671
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,080
One, no, fuck it, time

672
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,480
Thanks for all the ice

673
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,680
And the bombs in the guns and the guns

674
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,880
And the bomb is on the ice

675
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,280
And the lights are all the ice

676
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,680
And the floods and the bloods

677
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,480
And the drugs in the ban and all the fights

678
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,280
Thanks for all the ice

679
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,680
And the lies in the wives and the wives

680
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,480
And the mic and the sights

681
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,280
Thanks for all the ice

682
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,680
Ever since I played Akira the Don's

683
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,680
The Banks are song

684
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,880
The Banks is against us

685
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,680
Play that uh

686
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,280
We could two ago

687
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,280
Have had a nice little email chat with him

688
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,880
And they said dude, you might want to check out this song

689
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,880
Which

690
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,880
The hell is that?

691
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,280
It's on the track

692
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,280
Let's listen

693
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,480
Let's hear the boy

694
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,480
You can do it all boy

695
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,680
You're the one that bad

696
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,680
You won't step out of the threshold

697
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,880
Because you're a skier

698
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,880
That's freaky

699
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,480
That is really freaky

700
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,680
He said

701
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,880
I think it was on the

702
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,080
Maybe it was in her scope record

703
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,280
I think he said he uh

704
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,880
He played this track for Jimmy Ioveen

705
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,880
Who then freaked out and kicked him off the label

706
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,480
Thanks for all the aids

707
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,280
Yeah

708
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,280
The UK is pretty interesting these days

709
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,080
There was a piece on

710
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,680
It was kind of like a cops show on the

711
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,320
I think it was channel 4

712
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,880
It was ITV channel 4 ITV the other day

713
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,680
It was one of the commercial stations

714
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,680
And it was about drug dogs

715
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,880
And they had these

716
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,680
This is amazing what's going on here

717
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,280
So if you're on the on the subway

718
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,680
Which they call the tube here

719
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,280
In the UK

720
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,480
And so when you come out of the underground

721
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,480
You go up the subway

722
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,280
You go up an escalator

723
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,480
Then to the basic platinum to the station

724
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,280
Right from the platform you write up

725
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,480
And they've got these drug dogs there

726
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,480
And they sniff everybody as they walk by

727
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,280
Now remember this is a subway in London

728
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,480
Okay

729
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,080
And these drug dogs will stand

730
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,280
And they sniff if they smell anything

731
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,680
Then you get pulled aside

732
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,280
And they get a citation

733
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,480
Or we certainly get questions and searched

734
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,080
Because I saw that

735
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,480
And what was amazing to me

736
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,280
Is that these were people who had like a little baggy

737
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,680
of something on them

738
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,080
Just like the minuscule amounts

739
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,680
And at one point this dog is neat

740
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,680
And if you know anything about a tube station

741
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,480
The UK you understand the distance here

742
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,080
So these dogs are right

743
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,080
At where you come off the escalator

744
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,280
And also this dog is like freaking out

745
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,880
And he's trying to find something

746
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,080
And the dog goes

747
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:24,080
Pass the exit doors outside

748
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,680
On to a part

749
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,480
Was a grading outside

750
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,080
This must have been like 100 feet away at least

751
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,680
And finds a little roach

752
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,680
That had just been put out by someone

753
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,480
That's how sensitive their noses are

754
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,280
And there was also some alluding to

755
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,880
Bees being used you know

756
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,880
Bees as in honey bees

757
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,280
That they're now being trained to find

758
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,480
Just sniff out marijuana and hasheesh

759
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,080
Yeah that'll stop you

760
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,480
If you get a whole bunch of bees circling around your head

761
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,480
Anyway

762
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,880
Thanks for all the aids

763
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,480
Man, talk about some political stuff on the chalk

764
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,280
Huh?

765
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,880
Let's do something else here

766
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,480
And I'm just checking if there's not what side of shiitown

767
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,280
No you'll chuck it

768
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,080
You'll be here you're back from your vague chain

769
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,280
The song I was for

770
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,280
Songs yes

771
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,280
Nice

772
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,080
That's great

773
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,880
Hey let's say just want to say really quick

774
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,680
Listen to your show today and I loved the commentary

775
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,680
You played at CNBC and then you pause it

776
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,880
And then you say what they really mean

777
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,880
That is brilliant

778
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:28,880
Look at man brilliant

779
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,880
Keep it up

780
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,280
I'm old school here

781
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,880
So we love that

782
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,880
Need it great

783
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,880
I hope you win

784
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,880
And that worked for us

785
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,880
And they worked for us

786
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,680
And I'm wide awake and dreamland

787
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,880
We could add that one as well

788
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,880
Either Adam C Curry

789
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,880
Don't be seen then

790
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,880
You know, it's Mark Sinkle

791
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,880
And a while back of your members

792
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,880
He's really Adam

793
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:54,880
I think he's had one

794
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,880
He's showing something

795
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,880
Sounds like he's on an eye

796
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,880
Followed 3G

797
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,880
Cut now

798
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,880
Holy herb is cooking to your head

799
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,880
Oh yeah

800
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,880
And all ideas like UFOs and things like that

801
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,880
Now I'd better if you were to ask

802
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,880
You're listening to how many of them have seen UFO

803
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,880
I think you get a pretty big response of people saying

804
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,880
Yeah, it's not something a little weird

805
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,880
Like I certainly have seen something weird

806
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,880
I don't know if you'd call it UFO

807
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,880
I don't know if you'd call it

808
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,880
I don't know what you would call it

809
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,880
But anyways

810
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,880
They work for us not be aliens

811
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,880
But you know what I mean

812
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:32,880
All right

813
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:33,880
Love you normal but bye

814
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,880
Well, they may be two sides of the same coin

815
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,880
I don't know

816
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,880
Yeah, it's a good idea

817
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,880
All right, let's find out how many chuckle heads

818
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,880
have seen something they found to be

819
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,880
Strange supernatural or unexplained

820
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,880
Oh, I'm done with that

821
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,880
By the way, another astronaut came out

822
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,880
Today saying that he's supporting the other astronaut

823
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,880
The guy who was the six-man to walk on the moon

824
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,880
That he too saw aliens

825
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,880
And they were in discussion with astronauts

826
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,880
What the hell is going on

827
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,880
Now granted these guys are all 70, 80 years old

828
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,880
But they don't seem like fools to me

829
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,880
You know, there's still that theory going around

830
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,880
That we may be in for a good old fashioned

831
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:14,880
Scared from the aliens that would be essentially a false flag operation

832
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,880
Who the hell knows?

833
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,880
I'll just believe the dollar is actually going to do a great

834
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:20,880
Disappearing act

835
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,880
That one I'm done with all the other stuff

836
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,880
Wouldn't surprise me if it happened

837
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,880
Not laying awake about it though

838
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,880
Surprising amount of response that came in

839
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,880
Through my quest for answers

840
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:35,880
No one is in the DSC audience

841
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,880
As far as I can tell, let's purchase one of these great

842
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,880
Drobot units

843
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,880
If you go to DrobotStore.com

844
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,880
And you use the DSC code you get fifty dollars off

845
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,880
The purchase now it's a high ticket item

846
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,880
But I've got a lot of great response of people saying

847
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,880
Why they will or will not purchase it

848
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,880
And I want to share two of them with you right now

849
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,880
Okay Adam

850
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,880
With from Silicon Valley

851
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,880
Just catching up on your latest podcast

852
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,880
You asked

853
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,880
I think it was Monday about

854
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,880
Drobot and has anyone bought one

855
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,880
I bought the Robo

856
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,880
Storch unit

857
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,880
The day they announced it in

858
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,880
I bought the Robo share

859
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,880
The day they announced that

860
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:18,880
My assessment is

861
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,880
Well let me just say that

862
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,880
Drobot is like an endless hard drive

863
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,880
It's kind of like a like a disc array or a raid

864
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,880
So it's really safe and even if one of the drives

865
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,880
Crashes you don't lose all your data

866
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,880
You can keep upgrading it with bigger and bigger

867
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,880
Pretty much standard hard drives as far as I understand

868
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,880
Which I think it's just a miracle concept

869
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,880
Now I don't need terabytes of data

870
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,880
Just yet

871
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,880
But for someone using Photoshop or really big music production

872
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,880
I can see where you would need that kind of capability

873
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,880
Is direct attached to Mac or

874
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,880
Windows

875
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,880
They work very well as as a pseudo raid storage device

876
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,880
Much better than raid

877
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,880
Because you can mix and match different size discs

878
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,880
And it's all you know itty approved

879
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,880
Very disappointed with the Robo share

880
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,880
From a Mac

881
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,880
Network perspective

882
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,880
I've had very bad performance

883
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,880
Work with their tech support folks

884
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,880
And they really have not addressed

885
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,880
You know performance problems

886
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,880
So if your users are Mac based and they want the network support

887
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,880
I'd be cautious if you want to direct attach it

888
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,880
Or your Windows only it's probably pretty good

889
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,880
But just announced the new version that has

890
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,880
Firewire 800 for direct attach

891
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,880
And slightly faster processor

892
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,880
And a more quiet fan

893
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,880
So that's probably worth taking a look at also

894
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,880
Anyway, that's my two cents

895
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,880
Thank you very much

896
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,880
I appreciate that so if they have a new version out

897
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,880
Has anyone tried that one yet?

898
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,880
Is the Mac Network support now better?

899
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,880
Because that's pretty critical to know

900
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,880
So I appreciate that report

901
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,880
And I'll also talk to HQ and ask them if they've been more reports

902
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,880
About the network support not being up to par

903
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,880
But it sounds like it's great on Windows

904
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,880
Great with direct connect

905
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,880
Not great for Mac with network support

906
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,880
Now along with that California Dave

907
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,880
Who will become a future president of the United States

908
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,880
Which really sent me off on kind of an emotional spin

909
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,880
This next call also freaked me out

910
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,880
And I didn't hear them in the order that you're hearing now

911
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,880
Beginning of the hour and then you know an hour later

912
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,880
I heard them pretty close together

913
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,880
Because that's how phone calls come in

914
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,880
But this one really sucked

915
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,880
Really really sucked

916
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,880
I'm a Christian Nashville

917
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,880
Listening to DSC 7th set of six

918
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,880
You have to question why no one bought the drill bone

919
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,880
Of course I would love to have one

920
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,880
Perhaps absolutely to have one

921
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,880
Except you know just like a lot of us

922
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,880
I think you know the money crunch

923
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,880
You know or just kind of expect

924
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,880
Kind of expensive right now

925
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,880
I am looking into some

926
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,880
You know storage alternatives

927
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,880
And the drill will be nice

928
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,880
And nice thing that I would love to have

929
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,880
But you know just fill in the pinch

930
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,880
I'm a money thing

931
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,880
Just I let you know

932
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:26,880
Bye

933
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,880
So that sucks

934
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,880
That really hurt me just I could hear it

935
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,880
And that's the economy we're in

936
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:34,880
And that's where we're headed

937
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,880
And people got a buy food

938
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:37,880
As long as there is food

939
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,880
There is a shortage on you know

940
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,880
There are some countries that don't actually have fucking food

941
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,880
So I keep telling my daughter

942
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,880
Can you imagine tomorrow they'd be like

943
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,880
No bread and no milk

944
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:48,880
Yeah that was suck

945
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,880
Yeah but I mean how much would it really suck if it didn't come back

946
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,880
You know

947
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,880
All right

948
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,880
I had a McDonald's from Chicago

949
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:58,880
Hey man

950
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,880
I was calling regarding

951
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,880
The

952
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,880
No Kia E71

953
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,880
You mentioned using that product

954
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,880
Do you essentially create a Wi-Fi

955
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,880
Hotspots that you can browse the web

956
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,880
Yeah

957
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,880
You're an iPod touch

958
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,880
I was just wondering why you would use the iPod touch

959
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,880
So that the Nokia N810

960
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,880
Let us know

961
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,880
Okay

962
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:22,880
Yeah

963
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:23,880
35 male

964
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:24,880
Scruncher

965
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:25,880
Fred Till

966
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,880
Say Work for us

967
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:28,880
Helia

968
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:29,880
All right

969
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:30,880
And wide awake and dreamland

970
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,880
Let me tell you why

971
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:33,880
Because without a doubt

972
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,880
The iPod touch of the iPhone

973
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:37,880
It's the same thing

974
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:38,880
The browser

975
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,880
The Safari browser is very superior

976
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,880
Particularly with the screen real estate

977
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:44,880
You get to use

978
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,880
And I really use it in three cases

979
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,880
For a quick Gmail

980
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:50,880
Because I just love the web

981
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,880
I mean on the E71

982
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,880
I can get a mobile version of Gmail

983
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:55,880
But it's nothing like the mobile

984
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,880
Safari version of Gmail

985
01:08:58,880 --> 01:08:59,880
I mean that's it's beautiful

986
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:00,880
I wish they would do it

987
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,880
an E71 specific version for Gmail

988
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:04,880
So it's really really beautiful

989
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:05,880
The way it works

990
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,880
And it also is autocomplete

991
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,880
Autocomplete

992
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,880
Excuse me

993
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,880
Autocomplete if your email addresses

994
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,880
Right there in the Safari browser

995
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:15,880
Can't beat it

996
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:16,880
So when I really want to

997
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,880
You know, scan some email on the go

998
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,880
And I really want to be able to respond

999
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,880
Not just a quick brief little look at something

1000
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,880
Then I'll use that

1001
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:24,880
Same goes for Google reader

1002
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,880
They have a fantastic Safari mobile version

1003
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,880
It's just beautiful

1004
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,880
You know, with stuff expanding in place

1005
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:32,880
And it's just so fast

1006
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,880
It really saved you so much time

1007
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,880
As the same goes for Google

1008
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,880
News

1009
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,880
That mobile version on Safari

1010
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,880
It's also superior to the regular mobile

1011
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,880
Mobile version

1012
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,880
So that's why I use it

1013
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,880
And it's really worth it to me

1014
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,880
To carry this really small iPod touch around

1015
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,880
For those minutes when I need it

1016
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:50,880
Now of course, most of the time

1017
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,880
I'm just using the E71 for everything

1018
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,880
And even use the email client

1019
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,880
Connected to Gmail

1020
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:57,880
I map and it works great

1021
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,880
But at the end of the day

1022
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,880
If you use the Opera Mini browser

1023
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:02,880
Which is fantastic

1024
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,880
It's fast

1025
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,880
It's fast

1026
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,880
I use that for any other website

1027
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,880
Except for those

1028
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,880
Gmail Safari specifically

1029
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,880
Enhanced sites

1030
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:13,880
Hey, I'm getting to the end of the show

1031
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:14,880
Here hanging with me

1032
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,880
Because we've got a couple more cool things coming up

1033
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,880
Yo, Mr. Curry

1034
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,880
I'm John from the Duke

1035
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,880
Long time listener

1036
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,880
A fan of the DSC and no agenda

1037
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:25,880
Thanks to your work

1038
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:26,880
It's awesome

1039
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,880
The Vorac is not

1040
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:29,880
I love them though

1041
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:30,880
Anyway

1042
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,880
The calling to see if you heard that Glenn Beck has been using the phrase

1043
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,880
It's a tablework for us lately

1044
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,880
Maybe Glenn Beck is a fan of your show

1045
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,880
Anyways, I love the show

1046
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:41,880
And

1047
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,880
Wish I took the blue pill

1048
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,880
Scrunchers, run folder, great here

1049
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,880
You already won

1050
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,880
Love you me in no homo

1051
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,880
And they work for us

1052
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:51,880
Yeah

1053
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:52,880
Absolutely

1054
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,880
Well, first of all, the only correct thing to say here is

1055
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,880
I'm happy

1056
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:57,880
Shit, yeah

1057
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,880
This is the word that needs to get out

1058
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,880
I think Ron Paul was actually on Glenn Beck the other day

1059
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,880
And Glenn Beck seems like he's awakening

1060
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:06,880
He's a little bit behind

1061
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:07,880
But he's getting there

1062
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,880
So the more people that use the phrase

1063
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:11,880
They work for us

1064
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:12,880
The better

1065
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,880
I don't care who comes up with it

1066
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,880
Of course, what you will get

1067
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,880
And it's just the way media works

1068
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,880
If we just highlight that for a second

1069
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,880
Of course, people say

1070
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,880
Oh man, you're so lame

1071
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,880
Glenn Beck has been doing this for years

1072
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,880
And again, all I'll say is

1073
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,880
I really don't give a shit

1074
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,880
I'm so happy that more people are picking this up

1075
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,880
They do work for us

1076
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,880
Dammit, they work for us

1077
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:31,880
And if we all wake up

1078
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,880
And we start talking this way

1079
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,880
We can change things

1080
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,880
We really can

1081
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,880
Because the people who really own us

1082
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,880
The people who really own the countries

1083
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:41,880
The people who own the unions

1084
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,880
The people who own the money

1085
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:44,880
And the way the money is printed

1086
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:45,880
And manipulated

1087
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,880
They'll never come out of the shadows

1088
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,880
They'll continue their plan

1089
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:50,880
And they'll continue to try

1090
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,880
But they only have certain control

1091
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,880
They only have control over people

1092
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,880
With money

1093
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,880
And we have control over

1094
01:11:58,880 --> 01:11:59,880
Who actually

1095
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,880
Does anything in government

1096
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,880
It is completely within our grasp

1097
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:04,880
And if we're just all awake

1098
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:05,880
And we're standing there awake

1099
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,880
Then these guys and gals

1100
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,880
They won't be able to do anything

1101
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:10,880
But what we tell them to

1102
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,880
Because they work for us

1103
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:13,880
And of story

1104
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:14,880
Hey, I don't know

1105
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:15,880
This turns

1106
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,880
I was just going from Texas

1107
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:18,880
And that's the state

1108
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:19,880
That T-Boom

1109
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,880
Pickens is from

1110
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:21,880
Yeah, you know

1111
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:22,880
I've heard a lot of

1112
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,880
A lot of people have been sending me messages

1113
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:24,880
About T-Boom pickens

1114
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,880
And I've not paid attention to

1115
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:27,880
Of course not having been in the

1116
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,880
States for a while

1117
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:29,880
I haven't seen any of the commercials

1118
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,880
That I keep hearing people refer

1119
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:32,880
To

1120
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:33,880
And I'm not quite sure

1121
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:34,880
I don't have an opinion on the guy yet

1122
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:35,880
But he's definitely

1123
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:36,880
Wait, first of all

1124
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:37,880
Guys got a cool name

1125
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,880
Nothing wrong with the name

1126
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,880
Like T-Boom

1127
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,880
That rocks

1128
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,880
He has proposed his new energy plan

1129
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,880
For building wind centers in Texas

1130
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,880
In order to power the electricity

1131
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,880
Here and there around

1132
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,880
This around the area

1133
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,880
He's saying that it'll cost up

1134
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,880
From $7 to $10 billion

1135
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:58,880
Which is of course

1136
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,880
Is peanuts these days

1137
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,880
And I guess the main reason

1138
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,880
He's doing that

1139
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,880
Because he's saying that

1140
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,880
Well, I guess the statistics

1141
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:07,880
Is that $7 billion

1142
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,880
That $700 billion

1143
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:10,880
It's spent

1144
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,880
On that note

1145
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,880
We can take the profits from

1146
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,880
Shell oil alone

1147
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:19,880
For one quarter

1148
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,880
They could take their profits

1149
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:22,880
They could invest

1150
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,880
In his plan

1151
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:25,880
If it's for real

1152
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:26,880
And I'll take that

1153
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:27,880
There's a new report

1154
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,880
To MIT is figured out

1155
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,880
Some way to store solar energy

1156
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:32,880
Much more efficiently

1157
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,880
I'm starting to believe this is a real

1158
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:35,880
Viable alternative

1159
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,880
And it seems like there's

1160
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:38,880
Enough companies and corporations

1161
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:39,880
Out there

1162
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:40,880
Or enough money floating around

1163
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,880
Dollars or euros

1164
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,880
While it lasts

1165
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,880
While stocks last

1166
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,880
To get this funded

1167
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:48,880
To Tom's pay

1168
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:49,880
I'm not a guy

1169
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:50,880
I don't know how many windmills

1170
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,880
It means

1171
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:52,880
I don't know if it means that Texas

1172
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,880
Will be the known as the windmills state

1173
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,880
But

1174
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,880
In tough times

1175
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,880
You've got to make tough decisions

1176
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:01,880
Environment

1177
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,880
That we pretty much

1178
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:03,880
I mean you kind of wonder

1179
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:04,880
How much is that

1180
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,880
It's just to protect the places

1181
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:07,880
That we get the oil from

1182
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,880
But I'm kind of curious

1183
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:11,880
Know what people are

1184
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,880
So against the officer

1185
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,880
We're dealing

1186
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:14,880
It's because of pollution

1187
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:15,880
Or

1188
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,880
Now I think the people are against

1189
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:18,880
The offshore drilling

1190
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:19,880
Because of

1191
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:20,880
Mainly this has always been Florida

1192
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,880
Because it ruins your view

1193
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:23,880
And if you've ever been on a beach

1194
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,880
Where you're seeing all you see

1195
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:26,880
Out there is

1196
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:27,880
Oil rigs

1197
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,880
It's not nice to look at

1198
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:30,880
I think that's really

1199
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,880
Pretty much the only reason why

1200
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,880
It's because they don't like bush

1201
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,880
Or I really don't know

1202
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,880
But I thought it was a pretty cool idea

1203
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,880
And I'm seeing it's commercial

1204
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,880
It's on television

1205
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,880
Talking about how he wants to build wind farms

1206
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,880
Around the United States

1207
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,880
And saying that it will

1208
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,880
They'll meet the restructure

1209
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,880
The power of grade

1210
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,880
And all kinds of neat stuff like that

1211
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:52,880
So maybe you could

1212
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,880
Say a little something about that

1213
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:55,880
On your show

1214
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,880
Haven't seen your show

1215
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:58,880
Haven't popped up in a while

1216
01:14:58,880 --> 01:14:59,880
As far as

1217
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:00,880
New one

1218
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,880
We've got a couple days

1219
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,880
I mean come on

1220
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:05,880
Anyway

1221
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:06,880
Have a great day

1222
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:07,880
And

1223
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,880
Holder

1224
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,880
Love you

1225
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,880
Take care

1226
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,880
Bye

1227
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:12,880
Alright man

1228
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:13,880
Thank you

1229
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,880
Yep

1230
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:15,880
Tea boon

1231
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,880
Piggins

1232
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,880
Like that name

1233
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:19,880
Wow

1234
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:20,880
This show is long

1235
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,880
I hope it's making up for

1236
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:23,880
Actually

1237
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:24,880
I gotta tell you that

1238
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:25,880
Doing two or three shows a week

1239
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:26,880
It suits me just fine

1240
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,880
Certainly if I can make them a little bit longer

1241
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:29,880
I haven't heard any complaints

1242
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,880
So I guess you guys are okay with it as well

1243
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:33,880
The final one kind of starting off

1244
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,880
Or ending up or we started off with

1245
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:36,880
With

1246
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:37,880
With

1247
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:38,880
What was it

1248
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,880
Um

1249
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:41,880
Uh

1250
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:43,880
Lindsey Williams being full of holes

1251
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,880
Here is

1252
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,880
The last one for the day

1253
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,880
For this footballer Friday

1254
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,880
And this is about 9-11

1255
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,880
And well listen to your listen for yourself

1256
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,880
I'm Chris Conquer here from Seattle

1257
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,880
I'm just listening to the latest daily source code

1258
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,880
And you're talking at the very beginning of the show

1259
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,880
About the press

1260
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,880
And kind of how there's different layers

1261
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,880
And how they like to report on what's safe

1262
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,880
And maybe I misunderstood

1263
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,880
And you, but I think you're completely full of crap

1264
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,880
There's no way on earth

1265
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,880
There's absolutely no way on earth

1266
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,880
But if there was a giant conspiracy cover up

1267
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,880
Over 9-11

1268
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,880
Now I'm not a bluetooth guy

1269
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,880
I mean let me say

1270
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,880
But there's no way on earth

1271
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,880
There's a giant conspiracy cover up

1272
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:33,880
The event is 9-11

1273
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,880
And the press had this information on their hands

1274
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,880
And they wouldn't report it

1275
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:38,880
I'll tell you why

1276
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,880
Because the agency that breaks about

1277
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:41,880
If it's true

1278
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,880
Become the number one news organization

1279
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:44,880
All time

1280
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,880
Oh oh oh oh oh

1281
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:47,880
Yeah

1282
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,880
Okay here's someone coming out of his cocoon

1283
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:50,880
Yeah

1284
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,880
Unfortunately that's just not the way it works

1285
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,880
And there's been plenty of individual reports

1286
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:56,880
Lots of them

1287
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:57,880
Lots of little documentaries

1288
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,880
And I'm talking about mainstream stuff

1289
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,880
Real mainstream reporting

1290
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:02,880
But it's not enough

1291
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,880
It doesn't get the traction

1292
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,880
And you know

1293
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,880
If it, if what you're saying really is true

1294
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:11,880
Then I mean there's enough sensational stuff

1295
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,880
And YouTube clips that

1296
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,880
Any network could buy that

1297
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:16,880
And a heartbeat

1298
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,880
Clear it, put it up and broadcast it

1299
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,880
And it would be sensational right

1300
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,880
Well how come they don't do that

1301
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:26,880
I mean is there any difference between a Britney Spears story

1302
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,880
Of her shaving her head

1303
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,880
And some of the out there

1304
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,880
Like there were no plain theories of 9-11

1305
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:35,880
I mean come on

1306
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:39,880
Like the BBC recently

1307
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:42,880
Did kind of a half debunking half leaving in the middle

1308
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,880
Type of story about about 9-11

1309
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,880
You know no one really talked about it

1310
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:48,880
It kind of came and went

1311
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,880
Because it's not on the agenda

1312
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,880
It's not being hammered home

1313
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,880
The way media is set up

1314
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,880
The way it works

1315
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,880
As free as I was at MTV

1316
01:17:58,880 --> 01:17:59,880
Or thought I was

1317
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,880
And there was no rule book

1318
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:03,880
Stuff came down from the top

1319
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,880
It was the DNA of the company

1320
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,880
The DNA of Viacom

1321
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,880
That steered us in certain directions

1322
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,880
And away from others

1323
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,880
It's just the way it works

1324
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,880
And stuff gets killed all the time

1325
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:16,880
Stories are made

1326
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,880
They don't necessarily make it on the air

1327
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,880
The stories that aren't are completely safe

1328
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,880
Don't make it on the air

1329
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,880
Or stay on the shelf for years

1330
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,880
But it's not true what you're saying

1331
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,880
Because again

1332
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:31,880
Look at anything out there

1333
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,880
Anything that's being discussed

1334
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:36,880
And there are plenty of examples

1335
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,880
Of real mainstream reporting

1336
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,880
Including the BBC by the way

1337
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:41,880
Financial times

1338
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:42,880
Does it all the time

1339
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,880
So real good solid reporting

1340
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:45,880
That is outrageous

1341
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:46,880
When you read it

1342
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:47,880
Or when you watch it

1343
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:48,880
Or when you listen to it

1344
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,880
But it just doesn't gather the traction

1345
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,880
And mainly it's because people think

1346
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:53,880
Now that's too crazy

1347
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:54,880
That's crazy

1348
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,880
Pretty spears

1349
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,880
Shaving her head

1350
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:58,880
Showing her beaver

1351
01:18:58,880 --> 01:18:59,880
That's real

1352
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,880
This stuff that's crazy

1353
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:02,880
That just can't be

1354
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:03,880
We've you know

1355
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,880
We've been educated that way

1356
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,880
The people are calling me crazy

1357
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,880
Now that shit my wife from time to time

1358
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:10,880
Is calling me nuts now

1359
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,880
You're going off the deep end

1360
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:13,880
She says

1361
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,880
And maybe she's right

1362
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,880
But it's not true that these coverups

1363
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,880
Just by reporting on them that all

1364
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:21,880
You know that all of a sudden

1365
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,880
It's going to be the richest news

1366
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:24,880
Organization in the world

1367
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,880
If it truly were that way

1368
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:26,880
They could do it

1369
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:27,880
They could do it today

1370
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:28,880
They could do it any second

1371
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:29,880
You're not going to tell me

1372
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:30,880
That there aren't questions

1373
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:31,880
That are unanswered

1374
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,880
I mean there has been no

1375
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:34,880
There was nothing

1376
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,880
In the 911 Commission report

1377
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,880
About building seven

1378
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:39,880
Nothing

1379
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:40,880
Not a single thing

1380
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,880
Could we at least have that explained

1381
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:43,880
Or please

1382
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:44,880
How about a little more on

1383
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,880
United Flight 93

1384
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:48,880
Do some research on that

1385
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,880
That's where you'll find some real coverup

1386
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,880
There's no reporting on that

1387
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,880
And it's not because

1388
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,880
The journalists don't want to

1389
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,880
It's because of the way the media

1390
01:19:58,880 --> 01:19:59,880
Has been consolidated

1391
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,880
Consolidate up

1392
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,880
Consolidated up to owners with corporate

1393
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,880
Initiatives and corporate

1394
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,880
Again, issues that have to be protected

1395
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:10,880
And of course

1396
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,880
You can also say that there's government

1397
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,880
Involvement or aluminum

1398
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,880
Involvement or whatever

1399
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,880
But I haven't been in media for all

1400
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,880
It's like the music business

1401
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:20,880
The music business

1402
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,880
If what you're saying is true

1403
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:22,880
Then all the best acts

1404
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,880
Would have number one hits

1405
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:25,880
But they don't now do they

1406
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:26,880
The best acts

1407
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,880
Are performing around the corner

1408
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,880
Or at your college

1409
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:30,880
Who'd nanny

1410
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,880
Those are the guys who rock the most

1411
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,880
But never get an album out there

1412
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:35,880
Do they?

1413
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,880
And that's easy to understand

1414
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,880
Because just like the media

1415
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,880
The record business

1416
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,880
Well, until their product

1417
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,880
Of course became worthless

1418
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,880
Because it's now

1419
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:47,880
Copyable within an instant

1420
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,880
And distributable across the world

1421
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,880
In the same small amount of time

1422
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,880
They had a lock on it

1423
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,880
Just create anything you want

1424
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:56,880
That's halfway decent

1425
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,880
Repeat it over and over and over again

1426
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,880
That's our new stories

1427
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:00,880
Become true

1428
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,880
Repeat it over and over and over again

1429
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:03,880
Play it on the radio

1430
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:04,880
Over and over and over again

1431
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,880
That's a fix by the way

1432
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,880
It's not coincidental

1433
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:11,880
The record companies have budgets

1434
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,880
And they know what songs they

1435
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,880
And what artists they think are viable

1436
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,880
And they make their choices

1437
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,880
And they have a deal with the radio stations

1438
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,880
Which have also been consolidated

1439
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,880
Into huge corporations

1440
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,880
Think of the clear channel

1441
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,880
And they decide what's going to be played

1442
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,880
So if it really was true

1443
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,880
What you're saying

1444
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,880
That all these great news stories

1445
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,880
That news organizations

1446
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,880
If they really were true

1447
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,880
That they would pick them up

1448
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,880
And they would be the richest news organizations

1449
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:42,880
In the world

1450
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:43,880
It's not true

1451
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:44,880
They're going to report on what they think is important to report on

1452
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,880
Just like the music business

1453
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,880
They're going to give you the music

1454
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:49,880
That they feel is important for you

1455
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,880
But it's really important for them

1456
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:52,880
That's how it works

1457
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:53,880
I don't want to worry about so

1458
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:54,880
And advertise anymore

1459
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,880
Does that make sense?

1460
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,880
There's a long way on earth

1461
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,880
But they're going to sit on information

1462
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:01,880
Like this

1463
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:02,880
It was a government

1464
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,880
There's two people who hate the Bush administration

1465
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,880
To allow them to continue what they're doing

1466
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:08,880
Oh, please

1467
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,880
Our own Congress, which is democratic

1468
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:15,880
Won't even try and get rid of Bush and Cheney

1469
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:16,880
Please

1470
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:17,880
The media is not going to do that

1471
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:19,880
People are afraid for their jobs

1472
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:20,880
That's why they don't do this shit

1473
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,880
They're afraid for their lives

1474
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:23,880
Maybe

1475
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:24,880
There's some kind of trouble

1476
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,880
What you say is so true

1477
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,880
And all these people who think of 9-11

1478
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,880
Never happened the way they did

1479
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:30,880
But you said it had to whatever

1480
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,880
And I'm going to even honor this issue

1481
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,880
What I'm saying is your premise is flawed

1482
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,880
There's no way that the mainstream media would sit on a story

1483
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,880
Like that

1484
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:40,880
And not reported

1485
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,880
Well, they're sitting on a right now

1486
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:43,880
And I'm reporting it

1487
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,880
The story is there

1488
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,880
There's a million different theories

1489
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:53,880
No different from the theories reported in the 9-11 Commission report

1490
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,880
And the media sitting on

1491
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:56,880
We're all sitting on it

1492
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:57,880
You've seen the videos

1493
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,880
You're sitting on it

1494
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,880
How come they're not reporting that

1495
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:03,880
It's what?

1496
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,880
Because it's not true

1497
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:06,880
What?

1498
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,880
That makes the 9-11 Commission report true

1499
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,880
They reported it on that

1500
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:11,880
No, no, no, no, no

1501
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:12,880
That's just unfortunately

1502
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,880
It's just not the way it works

1503
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,880
Simply because they make way to what's freaking money

1504
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,880
No, no, no, no, no

1505
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,880
I'll be dead

1506
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:21,880
I'll be dead

1507
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:22,880
I love you

1508
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:23,880
Don't worry about it

1509
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:24,880
I really do

1510
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,880
And you'll get there

1511
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:26,880
We're still awakening

1512
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,880
Did by bit

1513
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,880
Play one more for you

1514
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,880
Because we're rocking out for the weekend

1515
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:33,880
This is from the drop

1516
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:34,880
Delirious

1517
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:35,880
Bliss

1518
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,880
I feel lonely when it's you I miss

1519
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:58,880
I feel crazy when I dream I miss

1520
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,880
I've tried all of this way

1521
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:02,880
For just one kiss

1522
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:03,880
Is it bliss?

1523
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:04,880
Is it bliss?

1524
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,880
Is it bliss?

1525
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:11,880
Rock and roll is everything

1526
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,880
Everything's so lonely

1527
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:22,880
And never will I be there for you

1528
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,880
I love you

1529
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:26,880
I love you

1530
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,880
I love you

1531
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,880
I love you

1532
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:35,880
I love you

1533
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:36,880
I love you

1534
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,880
I feel like I'm home to the place

1535
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,880
Where it goes

1536
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:48,880
I where my love for you

1537
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,880
I've never traveled

1538
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:59,880
If I'm right, then you won't

1539
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:03,880
If I'm wrong, then I will live

1540
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,880
If I die with no reward

1541
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,880
And I know I have peace

1542
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,880
To the carrot the soul

1543
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,880
I try to get to my heart

1544
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,880
I don't know if I can get to my heart

1545
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:23,880
If I'm wrong, then you won't live

1546
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:45,880
It's a simple thing

1547
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:49,880
The saddest fight Keep my feet on the ground

1548
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:53,880
And my head in the sky All of you more

1549
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:57,880
Then I can't say And I won't change my mind

1550
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:59,880
All the choices I've made

1551
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:16,880
Nigel Bye-bye, Là-bye�-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-Bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Hail-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-bye, Là-

1552
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:48,360
I had a final fun phone to read.

1553
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:49,560
Well, there you go.

1554
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,760
Final thought of the week.

1555
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:53,360
I've really enjoyed what we just went through.

1556
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,360
I hope you liked as well.

1557
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:57,160
It's only an hour and a half, so crap.

1558
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,160
That was a lot, but it was also good.

1559
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:02,600
I almost didn't want to leave anything out.

1560
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,280
So I don't hear people who are anti-conspiracy theorists.

1561
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:10,240
I don't hear people who are totally outrageously opposed to the ideas.

1562
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:12,240
I hear people who are slowly awakening,

1563
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,080
and that's what I really appreciate.

1564
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:19,280
All the way from my friend who said that not on news organizations would have brought this

1565
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,840
to light if it really was any truth to the matter.

1566
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:24,640
That's someone who's coming out of it.

1567
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:28,480
That's someone who's coming very, very slowly, and all the way through to the Lindsay Williams

1568
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:29,480
stories full of crap.

1569
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,480
It's frustration.

1570
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:31,480
I can hear it.

1571
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:34,960
You guys are awakening, and I love it.

1572
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,360
So that's what I'm hearing.

1573
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:40,040
And if you got some thoughts, please call it into the voicemail line.

1574
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:46,120
You'll find those on the show notes at dailysourceco.com, or of course, at curie.com, or

1575
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:49,840
for time to time, I post them on yourself, so that would be my final thought of the

1576
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:50,840
week.

1577
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:55,120
Look around you, pay attention, listen to the codes, listen to the messages, and welcome

1578
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,120
to the awakening.

1579
01:27:56,120 --> 01:28:08,640
So have yourselves a great weekend, live your life with passion, please.

1580
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:14,840
I'll at last enjoy your freedom, another fine, medial presentation, stick it in your

1581
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:15,240
ear.
