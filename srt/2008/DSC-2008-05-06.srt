1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We don't need lost digging trees in

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I guess this is a great

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Game is the right

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The man of my brain

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The one who did not belong

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And the one who did not belong

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The only thing we lost is a real man

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,800
All you make and hide it's no matter what you get past it'll be right now

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,800
All you make and hide it's no matter what you get past it'll be right now

26
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,800
All you make and hide it's no matter what you get past it'll be right now

27
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,800
All you make and hide it's no matter what you get past it'll be right now

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,400
All you make and hide it's no matter what you get past it'll be right now

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,600
Feel many times, you need to be the one

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,000
But all you ever want was the past little girl

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,600
But now that I'm not in love with you

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,800
It's not how that's me, feel like I'm in love with you

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,400
I'm not like I'm in love with you

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,000
You've got a lot of my way of being a body

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,600
It's getting red, yeah

36
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,800
If you're having a good look, don't you feel like I'm in love with you

37
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
And I'm in love with you

38
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,000
What's no matter what you get past it'll be right now

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,800
All you make and hide it's no matter what you get past it'll be right now

40
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,600
All you make and hide it's no matter what you get past it'll be right now

41
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,200
All you make and hide it's no matter what you get past it'll be right now

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,600
Oh man, and that's what I call a mashup

43
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Go home production's coming out of mashup retirement source by Dr. Art for mashuptown.com

44
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
C.C.Penistan and the Sex Pestacles

45
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Yes, now that is the way a mashup should fit together finally. Did you know wrong daily source code episode number 754. Hey everybody. How you doing?

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,400
I just want to talk to you. I'm much I know that new website of yours

47
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,400
That maybe a web-shodditch Mr. Snowberry

48
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
You got a nice yellow lips to their boy

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,400
I'm glad you love it everybody. How are you coming to you from an absolutely astoundingly beautiful

50
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Beautiful United Kingdom of course we're in the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Gilford here in the curry manner

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,400
I've got all the all the windows wide open here up in the attic

52
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,400
You can even hear the birds tweeting around a little bit and I apologize for yesterday

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,400
A lot of things went really really wrong technically

54
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:25,400
You know, I've you know we're exporting some of the daily source quick source code format to terrestrial radio in the Netherlands

55
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:34,400
And so the way that's being done is through a digital connection with their studio in the hay from the from the manner and

56
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Conversely from the condo when appropriate when I'm there of course

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Please calculate your local times on where necessary and I've never really worked with one of these things before

58
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,400
And this is a tried and true, you know, it's been tried and tested and it's worked in the field over and over again

59
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,400
I just never really had the opportunity to work with what is known as the co-deck connections of course

60
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
We know codex from

61
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,400
From the video and audio world empty three of course

62
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Is a compression technology you need a co-deck a coder and a decoder

63
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,400
But for some reason in broadcasting they call a co-deck just this big box that hooks up to an ISDN line

64
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,400
It I gotta tell you it is absolutely phenomenal like I called

65
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
The

66
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Jonsi de Borac before he left for Korea and I said dude you've got to get one of these

67
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,400
I know you have an ISDN line which he has somewhere probably has to reactivate it

68
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,400
But wow you can you it's like sitting next to each other

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,400
And there's almost no delay it's like you know just it's probably less the delay than talking over a cell phone

70
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Which of course is also a digital connection

71
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
I'm just blown away by it however

72
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,400
As I said about putting all of this together

73
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
I know what am I hearing here

74
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Oh I'm hearing lawnmowers and shit outside

75
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,400
A couple things that I learned something and I discovered something I just say

76
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,400
The first one is for some reason whenever I connect my

77
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,400
My monitor my have an apple cinema display

78
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,400
It completely

79
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Introduced some kind of ground loop into my in fact

80
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,400
You know how you have on the on the cinema display you have

81
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,400
USUSB ports on the back so you basically you plug in

82
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,400
One USB cable which goes into the monitor along with the DCI connector

83
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
Whatever that monitor connector is called

84
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Just listen what happens when I went and the monitor is not connected

85
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,400
The monitor is off it is plugged into the mains unit

86
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,400
But listen what happens when all I'm going to do is I'm just going to plug in the USB into the Mac

87
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
That I'm using to record hold on

88
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Wait a minute I got to unplug something here and let me try this

89
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Check this out it'll freak you out ready

90
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Where is it which slot there we go?

91
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Is this the right one?

92
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
I can't even get it in

93
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
I can't get it in honey give me a break

94
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Wait maybe the other way around

95
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Listen to that

96
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,400
That's just out shit

97
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
I just spilled my tea

98
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,400
My Louis Catordesk is completely ruined once again

99
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
That's not good

100
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Wasn't a big bunch but

101
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,400
So you know I love working with two monitors and my whole setup

102
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,400
If you see the picture that I posted over on flicker

103
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
I think was it last week or the week before

104
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,400
You'll see that I've set up for two monitors is perfect

105
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
But I can't use them and I have no idea why this is happening

106
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,400
I've tried you know I spent the whole literally five or six hours

107
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Most of yesterday's working day before San Francisco kicked in around 4 o'clock

108
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Trying to debug this and I could not find it

109
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,400
First you know it's just unplugging everything and then who would think

110
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Who would think that the monitor would cross such a such a bunch of crap

111
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,400
So I'm back to using the laptop screen which is kind of a bummer

112
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,400
But if anyone has any ideas and this ground loop shit is really really tricky

113
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,400
I know it is but I certainly appreciate any help

114
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
And then the second thing so I was testing with these guys

115
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,400
In the studio and you know the way I have my setup

116
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,400
And I'm so happy I got this before I created the long promise screen cast

117
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Of what my setup looks like

118
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,400
So the guys were listening they said you've got a noise gate on it

119
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Which you know right whenever you

120
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,400
Whenever I stop talking then all of a sudden it goes really really quiet

121
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Because I don't want all this extraneous noise coming in

122
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
It says you know that's kind of a loser way to do it

123
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
And I was like oh really

124
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
He says yeah what you want to do is you want to

125
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Take your microphone you want to put it into a compressor

126
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
And you want to lower it down a little bit

127
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,400
And then you want to put an exciter right after the compressor

128
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
And it almost works like a noise gate

129
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Which is happening right now so for instance if I'm quiet

130
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,400
You'll hear a little bit of things in the background

131
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,400
But it's not like bringing up that big noise and then cutting it off

132
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,400
And so it's yeah it's actually

133
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Much nicer way of doing things I think

134
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,400
So learn something new there I never heard of

135
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,400
I've setting up a compressor and an exciter or an expander

136
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,400
I think they might call it sometimes never heard of setting up as an noise gate

137
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
But there you go learn something new every day

138
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,400
And still to come still to come I promise you

139
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Full blown screen cast of all of the bits and pieces that are the the curry setup

140
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
I got a fantastic link from someone

141
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,400
I want you and I will remember to put this in the show notes

142
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,400
It's called life goes on in Tehran

143
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
It's life goes on in Tehran.com

144
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
And Tehran by the way if you don't know the way

145
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,400
I think this is the official English spelling is T-E-H

146
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Or actually tango echo hotel Romeo alpha november

147
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Tehran

148
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,400
It's basically every single I think it's every day

149
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
But at least once a month

150
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,400
It's pictures from Tehran pictures of ordinary life pictures of Tehran itself

151
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Pictures of the city of Tehran which I have to say right off the bat

152
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Looks pretty damned depressing

153
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
But pictures of people

154
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,400
You really get an incredible feel

155
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,400
What Iranian or Tehran life is like

156
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
And of course parts of Iranian life

157
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,400
It's a pretty big country I'm sure it's not all like the city of Tehran

158
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
But I want you to take a look at that

159
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Next time someone is doing some saber rattling

160
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
About bombing Iran

161
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Take a look and see what will be bombing

162
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Take a look at this beautiful country

163
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
And tell me that you agree with that

164
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,400
You know this is a saber rattling

165
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
I love that we talked about that in no agenda

166
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,400
And something that I hadn't actually brought up

167
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
This is kind of funny

168
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,400
There's something going on and I'm not quite understanding what's happening

169
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,400
They call it a Thoritarian behavior

170
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,400
There's a huge movement amongst Chinese youth

171
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
And there's a lot of them

172
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
What is a country hold?

173
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
One point three billion people

174
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
There's a huge movement who are saying

175
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Hey you guys got the wrong idea

176
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
You're giving us a bum wrap

177
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Where a China's great

178
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,400
And I think the I forget the name of it

179
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
But the translation of this movement

180
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,400
This group of kids is called Angry Chinese kids

181
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
I saw it in financial times

182
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
I'll have to look up the article

183
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
to see exactly what the description was

184
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Like Angry Chinese kids

185
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Is kind of what this descriptive name

186
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,400
And so we've been talking here on the daily source code

187
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,400
About perhaps not buying products from China

188
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
But in the meantime

189
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Since the Olympic torch was accosted

190
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Well I guess France had the biggest kind of to do

191
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,400
They tried to douse it in London

192
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
In France I think they were actually successful

193
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
They got a hold of it

194
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,400
And it was just more of a kerfuffle and skirmish

195
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
I love those words

196
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Then in any other country

197
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
And so the Chinese are now

198
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Lashing out at the French gross

199
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
I think it's gross re-retailer

200
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Cocklefour

201
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,400
Which is kind of like a French Walmart

202
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
I'll just leave it at that

203
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
It's not exactly that

204
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
It's like a big box store

205
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
And so they're analyzing the stores

206
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
And they're doing exactly what we've been discussing

207
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Here about doing to them

208
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,400
They're doing to the western to the western people

209
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Not to the US but they're doing it to the French

210
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Are we nuts?

211
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,400
And should we just write that off and say

212
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Oh well you know they're probably pre-programmed

213
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Or this concept of being a authoritarian

214
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
I think that's what it is

215
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
There's a whole PDF on the daily source code

216
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Drop about this

217
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Some PhD wrote like a 237 page book

218
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Which you released a free

219
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
And I think I've gotten to page 18

220
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,400
But the whole idea that people will follow leaders stupidly

221
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Which of course we're pretty good at

222
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,400
And I'm thinking is there really that much difference

223
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Between us and our Chinese brothers and sisters

224
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
It just you know

225
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Maybe they've been indoctrinated with all kinds of

226
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Media messages for the past 50 years as well

227
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
I think that's pretty possible

228
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,400
And I don't know

229
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
I gotta get my ass over to China

230
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
I really really have to go

231
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
All right

232
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
A couple of things that hit a nerve

233
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
With with you chuckle heads

234
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Which means that I got a lot of responses

235
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
The first one was my idea of rebranding nuclear energy

236
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
In general

237
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Actually when I was prepping the show

238
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I was thinking you know

239
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
I was particularly after speaking to

240
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Our energies have on rod atoms

241
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Atomic rod

242
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Now I'm relatively convinced that

243
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,400
The nuclear waste issue is not quite as bad as it sounds

244
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,400
And it's you know nuclear waste is not a barrel of oozing goo

245
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,400
It's basically a block

246
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Which can be easily restored

247
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,400
I'm not quite sure about radiation

248
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
I mean there's a lot of things I don't know

249
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,400
But I do know that there's been a very systematic campaign

250
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Against nuclear energy for the past 20 or 30 years

251
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,400
And that technology doesn't prove

252
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
And I'm very interested in learning more about it

253
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,400
And then I saw Boston legal last night

254
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
And it was about this very issue

255
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
About a nuclear power plant coming to someone's town

256
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
On the town didn't want to have it there

257
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
And it was about radiation

258
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
So I'm more confused than I was

259
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
But one thing for sure

260
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
If we do want to go down this route

261
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,400
We have to remove the word nuclear

262
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Or atomic

263
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Because that has all these connotations

264
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Of an oligay and mushroom clouds and bad stuff

265
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
So I thought maybe we could rename it

266
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Well technically it's called fission

267
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,400
If a fuck-straught India CRSCR or India Oscar November

268
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
And I was thinking yeah that's not quite a sexy name

269
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Can we call it fusion? Well I got a lot of comments about that okay?

270
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Hey Adam

271
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,400
I just wanted to let you know that rebranding nuclear energy is fusion

272
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Might be a little difficult

273
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Fission and fusion are definitely not the same thing

274
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Fission is breaking out of the part

275
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,400
And fusion is putting them together more or less

276
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Both of them can be sources of energy

277
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,400
But at the moment, fission that is nuclear power

278
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Is much, much easier to perform practically

279
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,400
And fusion is still quite a ways off

280
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,400
It seems as far as being a viable way to obtain energy

281
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,400
So rebranding fission is fusion would be

282
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Very misleading and very confusing

283
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,400
And probably not the best idea

284
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,400
But I'm sure we can find some sort of cool name for it

285
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,400
That will turn nuclear energy into something that might be a little more acceptable

286
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,400
To have around our homes and businesses

287
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
So see you later Adam

288
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Alright so of course solar and wind is known as green

289
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Well it could be, it could easily fit under green

290
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
I mean I think the waste is green isn't it?

291
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
We'll start to glow green if it goes wrong

292
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,400
I can hear atomic rod just getting ready to record some feedback as we speak

293
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,400
The other thing I asked you I think last week is

294
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Why no one has purchased any of the insurance from acuco.com

295
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Which has been sponsoring the show for about a month and a half

296
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
The sponsorship is actually over

297
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
And I just want to continue because I want to understand it

298
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
And I got some fantastic feedback from you guys

299
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Two pieces that I want to play for you

300
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Well worth it because I've learned something about you chuckle heads

301
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,400
And you might even learn something as well

302
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Oops sorry about that

303
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Here we go

304
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
I understand from Boston

305
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
I'm driving along

306
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Interstate 95 towards New Hampshire

307
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
I'm a way to graduate school

308
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Completely secure in the knowledge that if I do something stupid while I'm talking on the phone

309
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Hey hey, where'd that guy come from?

310
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Oh sorry, I'm just kidding

311
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,400
If anything stupid happens to me and I die my wife is going to get my insurance policy

312
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
That I have through the United States Army

313
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
The servicemen's group life insurance

314
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,400
We call it signaling because everything's an acronym in the Army

315
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,400
So I already have my insurance buddy

316
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Thanks for offering

317
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
I'll be show by that

318
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Yeah man, thank you

319
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
And please be careful

320
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
We don't want anyone to have to get in on that

321
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Yeah, I of course I don't know what the payout is of that type of insurance

322
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,400
But I had forgotten about that

323
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,400
A lot of people who are in the demographic of the daily source code have served

324
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,400
Hey by the way, if you've been to Iraq or if you've been to Afghanistan

325
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,400
I'm trying to get my English accent going here

326
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Afghanistan

327
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,400
If you've been to Iraq or Afghanistan

328
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Give me a call man

329
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
I'd love to talk to you

330
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,400
I'll just call on the voicemail and just tell me what's going on

331
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Or if does anyone over there listen to it?

332
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Do you guys have access to it?

333
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Is there someone who can actually get the show?

334
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Boy

335
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
I would be really nice

336
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Alright, here's another one

337
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,400
This is actually a little more explanation

338
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Why this charcoal head didn't go for the ACU code offer?

339
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Check it out

340
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Hey Adam, this is Sean J.

341
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
It'll restrict the cast and Hamilton

342
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,400
I got a comment about the ACU code thing

343
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,400
I actually did go to the ACU code site

344
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,400
And I used Jersey Todd code because I didn't have money more than you did

345
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Yeah, thanks

346
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,400
And I don't know if I was just not paying attention

347
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Or I was kind of surprised that it was a

348
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,400
A comparison site that compared other companies

349
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
I was assuming it was its own company

350
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Like I don't know if some of those other ones

351
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
They're insurance and stuff like that

352
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Yeah, that is a good point

353
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
And I kind of went through the same process

354
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
When I was looking for car insurance over here

355
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
And I went to compare.com

356
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
And I also thought that that was an assurer

357
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,400
who would give me a quote

358
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
And that was also the name says it

359
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
A comparison site

360
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,400
They are hugely successful though

361
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
I mean they're advertising on television

362
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
And something is working really, really well

363
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
So

364
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Interesting to find out what kind of person

365
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
uses a site like that

366
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Clearly not this chocolate

367
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
And so I think it's the nature of that company

368
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Because I did look at the prices

369
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
And I did look at different companies offering the prices

370
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,400
But then I went to my insurance company

371
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
That I have for other stuff

372
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
For my auto and things like that

373
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
And it's a more comparing

374
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,400
So to get me to go back to that site

375
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
Was going to have to be

376
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
You know yet another trip to the computer

377
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
And that's okay

378
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
So you're insurer wasn't one of the ones being compared

379
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
That doesn't sound right

380
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Let me know what you're insurer is

381
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Let's see why it wasn't on theacucot.com site

382
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Or why you felt it wasn't represented

383
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
And that's interesting

384
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
So I kind of feel what's happening now

385
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
There's too many steps from the actual product

386
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
I think

387
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
I don't know if that's true for everybody

388
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
But that's kind of the experience that I had

389
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Because I did want to support you guys

390
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
But it seems to me like a

391
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Reference role of a refer

392
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Of a company if that makes sense

393
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
So it's a little bit removed

394
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
I'm certainly not a reason why I didn't buy through them

395
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,400
You know I didn't consciously say oh there's just three first

396
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
I'm not going to purchase through them

397
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,400
But it was an extra step removed

398
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
From the process of purchasing

399
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
To me

400
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
And I think that's why I didn't go back

401
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Now I still have yet to purchase

402
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,400
But I think that that may be part of the deal

403
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,400
That I initially thought it was a company that was selling the life insurance

404
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
As opposed to a referral company

405
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,400
That could gauge discounts from various

406
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Insurance companies like a

407
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
You know a travel office or

408
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
With the other one

409
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Kind of website

410
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Anyway

411
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
It's great here

412
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Hope you in

413
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Love you

414
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Don't care if you're home

415
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
And I'll talk to you later

416
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Keep up the great work

417
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
All right man, thank you

418
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
What I don't know is if you got any insurance

419
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
I don't know

420
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
I don't know

421
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,400
I don't know

422
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
I don't know

423
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
I don't know

424
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
I don't know

425
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
I don't know

426
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
I don't know

427
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
I don't know

428
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
I just wanted to congratulate you on a no agenda

429
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Number 20 I think it was

430
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
I couldn't find the number for calling in

431
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
So I just called into the daily source code

432
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,400
It was highly entertaining, highly topical

433
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Really funny, in fact I laughed my ass off

434
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,400
For any DSC listeners who are not getting no agenda

435
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Get it

436
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
I never thought it would be so entertaining to listen to two guys

437
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Just two in the fight

438
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
But it's fucking awesome

439
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
And you guys are real

440
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Right here in the home

441
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Three times a week

442
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Look at some improvement

443
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Three times a week

444
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
Looking for improvement

445
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
Let me see the prostate cancer prevention

446
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
Quotient here in the curry manner

447
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
stands at one for this week

448
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
So I am also a little bit behind

449
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
If you are wondering what this is all about

450
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Well, then you should be listening to this show more often

451
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Daily scores go to episode number 754

452
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
We missed the Friday

453
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
You know what that means

454
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Time for y'all pull that shit test

455
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Hey Adam, it's time for hit test again

456
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
And we're gonna start right away with intro number one

457
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Oh

458
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Works to be in

459
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Oh, yes, y'all that would be genophonelli

460
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Number two

461
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Oh, y'all these are great

462
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Janet Jackson's control

463
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,400
In her old incarnation and number three y'all hit me and the final one is number three

464
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Oh, gee

465
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Let me think couldn't be arrows mid to run the MC walk this way

466
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Did I get three this time three stars out of three

467
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,400
And times up and all of these weeks answers are from

468
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
I mean

469
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Test

470
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
And so number one genophonelli

471
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
And

472
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Oh

473
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
That's number one in this week

474
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,400
It has the genophonelli and it hurts to be in love

475
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
And this is answer number two

476
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
Janet Jackson

477
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
We're not certain

478
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
I think people

479
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
Don't be

480
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
Oh

481
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
I don't

482
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Never go

483
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
It's the

484
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
I don't

485
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
I don't

486
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
I don't

487
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
I don't

488
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
I don't

489
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
I want to go

490
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Janet Jackson

491
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Go

492
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
As answer number two

493
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
And this is answer number three

494
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Arrows mid and run the MC

495
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Walk this way

496
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
No

497
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Don't do it

498
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
No

499
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Don't do it

500
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
It's way

501
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Don't do it

502
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Walk this way

503
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Don't do it

504
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Walk this way

505
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:36,080
One DMC, there's Nathan walked this way and danced with number three and that concludes

506
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
hit us number 120.

507
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,320
So, Adam, how did you do this week?

508
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,480
Well, Ian, I am so happy you took the song for 96 or 87.

509
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,720
I got three out of three, I love it!

510
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720

So, until then, have a very nice week, take care and remember, try to think with your

519
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
hearts.

520
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Bye-bye.

521
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:28,240
Hi, Adam, it's Matt from Gamesweasel on this week's show.

522
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,800
We've got a review of UEFA Euro 2008 on the PlayStation 3.

523
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,400
We look at the new Call of Duty variety map hack for the 360 and you can win copies

524
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
of Warriors and Watchy for the PC.

525
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,160
That's all it gamesweasel.com.

526
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:17,040
Yeah, I'm a match, I'm a fighter with the wall against my back.

527
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:23,040
You better get a big hook on them, not dead yet, I'm ever seen your hand, your tight

528
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
jack level deck.

529
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:30,720
That's what I'm made from, you play a warhead, it's from a jet-white with no parachute.

530
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,240
Shop by fire, fire, squad of rake, fire, business, do it.

531
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:44,720
If we don't let my one leg live, I can still crawl and I'm not dead yet, not dead yet,

532
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,280
not dead yet, I'm a match, I'm got it with the wall against my back.

533
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:58,200
You better get a big hook on them, not dead yet.

534
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:08,200
You better get a big hook on them, not dead yet, I'm got it with the wall against my back.

535
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:18,200
You better get a big hook on them, not dead yet, I'm got it with the wall against my back.

536
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:28,200
You better get a big hook on them, not dead yet, I'm a match, I'm got it with the wall against my back.

537
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,200
You better get a big hook on them, not dead yet.

538
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:42,200
You better get a big hook on them, not dead yet, I'm got it with the wall against my back.

539
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:48,200
You better get a big hook on them, not dead yet, I'm got it with the wall against my back.

540
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,200
You better get a big hook on them, not dead yet, I'm got it with the wall against my back.

541
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,200
You better get a big hook on them, not dead yet, I'm got it with the wall against my back.

542
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:08,200
You better get a big hook on them, not dead yet, I'm got it with the wall against my back.

543
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:16,200
You better get a big hook on them, not dead yet, I'm got it with the wall against my back.

544
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:26,200
You better get a big hook on them, not dead yet, I'm got it with the wall against my back.

545
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Nothing, yeah, I don't want my heart waitin' in the middle of the day

546
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,200
You better get up, make it go for nothing, yeah

547
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Nothing, yeah, nothing, yeah

548
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,200
What's not, yeah, nothing, yeah nothing, yeah nothing

549
00:27:50,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Nothing, yeah nothing, yeah nothing, yeah nothing, yeah nothing

550
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,200
That example, not dead yet

551
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,200
I'm not quite sure if that's pod save for none

552
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
It was a drop down the daily source code drop

553
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,200
What you can find in the show notes drop.io slash daily source code

554
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Now I want to talk to you about something else that relates to that very, very cool

555
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,200
The billboard article finally came out

556
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Let me just see if I can bring up a copy because I only have a PDF

557
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,200
I've also put this PDF into the drop by the way

558
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,200
At drop.io slash daily source code

559
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,200
This is the article that was written by Evie Nagy

560
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,200
I think it's Nagy, Nagy, Nagy and November alpha golf Yankee

561
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,200
It's a full page article, it's all about the pod save music revolution

562
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Features quotes from myself

563
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,200
It's a monk, it really kicks off with monk's success story

564
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,200
It brings in mainstream, here, this is the, I love this

565
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,200
I really love this, check it out

566
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,200
We view it as an artist development tool

567
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Jason Spiewock, president of rock ridge marketing

568
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,200
Which uses the pod save music network to promote tracks from acts

569
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Including collective soul and buck cherry

570
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Quote, it's directed file sharing, love that by the way

571
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,200
Directed file sharing, great, great concept

572
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,200
It's a calculated risk, research is proven

573
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,200
The giving away music doesn't not inhibit sales

574
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,200
If anything, it's the opposite

575
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Wow

576
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,200
And you know, this is really, the title is kind of funny though

577
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,200
The title of the article, which of course I'm sure Evie didn't come up with

578
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
It's called potting along

579
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Subtitle, podcast growth, creating viable marketing route for artists

580
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Nah, that's cool

581
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,200
And of course, an incredibly glamor shot of myself inserted there

582
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
But what's important about this article

583
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,200
And again, you can look at the PDF

584
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Drop.au slash daily source code, link in the show

585
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
No, it's a daily source code.com

586
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,200
What's great about it is this billboard is still an industry magazine

587
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,200
I've already received about 10 emails from people who haven't heard from

588
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
40 years

589
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,200
Including from the independent promotion business

590
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
From promotional departments and record companies

591
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,200
Just people saying, wow, you know, this is fantastic

592
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
It's finally happening in congratulations

593
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,200
And I'm like, yes, yes, yes, yes

594
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
I'm loving it

595
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,200
I think Evie did a really really good job

596
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,200
I tried to scammer into letting me see it before I went to print

597
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Which he refused to do

598
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
And when she was actually pretty funny about it

599
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,200
She said, well, just like you wouldn't release revenue

600
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,200
And earnings numbers for at the time pod show

601
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
Now, mevia, which she also got right in the article

602
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
By the way, she said, we have a policy

603
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,200
I'm not showing it

604
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Not showing the article before it's published

605
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
But factually, I think it's

606
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,200
I think even the numbers are seen very factually correct

607
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,200
So I'm just proud of this man, this is great

608
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,200
You know, you get to do a lot of interviews

609
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,200
And a lot of it is online these days, of course, websites, etc

610
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,200
But to have something show up in billboard magazine full page

611
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
I don't know if it's the left hand or the right hand page

612
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,200
But I'm sure it's going to wake some people up

613
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,200
And my feeling is that

614
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,200
My feeling is that it's going to lead to something

615
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,200
So I would say, watch this space

616
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Particularly because there's a drunken Londoner walk

617
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
And throw it

618
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
Hello

619
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Adam, hi, it's Charles John Londoner

620
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,200
It's London WMI, I'm in Warren Street

621
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Basically, he's London Central London

622
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,200
So if it's program, what a great message that was

623
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
He had me in pictures

624
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Oh, God, this money stuff, the Gordon Brown thing

625
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Oh my God, it's not going to be so angry

626
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
It's making me so angry

627
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
I don't comment on it, I don't think about it

628
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Because I feel so fucking powerless

629
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,200
But when it was the monetary scientist

630
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
Dude, phone deal was

631
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
I mean, at the billgate sounding guy

632
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,200
That whole section, just finished listening to it on the tube

633
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,200
Oh God, it just makes, I want a scream, I want a yell

634
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,200
What do we do? What do we do Adam?

635
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Guide me, help me, what are we fucking do?

636
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
How can I change it?

637
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
How can I get the message to these guns?

638
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,200
So they can't just go stealing our fucking money

639
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
I'm getting, I've got a gun down man

640
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,200
I listen, uh, Charles about to check drunken

641
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,200
From now, Western way, W1

642
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,200
I'm 33, uh, I'm a folder, I'm a dyslexic

643
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
I'm sure you've got good head today

644
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,200
You're already won as far as I'm concerned

645
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
And I hope you continue to

646
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Because I enjoy what you're doing

647
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
And, uh, please stop being up for us

648
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,200
Please don't get that man in, give me words

649
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
To be a lot worse

650
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Uh, vote for Ken, if you have to

651
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Go green, because uh, she's a hot man

652
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

653
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
Clearly, uh, Charles, phone this in

654
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Before the results of the London mayoral elections

655
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,200
Uh, which, of course, was W1, was W1 by uh

656
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
BJ, Boris Johnson

657
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Sure, there's a joke in there somewhere

658
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
Yeah, so Charles getting pretty worked up about that

659
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
And, of course, he's referring to

660
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Uh, the way the UK government is taking

661
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,200
Tax money and bailing out banks and

662
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Proping up the global financial system

663
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
Uh, he's angry

664
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,200
And this is uh, fits right into this email

665
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
I got from John Christenbury, he says

666
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
Adam something I've noticed that I'm sure someone

667
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
As mentioned before is the absurdity

668
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,200
In the fact that when a sports team wins or loses

669
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
America, people storm the streets

670
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Turn over cars, light shit on fire

671
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
They take to the streets

672
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,200
However, when petrol, gasoline

673
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Is $4 a gallon

674
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
And the government is screwing us

675
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Taking all our money, giving it away

676
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,200
We all sit back and watch

677
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
What the fuck is up with that?

678
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Thank you

679
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
I'm very good going

680
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
What the fuck is up with that?

681
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,200
What does it take to get people to get

682
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
On to the streets?

683
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Apparently, uh, a friendly sports match

684
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,200
By the way, I've also started to think a little bit about

685
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,200
This $4 a gallon gasoline

686
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
You know, in reality

687
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,200
Um, I think it could probably double

688
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Double to about a seven or eight dollars

689
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,200
Before any actual protest will take place

690
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,200
And I based it on the fact that pretty much

691
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,200
Everywhere else in the world

692
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Unless it's a place that really is producing a lot of oil

693
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
But certainly

694
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Certainly here in Europe, continental Europe, Western Europe

695
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,200
You know, we're paying seven to eight bucks a gallon for gasoline

696
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,200
And it's expensive, but we're getting by

697
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
So, can America take a doubling?

698
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Will it take that long before people get pissed off

699
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,200
And take to the streets or do we have to have your favorite team

700
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Win or lose in the Super Bowl?

701
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,200
Maybe it's something we can do with the children

702
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
Hey Adam, Jason from San Diego

703
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,200
So I'm just going to throw in my two cents about this

704
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,200
People taking action or not taking action and things

705
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Getting the government they deserve

706
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
I agree with you

707
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
I think it's a lot of apathy

708
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
But I also think that

709
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,200
Maybe United States is not breeding leaders

710
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
Like they used to

711
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,200
They're not influence and their children to be leaders

712
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,200
They're influence and them to be individuals

713
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,200
To be standalone and stand out

714
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
From the crowd

715
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,200
And the best person you can be

716
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,200
And you know, make it to the top alone

717
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,200
And you know, do what you can to survive

718
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,200
But it's not about, you know, greater good

719
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,200
You know, become a, you know, the mayor

720
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Become a school board, become a president

721
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Nobody's growing up anymore saying

722
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,200
I want to be the president

723
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
So that's what I think the problem is

724
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,200
Not breeding leaders breeding

725
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
Emphasitic, not empathetic

726
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Appasitic, a little branch

727
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
Late

728
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Hi, now some good points there

729
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,200
This is one of the reasons I enjoy this

730
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,200
So whole process of Holland's Got Talent

731
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Which Patricia is a judge on, of course, the lady P

732
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
It's the Dutch version of

733
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Britain's Got Talent or America's Got Talent

734
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,200
I love watching the kids that participate

735
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
And I like it for a number of reasons

736
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
One is, you know, it's like

737
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,200
And this is here's to be an incredible amount of people

738
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Who still have past times such as

739
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Baton twirling, acrobatics, magic, clowns

740
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,200
And, you know, although I'm not a big fan of all those genres

741
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,200
I really do like the fact that our kids are doing that

742
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,200
You know, they're not all just playing grand theft auto

743
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Which by the way, I so have to get my hands on that

744
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,200
I got to get a, what is it on a playstation or whatever

745
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
I got to get a console, I have to play this

746
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
This looks really good

747
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,200
So that really makes me feel really happy on one hand

748
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,200
But on the other hand, you know, you can see that they're

749
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Really competing because they want to be famous

750
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,200
And they want to have what they think is a fantastic career

751
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,200
And of course, if you were really to look at the amount of people

752
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,200
That are featured in celebrity ragmags

753
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,200
The numbers of those who are actually making lots of money

754
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,200
It's quite small, it's probably 1%

755
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
So that's a, it's a far so by itself

756
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,200
But, you know, that being aspirational is pretty sad

757
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,200
You're right, I mean, where are the kids?

758
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
If you have a kid at home

759
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,200
If you have a kid who is said, I want to grow up to be president

760
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
I want to talk to him or her

761
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,200
You know, in fact, that's another good question

762
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,200
If you have a daughter, she does she look up to Hillary Clinton

763
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,200
Like, wow, maybe one day I could be in the front runner for president

764
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
My daughter has not said one word about it

765
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
I don't think she cares

766
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,200
And we talk about this stuff all the time at home

767
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,200
But, man, it's hard to break through that wall of iPods and Facebook

768
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,200
And hangin' out and part of that is just being a teenager of course

769
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,200
But, where's the conversation they're having about the world?

770
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,200
I know they're conversing with the rest of the world

771
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,200
I know that she talks to people on the internet

772
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Or converses with people on the internet all over the globe

773
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
But, where's the conversation about what's happening?

774
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Where's the conversation that goes further than Bush's a dick

775
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,200
Or this guy's a crap when this guy's a Clinton, whatever

776
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,200
Does it really take place?

777
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Is there a place I can find this on the internet

778
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
When teenagers are talking about this stuff

779
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,200
I know I certainly was thinking and talking that way

780
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
When I was her age

781
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Let me see how we do it on time here today

782
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
What do we got?

783
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
Just about 40 minutes

784
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Let me see

785
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,200
All right, two more questions I got

786
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
Let me do this promo first

787
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,200
Then two more phone calls and I'll play another song for you

788
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Okay, hold on, don't go away

789
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,200
Holy cow, it's a promo

790
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
That'll be the next 30 seconds

791
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Also, you watch this cover and all the new podcast

792
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
Roughly cripple your listening pleasure

793
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
The name of the mod

794
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
Sadler and all this investigation

795
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
What is this nonsense?

796
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,200
I'm random, British is touting

797
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
I so called human, you're down

798
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Well good evening, cynical fans

799
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Actually, it's a really look at the weeks events

800
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
It's the first sketches

801
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
Sounds awesome

802
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,200
Well, perhaps this montage of hilarious movies for the show

803
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
We'll persuade you

804
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,200
Oh, you realize you've already got it to 20 of your 30 seconds

805
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,200
What?

806
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Ah, then the listeners will just understand

807
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
They don't work for it

808
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
The Sadler and all the investigations

809
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Is downright here there

810
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,200
So just pretend you've had some rips floating clips

811
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Whoa, that's right

812
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,200
And that was all gasmig

813
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,200
Where'd I get my hits?

814
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Much better

815
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
Stop by Sadler and Thomas investigations

816
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,200
Stop wordpress.com

817
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,200
That's S-A-T-L-E-R

818
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,200
And T-H-O-M-A-S

819
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Investigations of all one word

820
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,200
Flyby

821
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Stop wordpress.com

822
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
Without flying in the middle

823
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
Or just search for a spy day

824
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,200
But Polkels that we all know

825
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
And tell all your friends about the Polkels

826
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Because it lives a metric house

827
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
So it'll finally directly into your ears

828
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
Hello, my name is Darren

829
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
And I have a podcast on the

830
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,200
Partial systems

831
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
I've just got to help

832
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
If you have the big app system

833
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,200
Which you're all excited about

834
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,200
A one point and we are

835
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
I believe they had a couple of competitions

836
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
You were randomly put

837
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,200
Additional material into certain downloads

838
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
And I know that you're using this

839
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
What I think you're using this system

840
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
For putting the commercials

841
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
Onto the beginning and end of some podcasts

842
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
But just wonder whether

843
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
We like to see any of the patients

844
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,200
They're already stuck there

845
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,200
They're already using this system

846
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,200
All right, I hate when they're going on cellphones

847
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Yeah, that's a good point

848
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
We haven't used that

849
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,200
I mean, we are indeed using it

850
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
You're referring to the golden tickets

851
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Which we did a couple of years ago

852
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
And I think it's a great idea

853
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,200
I'd like to read and state that

854
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,200
Give me a week or two to set it up

855
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,200
The idea is or the execution of the idea

856
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
Because it does work

857
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,200
Is I can predetermine

858
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,200
Any number of shows that are downloaded

859
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
So for instance, this is number 754

860
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
I could say I want 10

861
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,200
10 of these downloads to include an extra piece of audio

862
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,200
Which would indeed be what we call a golden ticket

863
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,200
Which would make you a winner

864
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
We used it very successfully

865
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
I think we gave way in iPod

866
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,200
Did a couple other

867
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,200
I think there were some other shows

868
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,200
That used it

869
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
The problem is it's all still manual configuration

870
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
And it really needs to have some kind of interface

871
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
The most beautiful thing would be

872
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
If we could actually set it up

873
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,200
So that you could

874
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Insert a golden ticket yourself

875
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,200
Determine how many etc

876
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,200
There's some scaling issues there

877
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
That we would have to look at first

878
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,200
But even people who tried to gain the system

879
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
We're unable to

880
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,200
It's a good call man

881
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
I'll look into that

882
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
See if we can do some fun with golden tickets again

883
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
Hey Adam

884
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,200
It's Tim from Boucher

885
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Tim Able from Boucher

886
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,200
Just listening to your latest shows

887
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,200
And you mentioned that you think you're having your perfect site

888
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
And you go really fast download

889
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
And then it drops right off

890
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
Now I've noticed

891
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
At the heavier that I think

892
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
You can blame the browser for

893
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,200
If you start

894
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
If you click on a download link

895
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,200
For a big file

896
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
And then you spend a while passing around

897
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
Just finding way to save it

898
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,200
And that kind of thing

899
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,200
When it finally pops up

900
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
The downloading dialogue

901
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,200
I think it calculates the speed wrong

902
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
I think it

903
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,200
Those the data that it sounds like fall

904
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,200
When it's already started downloading the background

905
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,200
But the time from when you finished passing around

906
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,200
So you get this ridiculously false download speed

907
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,200
And then it means closer to the real download speed

908
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
Yeah, okay, good point

909
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,200
But that's actually I was looking at my traffic

910
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,200
Within with a packet monitor

911
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,200
So I'm not looking at the

912
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,200
You can't trust that little meter on your browser

913
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
Now I'll give you all kinds of wacky results

914
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
No, I actually see the throughput

915
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,200
Through the internet

916
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,200
Through the the Nick card

917
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,200
As I know the network interface card

918
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,200
And I can see it happening

919
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,200
I particularly in the condo

920
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,200
Where I'm on

921
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,200
Comcast

922
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,200
You'll see stuff come in

923
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,200
Like 10 megabits per second

924
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,200
And then all sort of

925
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,200
Oh, it slows down to like

926
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,200
You know one or whatever

927
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,200
And uploads the same thing

928
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,200
You know I can see it do a

929
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,200
Megabit per second up

930
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,200
And then all of a sudden it starts slow down

931
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,200
It hangs around

932
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
4 to 500

933
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,200
Kill a bit upload

934
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,200
And I'm not quite sure

935
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,200
I don't know if that's the way

936
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
That's the behavior of

937
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,200
Interface cards

938
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,200
Or it just feels to me like something is being shaped

939
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,200
I'd love to have us of on checking on that

940
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,200
Let me know what the score is

941
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,200
Des Bartlett said to Adam

942
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,200
I heard what your shows you said you wanted to hear some protest on

943
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,200
Well, I found one from the pod save music network

944
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,200
He says it's called snapback to reality

945
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Done by the undercover hippie perfect

946
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,200
For this source code

947
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,200
7-5-4

948
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,200
Don't know what it's coming to

949
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,200
But I see the world through different

950
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,200
I just lit it

951
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
So he's like we're coming through

952
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,200
So many of us who are visual

953
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,200
It's going crazy

954
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,200
People amazed me

955
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,200
Act so hasty

956
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Rest a minute

957
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
Then they call you lazy

958
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,200
Whilst the game

959
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
We've gone insane

960
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,200
We're chasing money

961
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,200
Till it brings us pain

962
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,200
And it's so plain to see

963
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,200
That we need to

964
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,200
Snap back to reality

965
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,200
On it's so plain to see

966
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,200
That we need to

967
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,200
Snap back, snap back

968
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,200
To reality

969
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,200
Snap back in my living room

970
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,200
Looking at the TV

971
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,200
Telling me I want to wear around

972
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,200
Dreaming up another day

973
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,200
When I get away from the walls

974
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,200
That keep me there

975
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,200
Why do I care about

976
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,200
So wonder where I'm

977
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,200
The reasons that I sit and stare

978
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,200
To the scene that I'm just green

979
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,200
I long to live inside the TV

980
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,200
Dreaming

981
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,200
It's so plain to see

982
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,200
That we need to

983
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,200
Snap back to reality

984
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,200
On it's so plain to see

985
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,200
That we need to

986
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,200
Snap back, snap back

987
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,200
To reality

988
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
Don't see who represents me

989
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,200
Not the TV, not my MP

990
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,200
Not the MC, not the MTV

991
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,200
Talk to me, not the MC

992
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,200
Well it's talkin' about cash

993
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,200
Ego plenty

994
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,200
Ego's in trick and then Ego's in trick

995
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,200
Make me feel sick but come for them

996
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,200
From my dancing mind

997
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,200
Dreaming up another day

998
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,200
When I get away from the walls

999
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,200
That keep me there

1000
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,200
Leave it to reality

1001
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,200
Don't leave it to not free

1002
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,200
Don't be the coach

1003
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,200
Nobody got a cold

1004
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,200
Wake it up

1005
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,200
Just keep on planting my seed

1006
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,200
Positive and see

1007
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,200
Because I believe that

1008
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,200
I'm taking it free and I'm taking it my mind

1009
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,200
Making it see and I'm taking it this world

1010
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,200
Making us feel as if the reality back till is real

1011
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,200
I'm taking it my life

1012
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,200
Making it free and I'm taking it my mind

1013
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,200
Making it see and I'm taking it this world

1014
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,200
Making us feel as if the reality back till is real

1015
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,200
Back till is real, back till is real

1016
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,200
The superficiality back till is real

1017
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,520
Don't know what's coming to

1018
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,120
But I think I might know what was coming from

1019
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,980
You'll know what we're gonna do

1020
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,800
And I think I might know what we're gonna go

1021
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,980
And around crafting

1022
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,340
You'll know what is coming to

1023
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:11,340
But I think I might know where was coming from

1024
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,180
Don't know what we're gonna do

1025
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:23,820
But I think I might know where we're going around

1026
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:35,820
