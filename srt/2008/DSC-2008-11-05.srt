1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Delta Shira Charlie 803, ladies and gentlemen, we have a new president.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
For $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the next generation radio contenting my ears.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I like to think I'm flying into this journey.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I guess it is an ugly gory.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Everybody look around.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Because there's a reason to reach out to see you.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Everybody look around.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And there's a hope that we've been waiting home.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Everybody call me.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We don't need you.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't want you to talk about me.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Can't we? No!

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Can't we? No, can't.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Can't we?

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Can't we? No!

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And what a big wave, full sign is shining, jump over us.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And what do we know?

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And just a moment there are two of you guys.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Wow!

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's like a different way out in the distance now.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's like the world.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We don't know if we've been reachin' home.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We've fallen in.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And so the moment we find it, but we...

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's not to try.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The place is so interesting,

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We don't really feel that it's so tough for me.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Just like the moment you're in the distance,

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't know if we've been reachin' home.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Just like that,

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Can we live?

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can we live?

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Can we live?

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Can we live?

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Can we live?

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Can we live?

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Can we live?

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Can we live?

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Because the sun is shining, you're fine

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Everybody wake up into the morning and do a happy day

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hello, hello!

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's like a different way out here than now

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In the world, we always know that we've been free so far

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We've been calling me

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's how the world is, we thought it was me

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's not your turn

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We're as if you're only thinking about me

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We're only thinking about what's in your soul

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Tell me the moment

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If only I was directing the show last night

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This is the something that would have played

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
When Barack Obama was on stage accepting

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The presidency of the United States

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That would have made it perfect

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The win stars

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Brand new day kickin off

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Daily source code episode number eight hundred and three

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We have a brand new president in the United States of America

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
In the United States of America, Barack Hussein Obama

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And I could not be more pleased for a number of reasons first of all

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm always very happy when I see my fellow countrymen

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And what a diverse bunch we are

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
When I see them really bonding together, really happy

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Extremely emotional about the success of Barack Obama

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The success of his campaign and becoming president

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He's the stuff that dreams are made of

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Certainly in the United States of America

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And regardless of who would have won this election

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
When a country gets behind something like that

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
At least this is the way I was brought up

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're right along on board

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We give up our differences

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We don't hold a grudge, we're good sportsmen

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And we support our president

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Because everyone deserves a clean shot

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And I'm also extremely happy

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That America really got what it wanted

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Without any shenanigans apparently

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No seeming shenanigans going on at the polling booth

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The large majority of the vote

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And we got the whole the whole kitten caboodle

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We've got the house, the senate, the executive branch

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is exactly what America wanted

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
For that I'm extremely happy

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And I want to ride this wave of euphoria for as long as it lasts

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The only another hour because joblessness

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The ADP

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Unemployment numbers are coming out in a couple hours

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But regardless I want to ride that

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Because when this country

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Even though I'm not in it right now

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
When America really bonds together like that

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is when we can make great things happen

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Now am I happy that

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The Barack won

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well no I wouldn't have been happy

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
John McCain won either

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I believe that both of those candidates

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
are being essentially run by people in the background

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And on this program we discuss many of those names

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's funny how the name Briginski is still

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Not really appearing in the mainstream media

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Even though the comparisons are being made

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
To the last time a Democrat won the landslide

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Which was Jimmy Carter in that 70

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't want to say 73

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Maybe it's 78

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm just not old enough to know actually

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But yet no connection

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
As seeing as Briginski was heavily involved in the Carter campaign

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And we should look at the outcome of that presidency

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So I'm digging it

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I really am

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And this may sound weird to a lot of Europeans

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But this is exactly the way we responded

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
America after a presidential election

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hey

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That guy won the one that you were for

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I was against doesn't matter he's our president

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We're going to support him we're going to let him

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Take the shot

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And do the best he can now of course

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What's really cool about this new age

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Much better than even 2004 although we were pretty connected at the time

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Is we really have a good flow of information

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We have aggregation of mainstream new stories such as

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Drop.io slash daily source code

130
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We can follow along

131
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We have a full set of plans from a Barack Obama and Joe Biden

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
A full set of plans on every single topic that they are going to tackle

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And if you haven't read this yet

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I suggest you do it's of importance now

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's no longer about it but about a campaign

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This will be put into effect

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And I'm taking a lot of these words quite literally

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So I will be keeping a very sharp look out on a number of issues

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Mainly doubling up our troops in Afghanistan

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Doubling up our homeland security

141
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
All kinds of internet cyber

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Initiatives to be taken also under the guise of anti-terrorism

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And homeland security

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Sounds a lot like what we've had for the past

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Past couple of years but it could change

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's what has been promised us above all

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Change and hope

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well that part we've got down pat we're good to go

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
If you want more of an analysis on the election

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Definitely listen to Noah agenda

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Johnson to work and I recorded an episode this morning

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It was early for me around

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
8 a.m.

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Well I was up much earlier of course to prep for the show

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And for John it was midnight

156
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So it was kind of a very unbalanced recording for us

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And still we managed to do like 75 minutes

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't know how we get away with this shit

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So we'll just launch right into it

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
There's still a lot of things not going well in the world

161
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And these are the things that we hope

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We'll change and I think we should be right there

163
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hounding our our incumbent

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Representatives and the new ones coming in

165
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I really don't have much view on who's coming yet

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I haven't really had time to focus on that

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But there's lots of changes this is not just about the president of the United States

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But really about a lot of the governing bodies

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And it is quite spectacular that it will be completely

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Demercratically run now is it all really one party

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Are there different fractions within the party

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Who's a good guy and who's not a good guy

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Because I think there's good guys and gals and bad guys and gals

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And we'll see how the the puppet masters continue to

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Tug it the strings in the background

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And if we really get what we want

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So far so good step one has been taken again

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I could not be happier for America

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Adam this is Chris in the world

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm Louisiana USA

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I was turned on to the DSC through no agenda

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This led to finding out about Ron Paul and all that he stands for

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Unfortunately, he's not on the ballot in many states

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But I wanted to let you in color charcoal right now

185
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But I just voted for him

186
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I know he won't win but the lever was pulled as a matter of principle

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This wouldn't have occurred

188
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Had the DSC not turned me on to the scams at the major candidates

189
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
They're trying to pull on the American people and the people of the world

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Thanks for waking me up to the idea

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What freedom really is?

192
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're a modern day Thomas Jefferson

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And as he once said

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time

195
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
With a blood of patriots and tyrants

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Guess what Adam the tree of liberty is getting thirsty

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Great hair, hope you land scruncher

198
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Prostate cancer prevention court and met in full

199
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh lovely

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Keep up the good work

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And the DSC is a no agenda

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Don't come along

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And actual Ron Paul voters signing out

204
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Alright man, thank you so much

205
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yes, Ron Paul was on the ballot in many states

206
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And this is another thing that is really important to understand

207
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That it's not about winning or losing necessarily

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You know as you already stated

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You know that Ron Paul when you pulled the lever

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You knew the Ron Paul could not win

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But that's not what it's about

212
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The freedom, the liberty movement

213
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The awakening is something that is millions across

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Probably across America alone

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Certainly millions across the globe

216
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
People are waking up to the true reality of what's happening

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And it's something you're right

218
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Or I guess Thomas Jefferson was right

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You know the tree gets thirsty

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He's to be replenished from time to time

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And we continue to

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Drop us much water onto the roots of the tree as possible

223
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And even those votes for Ron Paul

224
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Which do not matter in the

225
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Who wins part of the election

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But really what do we stand for is extremely important

227
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Also something I noticed which was very prevalent on the BBC

228
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
They're coverage which I watched a lot of just to see how it's being reported over here

229
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It really truly you get the feeling like you have to be with the winner

230
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's like that many people are picking the winner

231
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Instead of voting their conscience and for who think they think can actually represent their views the most

232
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And really run the country

233
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's the chief executive which of course is analogous to the chief executive officer of

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Any company any corporation

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So who can run it I'll tell you one thing whoever was running that campaign can run a lot of things very well

236
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That was well managed no one no one in their right mind can say that that wasn't done just spectacularly well

237
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Let's just make sure we don't get hypnotized into

238
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Approving things that we don't really approve of in our heart of hearts just because it's done so strictly because remember

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Television which was really what this

240
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Election was about it was how the media and I'll just say television because television was so important

241
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Television plays a lot of tricks on you when you just when you think a reality show is real

242
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's really isn't and they may even call it unscripted drama, but it really isn't this was also not without its script

243
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Would they deviated from the script from time to time they made it into a very good show

244
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But at the end of the day compared to a movie and this played out like a movie

245
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It even came in on time it wasn't like you know a four hour saga

246
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It really wasn't like an hour and fifty minute movie jammed into two years and it ended beautifully with

247
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's why I said I would have put the wisdom stars on when Obama was on stage

248
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That would have completed that would have made it so beautiful people would have been you fork and dancing everybody knows the song

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It ended perfectly roll credits and now we're about to leave the movie theater

250
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And we're going to talk about the movie for a couple days and then pretty soon

251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
We're going to get back to our jobs and get back to our lives

252
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And then we're going to see how much this movie impacts us and it still will be several months before

253
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
President elect Obama becomes full blown president

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Hey Adam, this is Joey from Spotain, Washington

255
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And I just wanted to let you know I cast my vote and I have an hard time saying hello before

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You know I don't keep it politics too much but I still vote and I voted for Obama which was not

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You know they're not the preferred for me

258
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But I really hope that Ron Paul would be in the running

259
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But I know I could have voted for Chuck Baldwin as well

260
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But it was just a little bit hard decision

261
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But I just wanted to let you know that I'm a very long time listener

262
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And since we were born before iTunes and when you had to actually go get the podcast yourself

263
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And may not be pretty much your iPods

264
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So very long time often on the business of my first time calling so I'm like a good cat with kind of

265
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes my anyways

266
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah I listen to the show all the time

267
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I you know no matter what it's always a good show and I find it very interesting

268
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You know I could pick up after 10 episodes that not listen to and then again

269
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
There's another good show you know full bar fried dinner great

270
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You're in a good job and you know I just wanted to call for the first time in

271
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You know how many years after listening to your show

272
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Anyways

273
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yes, like as you're I guess up to the election and see what you got to say

274
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Anyways

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Take care of them. They work for us right on them. They sure do and we're going to keep keep reminding them of that

276
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And I appreciate you coming out and voting

277
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Even though you didn't vote for the candidate of my choice just to make it clear

278
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Since everyone's being so nice and sharing I did not vote for Barack Obama

279
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I did not vote for John McCain I voted for Chuck Baldwin for two reasons

280
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Because I certainly did not have enough time to vet him the way I've vetted other candidates

281
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
One is in essence I'm a constitutionalist. I think it's a very simple

282
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Document very easy to follow. It fits in your shirt pocket

283
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's one 1000s of a size of the US tax code these days. It's a very simple system

284
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's not necessarily a system that makes it easy for everybody

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But then again no one said life was fair

286
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And it was set up by the founding fathers a great great grand experiment and a number of things have gone awry

287
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Over the years most notably the central banking system in the United States known as the federal reserve that was

288
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
We've deviated from the way the constitution stipulates that through a number of legal loopholes

289
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The federal reserve act was created accepted and some say ratified by most states

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And that is really the root of a lot of the the evil that we're running into because once you control the money

291
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You don't even need to make the laws in a country you just need to be able to control the money supply

292
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Which is exactly what the central banks do

293
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So to wind it up because there are a lot more stuff to talk about today

294
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Here's what I'll be keeping my eye on at the top of the page Obama's comprehensive tax policy plan for America

295
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And here's so it starts off with the we all know this by now

296
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The news media never gets further than cut taxes for 95% of workers and their families with a tax code of $500 for workers or 1000 for working couples

297
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
This is the what many are calling the socialist move

298
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Excuse me, it doesn't make me burp a little bit when I read it

299
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
To provide generous tax cuts for low and middle income seniors homeowners the uninsured and family sending a child to college

300
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Or looking to save and accumulate wealth

301
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Understood, I think that also hit home with a lot of people in those situations and here's the here's the two

302
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That actually the one

303
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Because I'll read you number four dramatically simplify taxes by consolidating existing tax credits eliminating the need for millions of senior citizens to file tax forms

304
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And enabling as many as 40 million middle class Americans to do their own taxes and less than five minutes without an accountant

305
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Boy, oh boy

306
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I wish I could do that

307
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But here's the one that I'm keeping my eye on that I'm most excited about and it's a promise it's the top of the page and I'm going to hold the new administration to it

308
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses cut corporate taxes for firms that invest and create jobs in the United States

309
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Which I do and provide tax credits to reduce the cost of health care which we provide and to reward investments in innovation

310
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes, that to me is a fantastic

311
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And I can't wait until that's enacted and I will keep bitching and moaning about it until I get my piece of the pie as well damn it because ladies and gentlemen be proud to be an American and witness this historic moment for the first time in US history

312
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
We got a black man in the White House

313
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
We got a black man in the White House

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000

358
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But ain't your guess black right to like this is full choice

359
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I pledge allegiance to the flag being all I could never be

360
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000

They got me seeing stars from the club is straight from the whip

364
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Why am I strong be like that? I ain't into politics

399
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,280
an intellectual election falls at the same time. So let's talk about that more

400
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:53,520
bonfires tonight though. I'm sure. That's what we do here in the UK. Look

401
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,360
it up. Look it up. Guy Fox day. Speaking of the drop, hey, we're up with the

402
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,480
with the, with the porn down under everybody. The Australian porn is like

403
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,760
this seems like there's one porn star in all of Australia. And she's not that

404
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,240
hot. And her movies are not awesome either. And you know, please don't go

405
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,880
polluting the drop. Just sense stuff to me directly. Because I always had a

406
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,680
very different idea of Australian porn. I thought it was going to be better.

407
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,240
I digress. There's a lot going on in particular financial crisis. We have to

408
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,480
keep our eyes on this because the real economy is in trouble. And it's being

409
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,080
hidden behind what's going on in Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial

410
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,400
index is pretty much now seen as the daily thermometer for how the

411
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,440
economy is doing. That is not true. And I measured by completely different

412
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,840
standards. One of the things we've been talking about for the past couple

413
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,600
episodes here in the Chuck is credit card use. And how, well, this is my theory

414
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,160
that when lots of people start using credit cards at McDonald's, that

415
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,840
pretty much means that you're buying food on credit. That's just the way I

416
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,280
see it. And it's questionable as to whether you're actually buying food or

417
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,640
not the nutritional value of what most people buy in the

418
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,680
McDonald's is obviously questionable at very best. So we have a couple of

419
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:18,960
comments. How do you see in Oregon making a comment on the DSC show 802,

420
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:27,440
especially the person Doug Criter who made a comment on the credit card. I guess

421
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,720
the stigma that's attached to him by the old folks. I never thought I'd be old at 42.

422
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,600
Yeah, dude. I hear you. I got the same stigma issue and I'm 44. But I think I am old.

423
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:45,280
But, well, that's how it's looked upon. He said his dad frown when he pulled out his

424
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,760
credit card to pay for his latte or whatever it was.

425
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,120
Not a big reason seeing his back in the day it used to be that if you didn't have

426
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,840
money in your pocket or your last resort was to pay with a credit card and that was

427
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,520
kind of frowned upon because you had to pay not only the interest rate on the charge,

428
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:11,120
but the transaction fees now. Look at how much each transaction cost you.

429
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,920
You know, this is interesting because when I first started in the official big

430
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:24,400
big world television in 1980, were two, three, I'll say 83, can't even remember.

431
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:30,000
I remember going to Los Angeles with the producer, actually with the executive producer to

432
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,320
do a number of interviews. Actually, he went to the states. We went to talk to CZZ top in

433
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:41,840
Texas. We did Michael Jackson in New York. They were doing the Jackson 5 tour

434
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:50,480
and Madonna in Los Angeles. She was just breaking through huge.

435
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,520
And there were no credit cards. At the time, I think I might have had a diners card.

436
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,800
I can't really remember for whatever reason. No, and I didn't have any credit card. That's true

437
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,640
because we went to the United States and in this executive producer literally had

438
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,600
wads of cash. And the hotel, of course, the credit card culture had been really

439
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,040
already been entrenched in the US. The hotel really didn't know what to do with us. You know,

440
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,760
this, well, you have to pay like a thousand bucks upfront. You know, we'll deduct it from the

441
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,880
bill at the end. But, you know, we can't just let you pay, you know, we need to assurance

442
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,600
as in case you do a runner on us or something like that. This is really only come to be

443
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,920
these discredit card mentality and the switch from paper to plastic, which is where we're going.

444
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:40,080
And I got to say, although I'm against the government being able to track everything because

445
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,520
of course, we know now with the Pfizer, the new Pfizer bill, which President electobama signed on

446
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,400
every single credit card transaction that has made in the United States or through United

447
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:57,760
States entity is reported to the government. For our protection, of course, to make sure no

448
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:05,760
one's financing terrorism. Otherwise, I do like the whole idea of things being seamless.

449
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,800
Patricia is completely hooked on it. Now, we don't really, we have, we do have a credit card

450
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:16,800
for one of our banks, which is only there. In case there's a large purchase that needs to be made

451
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:23,440
or an emergency, obviously. And we pretty much do everything on a bank debit card just because,

452
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,680
you know, there's like there's no confusion at the end of the day. You know, you charge,

453
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,960
you buy something. It's taken off of your account immediately and there's no fees, et cetera.

454
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,520
It's as good as cash. Unfortunately, everything's being recorded. I hate that.

455
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,200
And I mix it up a lot, just a mess with them. You know, I'll buy things weird things and weird

456
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,840
places and put that on the card and other things I'll pay for cash with, just to throw them off a

457
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:56,640
little bit. And Patricia always falls into this trap. You know, so she got a, you know, they offered

458
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,120
her at what's a store is it? I'm looking for the envelope here because I always get pissed off and we always

459
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,000
have an old-on argument, but we always talk about this and I say, look, this is just the pain in

460
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,040
the ass, this is how they do it. One of the department stores, I can't remember which one,

461
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,800
and one of the mid to upscale department stores. And they, you know, of course, they hate say,

462
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,480
hey, if you get it, one, if you get our card, then you can get all kinds of discounts and bonuses.

463
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,680
And Patricia shops there a lot and she's thinking, yeah, okay, I'll do that because, you know,

464
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:31,760
I don't care spending less. And I always tell her, no, no, no, because the only way it works

465
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,760
if you use the card and it's not just a loyalty card, it's a credit card. And then you get all these

466
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,680
fees and charges and, you know, that I have to make sure that it's paid on time. So it's a pain in the

467
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:49,760
ass. And it's run by GE money. So what do you think GE money is in the business of making money?

468
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,520
So they're doing this. And then we're going to get more junk mail and more offers and more administration

469
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,760
hated, hated, hated. Anyway, I digress, let's get back to the DSC in Oregon.

470
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:10,560
Here we go. Not only is the store retail outlet, you're paying, using that credit card out,

471
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:16,960
being charged, you're also paying a charge to use it. Then you're paying a transaction fee,

472
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,560
you know, when it goes and gets processed by whatever credit agency is issuing use that card.

473
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:29,280
And then they take interest up on top of that. Same thing was even the debit cards these days.

474
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:37,280
You pay a fee to get out your money from your or bank. Yeah, not always. I got Barclays here in the

475
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,960
UK, which we use for the debit card. And there's no charge in 99% of the cases. I'm pretty happy with

476
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,960
if you don't have to be close to one of your. By the way, Barclays Bank, the only bank that said,

477
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,160
no, thank you to the government bailout in the United Kingdom and went and raised money elsewhere.

478
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,120
Good on you guys. Don't be passing off any shit to them.

479
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,080
Or ATMs at your bank runs, even though they run all on the same network. It's kind of funny.

480
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,840
You can pay anywhere from 50 cents to $10 for a transaction, not including if you're overseas.

481
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:17,520
Then you pay also a conversion fee. Oh, it's all just credit. Anyway, at least these days.

482
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:23,360
So that's a reason is because if you didn't have, you know, at least $50 in your wallet,

483
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,720
what the heck were you buying? Why were you buying it?

484
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,360
Well, so those are all excellent points. And we did have more comments that I want to get to about

485
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,920
using credit cards, which are equally using. Hey, Adam, John and Oma, hey, I'm checking in on that

486
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:41,280
comment you made about the credit cards being at the fast food joints. Yeah, everybody wants to

487
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,920
release the banks and those kind of financial institutions. Once this is stopped, notice

488
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,560
they're using cash. Just use the plastic credits that we get. And then who knows what kind of

489
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:58,000
currency we're using? That's sort of thing. I thought it was interesting. Something I heard a few

490
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,920
years ago back is a radio financial guide named Dave Ramsey. You are used to listen to and

491
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:10,960
that's a good advice from. You're just a personal finance type of issues. But he always slammed

492
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,680
the credit card companies and the banks are pushing on the credit, you know, all this huge amounts

493
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,760
of credit on the people. And one thing that he came across was study done by Visa International.

494
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,160
I did some Googling around and I was able to find an article in the Wall Street Journal

495
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:33,120
dated back in November 26th, 2002. And in this here's a little paragraph. It says,

496
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,680
well, the chains that take credit cards do have to pay fees to credit card companies.

497
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:43,200
Those fees are offset by test results that indicate consumers spend more when they charge.

498
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,360
Indeed, a Visa USA study released this month showed that the average fast food transaction

499
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:55,840
with credit cards was 20 to 30 percent higher than cash. Subway says the average credit

500
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,760
trend section has doubled to $9 since the chain started to roll out cards three years ago.

501
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,360
So there you have it. I think one of the big issues, at least when we start talking about using

502
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:14,160
credit everywhere, you know, whether being a vending machine at the fast food joint doesn't

503
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,000
matter where. When you pull out that credit card, instead of cash, you don't actually understand

504
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,320
how much you spend, and it seems like it's okay to spend a little bit more because it doesn't

505
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:30,080
hurt you so bad. And of course, the banks making out more money in this way, that sort of thing.

506
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:36,400
One thing also that popped up, I think earlier this gene where a chain or 2008 of a year ago,

507
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:44,240
the government decided to stop printing Social Security checks instead give out debit cards

508
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,320
to those people who receive Social Security benefits. There you go. Kind of a change there too,

509
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:56,720
and again, the kind of gets back to, if somebody is getting a credit or getting a

510
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,360
usually get it's a check, but now gets this debit card. Maybe they don't want to debit card.

511
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,960
Maybe they don't use credit cards and they don't trust banks, and so they don't want to get this

512
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:11,040
check and cash and keep this money for themselves. But yet, no, we can't do that. The banks are

513
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,280
once again forcing this little credit card thing on us. You know, again, we don't really know what

514
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,760
the balance is behind it. The funny money that goes on behind it, that sort of thing, it's just

515
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,200
plastic credits credits credits credits that keep you going that kind of thing. So anyway,

516
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,560
I've started past that along to you and keep up the great work. Thanks, out dude.

517
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,720
Yeah, I appreciate the music you edited under that, too. It makes it harder for me to interrupt

518
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,960
you, but that's kind of keep the show moving. Yeah, and there's even, there's commercials now

519
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:49,360
where you see someone, this is the whole paper to plastic move that is big, and it's going to be

520
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,920
very, very fundamental because once we move away from the paper money, it makes it that much easier

521
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:00,320
to create more, to control the money supply, and control your personal freedom almost, I'd say,

522
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,400
I mean, notice you never get a debit card that has like an indicator on it or a number that says,

523
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,000
how much money you have less. Yeah, I think there's many of them you can carry around some kind of

524
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,400
device, and then you can see how much is, if it's a, if it's stored on the chip is some countries

525
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,480
in Europe have that, where you can actually load up the card itself, but you can't tell. I mean,

526
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,760
it's different from a wallet, right? You look in the wallet, you can see how much you have left,

527
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,240
and it's very easy to slip from your debit into your credit on a card, on a plastic

528
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,040
system, but it's totally where we're, we're moving towards. Gone are the days of nothing

529
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:41,040
under five bucks, you know, it's like you can put anything you want on your, on your plastic. In the

530
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,000
meantime, following some of the mainstream news articles, and of course, all of these are listed

531
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,960
in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com, crossposts at curry.com, first article here about

532
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,800
banks clamping down on credit cards, the name credit card issuers, including Bank of America,

533
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,560
Chase, American Express are shrinking instead of raising credit limits, and some including

534
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,720
Chase are closing some accounts. American Express will notify its card members in the coming weeks

535
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:17,200
that will initiate a broad-based interest rate, height rate, height, height, height, which means

536
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:24,080
moving interest rates up, not down, even though we're now at a basis rate of 1%,

537
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:31,840
your rates are going to go up even further on your credit cards. Just think about how crazy that is.

538
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:43,600
Average rate on a variable rate card did fall from 13.64% to 11.37% last week in comparison to the

539
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:52,080
same time a week ago, but still 13, even 11%, I mean, when the basic rate is 1%, what is happening?

540
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:57,680
Where's all the money? Of course, you know where the money is. It's being held up by Paulson's

541
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:04,000
buddies. He gave it to all his friends. They're holding on to it. Donald Trump this morning on

542
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,800
CNBC, he was on with Jack Welch, he called in. They were talking about the election, and Trump said

543
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,840
I'm paraphrasing but getting pretty close to his quote, said, it doesn't matter how good a business

544
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,360
you have, how big a business you are, how fantastic the deal is, real estate doesn't make any

545
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:30,240
difference. You cannot get alone. And this is the guy who knows how it works because Donald Trump

546
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,040
works with other people's money. That's his business. And he's literally saying you can't get

547
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,120
alone. So he's the I'm very disappointed. You know, $700 billion initially, now well over truly

548
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:46,320
and maybe as high as three, has gone into the banking system, and they're not even letting it

549
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,720
trickle down to people like Donald Trump. You know, it's completely hose when they're doing that.

550
00:39:51,520 --> 00:40:01,600
So, oh, man, I can't wait to see who Obama appoints as Secretary of the Treasury. Right now,

551
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:08,560
it's Hank Paulson, former Goldman Sachs CEO already in the same piece this morning, John Corsine,

552
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:15,360
who is the governor for New Jersey, is being said to be shortlisted to become the treasure

553
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,680
of the Secretary of the Treasury. And guess what? And I put a link to his wiki page in the show

554
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:29,120
notes. He is also a former CEO of Goldman Sachs. Just goes to show the more things change

555
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,440
the more they remain the same. Hello Adam, this is Chris and so it does. I'm going to call

556
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:42,400
an Arnold global climate change for you. Yeah, I grew up in New York. I got a lot of these. I got a

557
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,720
lot of people not not agreeing with me on this, which is good, because at least you're sending

558
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,600
your comments in audio. We agree on the climate change. Well, for the six of our U.S. has

559
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:59,760
pretended not before we pretend anything. First of all, let's recall that this was called

560
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,760
global warming. All right, I have not forgotten. This was global warming is what this was called

561
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,640
and global warming is that we were all going to die. It was going to heat up greenhouse gases

562
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:20,000
in particular CO2 carbon dioxide, which trees and plants used to breathe, where we exhale,

563
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,680
they inhale. It's a beautiful balance. It's one of the four elements of life. Most importantly,

564
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,960
of course, being the sun, a pretty much uncontrollable ball of explosions and atomic energy and

565
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:38,480
flares and god knows what else is going on, not exactly a nice round even ball that could perhaps

566
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:45,680
affect change to a move from global warming to all crap. That's not exactly true. It's not just

567
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,720
getting warmer. It's actually getting colder. Let's just call it climate change. So that's where I'll

568
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,160
start. We change the name and I happen for cotton. Global,

569
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:09,360
I'm not pretending. Of course it's happening. Very, very miniscule amounts, but yes, of course

570
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,840
it's happening. It's been happening throughout history. Climate change has been taking place.

571
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:18,240
That's the most ridiculous. I mean, you should have kept it at global warming. You could probably

572
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,760
fool more people by continuing to call it global warming and point out places where it's getting

573
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,640
warmer than to issue, to usher in climate change, not buying it. Of course, it's taking place.

574
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,280
But the reasons why and how we're combating it, that's what I have an issue with. And I was

575
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:42,480
wondering, what kind of evidence or charismatic people does it take to, um, oh, it's clear that

576
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,320
with charismatic people, you can teach them anything and you can tell them anything and they'll

577
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,280
take it and they'll believe it. I mean, that was just proven. So I don't listen to charismatic

578
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,360
people. I tried to do my own research and look into it and question what is being handed to me

579
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:06,560
by the government and certainly when something is being handed to me like the IPCC report from

580
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:12,960
the United Nations, I just tend to question things. The proof that, oh wait, this could be a problem.

581
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,080
We've been burning fossil fuels for, you know, over a hundred years, millions of turns of coal

582
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:24,000
and oil and stuff. How can that possibly have no effect on weather? That's a, that's a lot of

583
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,280
B to use ahead in the atmosphere. I don't know. Okay. So let's just make it very clear. I'm not against

584
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,360
taking responsibility for what we're doing to our planet. I'm not against, um, um,

585
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:43,200
in fact, I would love and I'm a huge proponent of new forms of energy. I've done a lot of research

586
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,840
on the show as well into nuclear energy, clean coal technology and also some of the esoteric

587
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,960
energies. Oh, no, dude. I am so convinced that there's something else out there and that it's just

588
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,880
useless. In fact, it is part of the root of all of our problems on this earth. If the energy

589
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,440
elite were not to suppress all other forms of, of fantastic, um, clean, completely clean,

590
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,920
slash renewable energy. We'd been a whole different situation. No doubt about it. And I'm all

591
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,640
for, you know, this, this plenty of people I know who are working on very hard and research and

592
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,680
execution as well on all, and crazy shit, you know, we're getting into hydroxy boosters and

593
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:30,960
joe cells and magnet magnets and I love it. You know, I study Tesla. Anything I can read about this guy.

594
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:40,800
I, I gobble up because yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. But do I have the arrogance to think that humanity

595
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,160
in the thousand, a couple thousand years that that man has walked upright on this earth that we can

596
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:52,000
actually kill the earth? No, no, no, no, no, no, the earth has been around and has dealt with

597
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:00,720
much crazier foe than than the human race. Believe me. Oh, man, what an arrogance to think that

598
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:07,440
that we could actually kill mother nature? No, mother nature will kill us when it's time. I'm convinced

599
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:14,000
of that. So yeah, of course, I, I take responsibility. Of course, I don't want crap floating

600
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:24,720
around in the air. But what I do not agree with is lying to people to force laws to use this as

601
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:36,400
a, as a stick to beat us and to penalize us through taxes based upon a best flaky theory of carbon

602
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:43,920
footprints of this stuff called carbon dioxide, which human beings have been exhaling for

603
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:52,560
thousands of years, a part of the four essentials of life, sun, water, oxygen, and of course,

604
00:45:52,560 --> 00:46:00,080
carbon dioxide to help the foliage grow. Trees breathe that stuff. It's really important. A lot of

605
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:10,160
carbon, you know, it just doesn't seem like, doesn't seem insignificant and also carbon credits.

606
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:16,000
I think that if, you know, I wouldn't pass the, you know, the world government to institute

607
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,520
something like that, you know, virtual money is definitely in their plans. But oh, so don't just gloss

608
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:27,280
over it, okay? This cap and trade plan that you hear our new president talking about, that's what

609
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:34,560
is going to come down to. So the cap part means, okay, you can only produce so many or x amount. I'll just

610
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:42,000
say it's x amount of carbon dioxide. And if you're going to produce more, then you'll have to buy

611
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:50,480
pollution credits as what we should call it. Excuse me. Oh, I just polluted a extra carbon dioxide into

612
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:57,200
the air. And that's, it starts with business and then business will pass it down onto you,

613
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:04,800
the consumer. And you're going to be penalized for this phantom stuff which is supposedly killing

614
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,960
us. I think the much more positive way is to put a hell of a lot more energy and resources into

615
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:18,560
coming up with a different form of producing energy. And no one is really serious about that. No one

616
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,920
is seriously tackling that because it's at the bottom of the pyramid. It's the, or the top,

617
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:30,720
however, review it. It is truly the root of the system. The only three true currencies in the world

618
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:42,720
historically speaking are oil. Can you guess the other two? Now, gold and drugs. Okay,

619
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:49,200
oiled, gold and drugs. So it's going to be very hard to get rid of any one of those,

620
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,960
certainly, without increasing the air, the other two. I don't know. It's hard to increase gold. There's

621
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:02,480
only so much so you can see what's left because that is what a lot of the economy runs on.

622
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,000
That's what I would prefer to do instead of being punished and penalized,

623
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:15,920
which eventually will turn into money because there's going to be just randomly chosen amounts.

624
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,120
Here's how money, or they've already done that. Here's how many megatons of carbon dioxide,

625
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:26,320
each country is allowed to produce based on size and population. And you might as well just call that money.

626
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,880
And they'll be trading between countries. Hey, China, you want to pollute a little bit more?

627
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,480
And that's crazy. That's no way to fix a problem. That's a way to benefit and profit from a problem.

628
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,320
And I'm against it. The whole point of our somebody said it's not based on anything. So I don't think

629
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,960
but you have to be able to control the supply of money. That's where those carbon credits come into play.

630
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:54,240
It would, with a indecent to a specific unit like carbon, because then it wouldn't have control over it.

631
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,600
They would have, you know, they'd have the stick with the carbon credits.

632
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:02,000
Yeah, no, they have control over it because they, they, the mystical they,

633
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,840
who are probably meeting on the 15th, for the new Bretton Woods agreement,

634
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:14,240
more about that later in the show, they will control how many carbon units can be or will be

635
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,880
allowed to be released into the atmosphere. Okay. So that's where they get to control the supply.

636
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,480
I think that's a little hole in the motives. You mean you got motives and you got means, but

637
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:33,680
you still need evidence. The, all the evidence I see that, that does exist.

638
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:40,240
You know, some people I trust, all the evidence that I hear that doesn't exist from people.

639
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:46,400
We're like, oh, what about science? Science is about discussion, but only one person in a room of a thousand

640
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:53,680
he says that there's, there's something going on here. I don't know. Follow the money sees who gets paid by whom

641
00:49:53,680 --> 00:50:02,000
and I'll figure it out. Okay. That's it. Exactly. Now exactly. Follow the money. That's what we're going to do.

642
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:08,880
And in particular, this new administration will be all over this. And I believe it's,

643
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,400
how do you plan on getting to this yet? But I believe it is on the 15th. Excuse me,

644
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,760
when all the finance ministers gather in, I don't know if they're actually doing it in Bretton Woods

645
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,040
again, which is where the previous system was concocted. So they're going to do it again. They're

646
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,440
going to see, and they may not come out of Bretton Woods too, as that's now being called

647
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:35,040
with an entire system. But you know that all the world leaders are already calling for a new

648
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:40,320
economic order, which is close enough to new world order for me to believe that they're really

649
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:46,160
unfolding some of these plans. And this economic crisis that we're in, it's really, really

650
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,800
hurting. It's hurting a lot of people. It's even in our industry here. I got a

651
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,760
article here from Venture Beat. This is from yesterday.

652
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:02,480
Glam, I'm sure you've heard of Glam, women's site publisher and ad network.

653
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:09,200
It says it's going to further delay payments that it owes to partner publisher starting this month,

654
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:15,920
going up to four months delay in payment four months. And that's pretty spectacular.

655
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:21,280
They must be running on some huge deficit if they have to slip it down to four months. In the meantime,

656
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:27,120
as we know, Donald Trump has said, hey, even I can't get a loan from the banks. Goldman Sachs

657
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,760
according to the mail or links in the show notes, the DailySourceco.com, ready to hand out

658
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,920
seven billion pounds, which is now approximately $11 billion in salaries and bonus packages.

659
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:45,360
After received a, well, about six billion dollars in the bailout, got to love that, huh?

660
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,200
You know, and don't just gloss over this, man. These guys are making money. We're making shit.

661
00:51:53,360 --> 00:52:00,560
Now, here's the Britain Woods article. It's actually taken from what is this site,

662
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:05,440
nakedcapitalism.com. I'll just tell you, give you some of the facts. Just so you know,

663
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,640
I probably has become a mainstay of discourse in the US. It says the upcoming financial summit

664
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,800
set for November 15th and Washington DC is being wrapped in the Britain Woods brand.

665
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,480
When it appears to be a different sort of beast. As a Wall Street Journal story reminds us,

666
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,040
Britain Woods was a three week session amongst 44 countries to establish a new international

667
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:31,040
financial regime. Now, the weekend long gathering by contrast, which is coming up on the 15th,

668
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:35,840
has ambitious but more limited aims and is more likely to produce an agreement to agree that is

669
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,320
a consensus on a few high-level issues and some sort of roadmap for future meetings and

670
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,400
initiatives for developing policies and reforms. So, it probably won't happen overnight,

671
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:50,000
but it is definitely taking place and mark my words. We are going to be punished and it's

672
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:58,560
going to happen through this phantom poorly researched in my opinion, very uncertain historical data

673
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:07,360
mean that we're all going to die because we're using fossil fuel. I just don't buy it. I really don't.

674
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:17,040
Again, I'd like to take responsibility. I think I do take responsibility for Mother Earth.

675
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,880
But man, can't we port our energy, our effort, our resources, and instead of penalizing people

676
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,320
incentivize people to come up with alternatives, that's the way to do it.

677
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:36,720
Hi, Adam. It's Matt from Gamesweasel. On this week's show, I will give you

678
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,600
dead space on the PlayStation 3. I also have you star-ocean first departure on the PSP.

679
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,440
The producers of Skate Hit tell us about their brand new skateboarding game on the Wii

680
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:51,120
and you can win copies of star-ocean for the PSP in our competition. That's all at Gamesweasel.com.

681
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:59,760
Thanks, Matt. Comment about, because this, of course, stems from the piece of YouTube that I

682
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:06,160
played, John Coleman found her co-founder, I think, of the weather channel, who says, hey,

683
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:11,920
this is all bullshit. And he's pretty much saying what I'm saying. In fact, I wonder if I

684
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:18,400
could find this piece, it's four pieces on YouTube. There was one piece standing and this

685
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,360
one I'm looking for is the piece about the polar bear. He has a great quote.

686
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:29,920
I don't know if there's some of these quiet. And clearly, maybe over here, if I can't find it,

687
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:36,160
I'll just tell you what he says is funny. Or it's interesting. Come on YouTube, buffer already.

688
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:43,200
There's a lot to do with the energy received at Earth. And so all of this is the controlling factor

689
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:49,360
of climate on Earth. And if you plot the temperatures of Earth. Okay. You have to go look at that

690
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,840
yourself. But at one point, he says, you know, that horrible picture of the polar bear and it's

691
00:54:53,840 --> 00:55:00,960
little baby cub, which has been misused so many times by, I believe the World Wildlife Fund,

692
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:08,240
even. Actually, one of a scientists who was not credited on the IPCC report, that was his footage

693
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:16,400
of an expedition he took. And just to show you how trickery really works on television, in video

694
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:22,240
in general, that was associated with, oh, there's no more ice and the polar bears are sitting on

695
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:28,800
this little piece of ice. When they actually swam, they swam from a, you know, from wherever

696
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,080
what huge chunk they were on, because they were curious about the researchers and their boat.

697
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:39,200
And that was kind of misused. That video taken turned around. I believe even without the,

698
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:44,160
the owner's permission and used as a, as a sad shot, the polar bears are dying.

699
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:53,440
Whereas there's a lot of proof that, hey, I don't want to go get into it. It doesn't matter.

700
00:55:53,440 --> 00:56:01,200
My stance is clear. I'm against taxing for carbon dioxide, because the next easiest way to

701
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,560
get rid of carbon dioxide is clearly to kill people, because we're exhaling it all the time.

702
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:12,160
It's just a really bad precedent. But still bullshit being called on John Coleman. Here we go.

703
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:21,040
Adam, prison natural. Just listen to 802. And I'm sorry. I'm just going to have to call bullshit on this

704
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:28,960
guy who, so we found a, a channel. I mean, he's talking about global warming like it's the fake. I mean,

705
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:37,200
there's, it is fake because it's not happening. Global warming is not taking place. We're, we're

706
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:42,800
cooling off if anything right now. So, yeah, it may come in and make it a little warmer, but then

707
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:47,280
it may get colder. I mean, that's the history. The earth has not burned up ever before. And again,

708
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,440
the arrogance to think that we couldn't kill the earth. This is it beyond me. Believe me,

709
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:57,920
mother earth kills us first, rock paper scissors. I have to do with look at all the evidence that you

710
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,400
already see of species that are off. Yeah, I'm looking outside another rainy day in London.

711
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,840
The only species getting killed off to that I can see are human beings that live in deserts.

712
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:15,840
Already in danger and have a lot of instinct. You can, you can look at the, the polar ice

713
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,560
calf that's been melting. Well, there's, of course, contrary evidence to that fact. You know,

714
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:29,760
you can look at this, you know, in the past years, there's tons of evidence. Most of the

715
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:35,680
the world's renowned skeptics, they agree with go global warming. Yeah, if you're going to make a

716
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:40,480
statement like that, then you really need to tell me who the skeptics are and you've got a name

717
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,920
and that, so that's, I'm calling, but BS on your BS call out, man, you can't do that. You can't

718
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,080
just say, oh, well, lots of skeptics are turning around. That's horse crap. That means nothing

719
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:55,680
that's no proof. You know, Michael Schermer, even anybody, you ask anybody. All right,

720
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,280
anybody. No, I ask lots of people and they agree with me. I mean, that's horseshoe.

721
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:05,760
Hey, well, um, they will say that it's a real thing and it's a threat. Um, this is, this whole,

722
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:14,240
so called the bonking is coming from the, uh, the people who are the oil business. These guys are

723
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,320
the oil business. Dude, I'm not the oil business. I'm just someone who researchers and I just don't

724
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:24,080
buy into shit immediately. Um, again, I'm all for getting rid of fossil fuel. I think it's horrible,

725
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:31,040
not necessarily for climatological reasons, mainly for humanity and we're being enslaved because we're

726
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:39,040
we're running on oil where there's probably lots of free alternatives out there. That's why I'm against it.

727
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:44,960
I'm really, really against the idea of punishing people and stunting growth and economic

728
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:54,080
flourishing through some unproven carbon credit system, which is not solving anything. It's punishing

729
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:59,120
incentivize. That's what I'm about. One tool, who we, as I said,

730
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:05,040
chocolate heads and you have been fighting against, you know, the oil assholes. These are the guys who

731
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:11,760
have been funding these dickheads who are trying to be bonked, global warming. These are the guys who

732
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:19,920
are, they might have a, you know, credential in front of them, but they're being paid by these oil

733
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:26,400
oil fuckers. Man, don't you see what's happening? Don't you see how plain it is? So what you're

734
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:32,720
doing, and let's just say, okay, it's the oil fuckers, as you call them. Sure. But don't you see

735
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:39,200
you're playing right into their hands with, by accepting this whole carbon credit, this cap and trade,

736
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:46,000
don't you see that that's the mistake? So they're going to win twice. They're going to win on

737
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,640
you using oil, fossil fuels, and they're going to win on taxing you over the use of it. So

738
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:58,960
and I'm going to say that it's not just oil companies. It's the true owners of the earth. They

739
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:07,520
who also benefit from tax money. They just took a trillion of American, they took, uh, was it about

740
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:17,440
750 billion in the UK country with, uh, what is it? A fifth, the amount of people who live in

741
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:25,920
in the United States, they're bailout about the same size. I mean, talk about disgrace and they just

742
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:35,360
gave it to the banks, or to an indirectly, I would say to the oil fuckers. And that's, uh, that's

743
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,080
how they get your money twice. So don't fall for that trap, man. Don't fall for that trap. You are

744
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:45,760
not going to solve anything with carbon credits, cap and trade. You're not going to solve anything,

745
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:53,120
work on free new energy incentives to get rid of oil. That's what you got to fight against,

746
01:00:53,120 --> 01:01:02,000
not, not against him. I mean, I'll believe me later, my friend. I just wanted to let you know,

747
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:08,880
um, maybe he's checking to it. See what this guy is back around. He found it a channel. I mean,

748
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:16,720
so what? I mean, the overwhelming majority of scientists worldwide. That's not true. That is just

749
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:22,800
not true. That is not true. Show me the proof, the overwhelming majority of scientists worldwide.

750
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:29,280
You have any idea how afraid scientists are to talk, because of this, because of the attitude

751
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:34,160
that's being taken, they're afraid that they'll never get another research dollar in their life

752
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,920
if they come out against this. They are beaten into submission the same way will be beaten into

753
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:46,160
submission by cap and trade, which is what we're going to get from President Obama. Say the global

754
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:54,160
warning is real. I'm sure you'll get tons of other calls similar to this and I just wanted to tell

755
01:01:54,240 --> 01:02:00,480
you might be, let my opinion be known. All right, man. All right. So I think that, you know,

756
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:06,400
it's kind of dawn to me. Here's where we unite. Okay? Forget about whether it's true or not. Okay?

757
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:12,320
There's clearly that we all agree that the burning fossil fuel is not a good idea for a number of

758
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:20,640
reasons. And each person's reason may be different, but imagine a world where energy actually was

759
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,600
free, and anyone could have it for anything they want at any given moment. Imagine how the world

760
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:30,800
would change if we actually had that. If there was a windmill, you could erect in your backyard.

761
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:36,320
If there was a solar panel that could collect enough energy, if there were magnets that could be

762
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:43,200
strung together that creates a perpetual motion machine throwing off multiple times the energy

763
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:48,800
then goes into it. Imagine that world. That's the world I want to work towards. Not about

764
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:54,160
bickering about whether it's real or not real. I don't give a shit. I do care about the energy

765
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:00,640
elite who are controlling our lives because they control energy. That's what we need to move away from.

766
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:09,440
That's surely we can unite on. Hey, Adam. Hey, this is John. Well, this show, um, say, come,

767
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:16,320
free energy rocks. You know, um, it sounds like you are tuned into the economic mafia,

768
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:21,920
the strategy that's kept us from clean and cheap energy for decades and Tesla. And you know,

769
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:27,200
I see in some of those videos that explain in a recent fashion, how is stuff? Some of these

770
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:37,280
recently worked. So, why don't we just raise the ruckus by getting people to build this stuff? And

771
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:45,520
you know, I think if a bunch of electric meters were to turn backwards, that would speak a lot more loudly.

772
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:56,160
Yeah, yeah. Then, and speak a lot more, um, popularly than any of these jackals could counter.

773
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:03,120
So, think about it. Hey, love the show. We need to right here. All right. That's better. Bye.

774
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:07,440
All right, dude. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. So, this is really my point.

775
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:13,280
This is just part of, uh, becoming aware of what's going on around us. Again, just to summarize,

776
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,680
we're no longer on this program going to, going to bigger back and forth about whether

777
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:24,160
global warming, global cooling, climate change, et cetera, exists or not. Because first of all,

778
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:29,680
it, of course, changing climate exists. We're not going to argue about whether we're polluting

779
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:36,720
our Earth, killing our Earth because, well, obviously, we're doing unnatural things. We're creating

780
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:43,760
unnatural substances in more ways than one. Um, and um, because as my show, I'm just going to say

781
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:49,520
screw that, you know, we're arrogant and stupid if we think that we can blow up the world,

782
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:55,520
even with a nuclear holocaust, the world will survive it. Okay. We're not going to kill the world.

783
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:01,680
May it, it could be that it becomes uninhabitable for ourselves. Uh, but that's not the definition

784
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:08,800
of, of blowing up the world or killing the world. So, what we are going to work on is not accepting

785
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:14,400
punishment for being forced into using a certain type of energy because that's what's happening.

786
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:20,960
We're still being forced artificially and by evil means and for control and political issues,

787
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:27,520
we're being forced to use carbon-based energy and we should be rocking against that. All right.

788
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:34,240
We need to be looking for new forms of energy and not accepting being punished with, with, with

789
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:40,480
carbon taxes, which are already in place all over the place, allowing that to become a new monetary

790
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,720
system because once it's embedded, man, it's going to take another 70 years to get rid of it.

791
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:50,880
And I don't have that kind of time. So we got to be looking towards new energy. So I have a link

792
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:56,160
for you to study in the show notes, daily source code.com, crosspost at acurry.com, a company called

793
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:04,000
Black Light, Black Light Power. They have a new, uh, what is being touted as a physics-defying

794
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,160
fuel cell that, uh, you need to look into, uh, these guys are a serious business. They've, uh,

795
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:16,560
oh, I actually says here they found well healed backers to raise $60 million for their venture.

796
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:24,000
Let me see if it says who's invested in, uh, in the company. Here we go. The companies board

797
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,880
includes Michael Jordan, former CEO of electronic data systems and Westinghouse, Neil

798
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:39,360
Moskowitz, CFO of Credit Suisse First Boston, uh, Delaware Utility, Connective Mills. I don't know any

799
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:44,960
of these people. I don't know if I like them either. These are kind of people that kill stuff off.

800
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:50,160
Anyway, have a look at their technology. It's interesting. It's something new. And I'm going to be

801
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,960
trying to highlight as much new stuff as possible and let us just all agree that we won't

802
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:00,400
go on each other or call each other, not cases just because we believe that we can defy the current

803
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:08,400
rules of physics. Those are the rules. Anyway, let me see at a couple more things I want to

804
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:14,240
talk to you about, uh, uh, I actually mentioned this on no agenda briefly about the new, uh, CNN

805
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:20,880
holography, uh, the holograms they're using to beam, I love this, that to literally beam,

806
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:26,960
a television host into the studio, uh, linked to the YouTube clip in the show notes if you haven't

807
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:33,600
seen it yet. Uh, this is from the drop, which was also quite cool, uh, a perfect example of TV

808
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:43,200
trickery and action. Uh, and what was this? Um, let me see, let me take a look at it and see what

809
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:49,280
this article was. I had to save it for you for a reason. Oh, of course, I know what this is. This is

810
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:56,000
the, uh, this is that viral video from CNNBC video, which kind of has, you know, it's a, it's a

811
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,520
complete social cultural hack. So you receive this email that says, hey, wow, you know, it looks

812
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:05,600
like you were the guy you're in the news and then you fired up and someone has already pre-programmed

813
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:12,080
your name into it. Um, and if you look at it at first, you know, every single person who sees this

814
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:17,520
viral or this kind of started with snakes on a plane, I think, uh, where it's customized to your

815
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:23,040
name and it's video and it looks like it's baked right in. You know, you are actually believing that

816
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,840
for several seconds. Some even will finish the video and still say, wow, that's amazing. You know,

817
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:32,560
you're in that video. Your name is plastered all over. You were the guy that made the difference in the

818
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,960
vote. You got to take a look at the, at that link. And if you haven't seen it, but I'm sure

819
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:42,800
most of you have received this by now. Um, that's how well it works. And now we're even getting into

820
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:48,960
holography and and putting people in different spots. There's green screen technology. Please, please,

821
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,080
always keep your eyes and ears open and be very aware what's going on when things are shown to you

822
01:08:54,080 --> 01:09:01,280
on television because that clearly has become the main tool to get things done in our society. Just

823
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:07,120
make sure that the things that you want getting done. Adam, just a quick movie review. I saw

824
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:13,520
burn after reading last night. It was, it was good. It was funny. Brad Pitt actually is a really

825
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:21,680
good actor. He does a fantastic job as playing a brain dad, uh, fitness instructor. But the point

826
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:29,200
of my call is that, uh, the CIA director, the former CIA director, James Woolsey, plays the CIA

827
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:36,640
director in this movie. And if you go into the credits for the movie, if you go and you try to find

828
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:44,400
the image for this guy, he has been scrubbed clean on the internet. Very interesting. Our rulers,

829
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:51,360
do not want us to know. Yeah, if you really want to know about him and all about the CIA, get

830
01:09:51,440 --> 01:10:00,160
legacy of ashes via Tim Weiner, award-winning New York Times writer. My uncle, who was with the

831
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:07,760
CIA, CIA for many years, starting in the 60s, Uncle Don has told me privately, uh, but meant for

832
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,520
public consumption that everything in that book. He says it's pretty much the way he recalled it.

833
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:17,360
He says it's true. And you will find out more about James Woolsey if you read that book. I, uh,

834
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:24,320
I recommended highly. All right, just a couple of things before I go for today. Um, more about the,

835
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:33,760
HPV cervical cancer vaccine, uh, known as Gardasill. There's a lawsuit currently running in the

836
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,440
Netherlands. Let me bring up the webpage here. I'm putting that link in the show notes, although

837
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,200
be pretty useless if you don't speak Dutch, but just to give you an idea what's going on with this

838
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:46,640
on a worldwide basis. Uh, the Netherlands planning to put Gardasill into their health care package,

839
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:53,520
now this is the vaccine, which I do not believe has been tested sufficiently. I think it's a total

840
01:10:53,520 --> 01:11:00,640
scam by the pharmaceutical industry to take, uh, lots of money because they've got, they've got, um,

841
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:08,400
patents expiring. They need to have new lines of business and, uh, Glaxo Smith Klein is fighting.

842
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:18,240
You see, if I got it right here, uh, Sonofi Poster, uh, is actually fighting, uh, Glaxo Smith Klein,

843
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:27,200
because, um, Gardasill, uh, let's see if I'm saying it right now. Now I'm saying it the wrong. Uh,

844
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:36,560
yeah, exactly. So there's two types of this, uh, magical vaccine, which is actually killed children

845
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:44,000
as put them into all kinds of horrible states of pain and paralysis and there's just no

846
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:50,080
conclusive proof, not all the necessary studies have been done to know that this actually is 100%

847
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:54,800
full proof, which is not as far as I can deduce from the information and more about that in a second.

848
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:05,920
So, um, Sonofi Poster, uh, MSD produces Gardasill and then I'll pissed off because the Dutch

849
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,760
government has chosen, uh, server ricks, which is made by Glaxo Smith Klein. So they're

850
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,320
suing them saying, hey, you know, these guys are going to get billions of euros because you're putting

851
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,800
this into the healthcare package. You haven't, look, you haven't done an competitive study

852
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:26,800
and you should be at least taking our poison as well. So that, of course, will be hidden from

853
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,760
the international stage that lawsuit, but I'll keep my eye on it for you. And then there's a new link,

854
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:40,720
a new information that I'd like you to take a look at, from Dr. James Halenstein, um, and he has

855
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:48,320
some very interesting information about the vaccine for the human papilloma virus, HPV,

856
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:56,640
even about what that virus does itself. And if you have children and you're being confronted with the

857
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:04,880
issue of vaccination for this, whether it's mandatory or peer pressure or curiosity or belief

858
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:09,200
that it should be done, please have a read through and do your own research. It's incredibly

859
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:14,400
important. Um, and I can just tell you that on the horizon, I was someone was really nice to put a, uh,

860
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:22,720
put a link to the World Health Organization, EV in flu timeline, uh, which starts in, uh,

861
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:29,600
guess 1996 to see how many, because I, of course, we know that Barack Obama and Joe Biden and the

862
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:36,880
administration are, uh, making $4 billion available, uh, to combat this, uh, horrible, horrible, uh,

863
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:44,720
flu virus, which if you look at the timeline, has really not done that much. It has not killed a lot

864
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:49,680
of people. It's questionable whether, uh, those people were killed by that virus. And just look at

865
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:55,680
the data. It's tons and tons of data to roll through, uh, but a lot of it is, um, sketchy,

866
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:03,360
at best, um, and it's funny enough in Indonesia, where, uh, a lot of cases have, uh, have been found

867
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:11,120
of avian bird flu in humans, killing people, although, uh, relatively few compared to many other

868
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:17,920
diseases or traffic accidents or be bathroom accidents for that matter. Um, they actually did lots

869
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,640
of vaccinations in Indonesia and then all the subsequent years, you see, uh, it getting worse.

870
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,920
So I'm not going to show what they're vaccinating for, but keep your eye on that because they're

871
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,840
coming after you with a needle. I promise you they're coming after you with a needle.

872
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:38,400
Adam here at the program wanted to share with you a little poem I wrote today.

873
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:50,640
It's entitled, bring it back, bring it back. Here it goes. Old, to today's world, this new world order,

874
01:14:51,360 --> 01:15:00,080
straight from the pages of 1984, but far worse. Everyone is welcome across the U.S. border.

875
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:09,200
It's not the invading horde, but their master's curse. High, high, incredibly high.

876
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:14,800
Top of the pyramid, burst right provided them by factory and labor.

877
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:23,600
It put on the market hides the real bid, paid for governance, defines the real score.

878
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:33,440
Cheaply bought, but for years in the making, problem, reaction, solution, defined.

879
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:45,040
The populist not sleeping, but waking to the lies and truth, it's time to rewind, bring back

880
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:53,280
honor, purpose, and vitality. We, through action, bring back accountability.

881
01:15:54,400 --> 01:16:01,680
I hope you like this little song it and they will soon again work for us.

882
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:31,520
Connection at a feet close, but lose main. You can't always get what you want. You can't always get what you want.

883
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:49,520
You can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't imagine it.

884
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:31,520
You can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, the trials of those who you might know, the trials of those who you might know, the trials of those who you might know, the trials of those who you might know, the trials of those who

885
01:17:31,520 --> 01:18:01,520
you might know, where you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might know, you can't always get what you want, but in the trials of those who you might

886
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,520
Rescriptions feel

887
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,520
I was leaning in the eye

888
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,520
We're meant to jam it

889
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,520
A man didn't look to the ear

890
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,520
We could sign it

891
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,520
That he would have a small boy

892
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,520
My fever would play the tiramisu

893
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,520
I saw my song

894
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,520
To Mr. Jimmy

895
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,520
Yeah, and it's safe

896
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,520
To me, and I was there

897
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:38,520
You can't always get what you want

898
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,520
You can't always get what you want

899
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,520
You can't always get what you want

900
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,520
I know, but if you drive some

901
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,520
Just might find it

902
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,520
You can't always get what you want

903
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:28,520
I know, but if you drive some

904
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,520
Just might find it

905
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,520
Cheers

906
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,520
This song is a sweet

907
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,520
After that

908
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,800
I've got to do the extra

909
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,520
I've got to do this

910
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,520
My Jung Wann

911
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:56,520
You will practice at the end of the adventure

912
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:02,520
Well, not the tale, but the thing is

913
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:07,520
You can't always get rid of all

914
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:12,520
Yeah, you can't always get rid of all

915
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:17,520
You can't always get rid of all

916
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,520
Believe me, that's all I'm done

917
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,520
It's just my fault, it's my fault

918
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,520
You can't by chance

919
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:52,520
You can't always get rid of all

920
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:57,520
You can't always get rid of all

921
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:02,520
You can't always get rid of all

922
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:08,520
You can't always get rid of all

923
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:15,520
You can't always get rid of all

924
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:20,520
That's the soul wax 2008 edition of Stos

925
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,520
You can't always get what you want

926
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,520
Don't you know it?

927
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,520
Alright, that's it for this post-election

928
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,520

I'm sure I'll be here for the Fubar Friday

934
