1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You were listening to the last DSC, you heard Adam talk about the iPhone SDK.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And I got to tell you, it almost makes you want to quit your job and just develop apps for the iPhone.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's like, I know I could do it.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I know I could be really good at programming this stuff.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I know all kinds of cool widgets I'd want to make.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It'll be interesting to see how that plays out.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We'll have no fear because if you're hearing this, then Adam is back.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
He's not abandon us and he's bringing us the DSC 733.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Perhaps one of his widget he builds will be making his iPhone a submarine when

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
he drops it in the floor.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The 60 million dollars worth of airplane straps by us.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
To the next generation radio content in my ears.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I like to think I'm flying into this journey.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The next generation radio content in my ears.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I like to think I'm flying into this journey.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I've guessed it, it's Adam Curry.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
God, I believe it's above and more dead.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I went out for a ride and I never went back.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Like a river that falls over its floor.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't know what to look at, but just keep going.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Everybody's got our own brief heart.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Everybody's got our own brief heart.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Everybody's got our own brief heart.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Everybody's got our own brief heart.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Everybody's got our own brief heart.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Everybody's got our own brief heart.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Everybody's got our own brief heart.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Everybody's got our own brief heart.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Everybody's got our own brief heart.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Everybody's got our own brief heart.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Everybody's got our own brief heart.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Everybody's got our own brief heart.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Everybody's got our own brief heart.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Everybody's got our own brief heart.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Everybody's got our own brief heart.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,400
I love everybody who needs more days to rest

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,400
I never know about all the hell

38
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,400
I've always loved you and I've always loved the one you said

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I've loved you and I've always loved the one you said

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Everybody's got a free time

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,800
Everybody's got a free time

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Everybody's got a free time

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Everybody's got a free time

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Everybody's got a free time

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Oh man, I got to tell you

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Nothing like a bit of the boss to kick off a footballer Friday

47
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
How you doing everybody?

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,800
It is episode number 733 of the Daily Stores Code

49
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Thank you to the organization, the preservation of the soundtrack of our lives

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,800
We're a bit of a spring-steen there under educational auspices of course

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Hey, I'm back

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
You know what?

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,800
One episode this week, it might as well be the football Friday episode

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Correct man

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,800
I got so much to tell you guys, a lot has happened

56
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
And why don't we do it while chillin' out together

57
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,800
I'm here, I've got the Al Jazeera Bathrobe on

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,800
It's Friday, just a bit past 12 in the afternoon

59
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
I needed a bit of sleep, so I'm rested

60
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,800
I'm really bringing you your football Friday

61
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Only two big topics today, so make sure you stay tuned to it

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Without the entire episode

63
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
And of course, kick ass tunes

64
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
To wrap up your week and get you ready for the weekend

65
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
From the affluent suburb of Surrey

66
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,800
It's the west side of Gitan and Gild for upstairs in the attic

67
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,800
It is the Daily Source Code, the football Friday edition of 733

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Let's bring it on y'all

69
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,800

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,800
We'll start with going to us

72
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Crossing your pruning

73
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,800
From the head and the distance

74
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,800
So wish you moving

75
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,800
I'm really on my side of the town

76
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,800
And just a bit of night

77
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
And this is gonna go

78
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
From the mission room

79
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I was talking too much

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,800
I was just gonna be having all this good evening

81
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,800
And chillin' out together

82
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,800

126
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:26,000
It's a bit intense, kind of takes away the original vibe of the song, and grow one, the Eagles

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,120
Hotel California versus Hustle Athletics San Francisco. Just to keep the football

128
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,680
train running, you can't check in any time you want. You can never leave.

129
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:50,640
Holy moly. All right, everybody. How you doing? Oh, man. It's good to be back home,

130
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,520
been on the road for, for most of the week was home yesterday, but, um, oh, man, it's been so

131
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,600
incredibly busy. Yeah, I got another high frequency pitch tone coming from somewhere. We'll

132
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,880
just leave that for what it is for today. All right, everybody. Well, um, gee, I almost don't know where to

133
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,400
start. Um, I was on the road part of it in support of my, uh, my lovely wife, the lady Patricia,

134
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,640
who, um, has been selected. Actually she's been asked to make selections. Uh, I don't know. I'm sure

135
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,880
if you live, well, probably it's probably in about 60 countries now. So if you live, um, almost any

136
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,640
way you've probably seen a version of America's Got Talent, or perhaps Britain's Got Talent,

137
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,680
which actually, um, produced an amazing opera singer in the UK. So now there's the Holland's Got Talent

138
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,240
version of the show. And now you know, the, of course, the lady Patricia after, uh, walking around

139
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,440
with, uh, an effective effect that appendix for over a year. She's back. She's back on the sheen,

140
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,680
she's ready to rock and roll. And, uh, this offer came along. She's like, oh, wow, I can be a judge on

141
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,520
Holland's Got Talent. She said, I don't think they got any talents. So that, that should be a pretty

142
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,760
fun show. And of course it turns out that, uh, there is some talent hidden in those lowlands.

143
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,880
So anyway, um, that was a, I think a three day, uh, three day project for her and she's going back

144
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,240
at the end of the month. I won't be able to join her for that. I was able to take care of a couple

145
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,080
other things that I want to talk about. And of course, while on the road, a lot of things were

146
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:22,080
happening, uh, uh, back at HQ and San Francisco as well as in London, uh, you probably noticed podshow.com

147
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,400
and BT podshow. Our com have changed brand new, uh, looking field. This is not the coveted version

148
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:35,440
three V3s we call it. This is more like, uh, V2.5. And, uh, the reasons behind it, I will talk

149
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,240
about later on today because I think it's pretty exciting what's going on. Uh, yes, they, uh, spent a

150
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,240
lot of time on the phone, talking to a lot of people who work with us, um, talking about the transition

151
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,520
that we're making, uh, some of the changes, uh, it affects everybody across the board. But we're really

152
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,800
focused and I'm, I'm extremely happy, uh, at the place that we're in right now because, uh,

153
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,240
man, I think we're, uh, I think the rocket ship is, uh, is lit and we have some lift off.

154
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,040
But boy, interesting working out the payload. Okay, let's see. I got some songs lined up. I

155
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,960
do want to talk about, uh, that ends, and in something else, I've been getting some amazing offers

156
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,120
myself that I just want to share with you because they're so funny. And, uh, one or two, I might

157
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,960
actually, uh, I might actually consider. So I'd love to hear some feedback from you guys.

158
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,880
One of the thing before I forget, of course, that was an agro one mashup that I played for you.

159
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,320
Uh, you know, I spent some time yesterday, Patricia's working on another project.

160
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,360
And, um, she wants to do a version of Martha Reeves and the Van Delas doing heat wave.

161
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,160
And she was playing this, um, you know, the original track for me and she was, uh, saying, okay,

162
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,120
no, I want to do it differently. I want to, uh, I want to, uh, I want to basically shorten this

163
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,560
bit here, uh, move this right after the, uh, to right after the intro. And as she's playing it,

164
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:53,360
I'm listening to the song and I'm going to jade a bug, uh, jade a bug. And she's like,

165
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,400
wow, you're right. You could do a perfect mashup of Martha Reeves and the Van Delas,

166
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,760
and uh, wham's waking me up before you go go. And like, you know, I'm sure someone has done

167
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,000
that one already. It makes so much sense. I mean, everything about that song is just like

168
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,440
wake me up before you go go. And I did some Google searches. I went to mashuptown.com,

169
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,040
which, of course, is the official supplier of mashups. Um, I did some searches on SeekPod,

170
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,600
absolutely no luck, no joy whatsoever. And I'm amazed. So this weekend, actually, um, my plan is

171
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,400
on Sunday. I'm going to see if I can do my own mashup because I think it'll be a perfect combination.

172
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,800
Of course, if anyone has a mashup, please let me know before Sunday, fire me off an email or

173
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,360
something like that. Let me know because, uh, I'm sure that whoever has done something,

174
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,200
it's going to be better than what I come up with on one of my first mashup tries. So please

175
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,480
do let me know if you have something out there. Or if you think you can do it because I'd love

176
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:56,480
to have a version. I'm Sean. I'm Joseph. And we're the ad bastards. The movies convince you

177
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,760
that advertising was the greatest job owner. Well, welcome to your wakeup call podcasting for

178
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,600
the studio and DFW. We've got insights into what's really going on in advertising. So check us out

179
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,080
on iTunes or adbusters.com because, you know, the movies were just a lie.

180
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:23,120
All right. Yes, I'm sure they are. Adbusters. Uh, ad bastards. You got to listen to that show.

181
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,520
Yeah, I'm a big fan of marketing shows. CC Chapman does one. Uh, Joseph Jaffee, of course,

182
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,440
has across the sound. He celebrated over 100 episodes recently. I believe in these guys

183
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,160
when I want this scene. That's good stuff, man. If you really want to know what's going on with

184
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,120
mainstream and what's happening with advertising, that's the place to listen to them. Okay. So

185
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,640
I'll be talking about some of that myself later on, at least the mainstream portion of it, uh, and

186
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,200
how it's, uh, how it's been, uh, touching my life. So we'll get into that a bit of, of course, it's a

187
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,760
food bar Friday. That means we have to have some surges. He thought he'll be coming up just a little bit.

188
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,160
And we're already up to episode number 113 of Yon Paul. Let's hit test. Yon, bring it in.

189
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,160
Good to use the test with Yon Paul.

Hi, Yon. Hey, Adam. Hi, doing. Um, I'm doing is hit this number 113. And we're going to start

191
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:23,440

192
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,640
I would recognize Angel of Harlem by you two in the middle of the night. Number two.

193
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
Whoa.

194
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,400
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Okay, that I would not recognize the middle of the night.

195
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:51,600
And this is intro number three. Oh, Joseph is on a vacation for, um, um, um, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

Thank you, YouTube.

Excellent day.

200
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,480
YouTube Angel of Harlem is answer number one.

201
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
What was that?

202
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,480
This is answer number two.

203
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,480
From 87 to Gino Vanelli.

204
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
Oh man.

205
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,480
What a choice young wildborses man.

206
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
I would never have gotten out.

207
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,480

208
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
And this is answer number three.

Congratulations.

211
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Congratulations.

212
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,480
Congratulations.

213
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Congratulations.

214
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
Congratulations.

215
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,480
I don't want to lose your love tonight.

216
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
It's the outfield for sure.

217
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,480
From 1986 outfield for your love.

218
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
All right.

219
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Again give me that.

220
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
It's number 113.

221
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Yeah.

222
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
So Adam, how did you do?

223
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,480
I think I got like one and a half or close to two right.

224
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,480
And not bad.

225
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
You're not bad.

226
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
All right.

Bye bye.

237
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,480
Be back to test at gmail.com.

238
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
info.

239
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
Young bullet.com.

240
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,480
JNPOLVT.com.

241
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Oh man.

242
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
If you thought my singing on the hit test was bad.

243
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Please look at the American out.

244
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Can I say the obvious before we start,

245
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,480
which is I think you're over 20 years.

246
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
All right.

247
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
Tell me why you hit that.

248
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,480
If you've ever seen a film for the Wedding singer,

249
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,480
it was a guy who performs a wedding.

250
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
That's what he looked like.

251
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,480
What are you going to sing today to prove that you are the next American artist?

252
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Snatch from pushing the musical.

253
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,480
There's a part of me that's been killed.

254
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,480
When I'm weird, I'm always out drinking.

255
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,480
There's something special about you, girl.

256
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,480
If I'm not thinking, I'm all out.

257
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
I'm sure you think of it.

258
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,480
I've heard some weird auditions in my life,

259
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,480
but I've got to tell you that it's possibly the weirdest I've ever heard in my life.

260
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,480
I mean, it was like a one year old singing song.

261
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
You don't really cut out to be a singer.

262
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
I don't think.

263
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
I'm a singer of K.

264
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
I'm a singer.

265
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,480
You don't.

266
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
You don't.

267
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
You don't.

268
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
Okay.

269
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,480
Zero for effort.

270
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,480
Zero for style.

271
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,480
Zero for stock quality.

272
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,480
And you know what?

273
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,480
I think you just killed my favorite song a little time.

274
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,480
So you think you can sing any better?

275
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
Prove it.

276
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
Head over the music.potsho.com

277
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
and pick out your favorite pot-sake track.

278
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,480
Then go over to thepot5.com for all the details.

279
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
We'll be competing against some of the best

280
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,480
and some of the worst singers on the internet.

281
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
And who knows?

282
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,480
You may become the next pot-five aisle.

283
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,480
Okay.

284
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
There you go.

285
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
It could happen.

286
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
All right.

287
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,480
The first stop on the football trains coming up after a song

288
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,480
from the pot-sake music network.

289
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
Got a couple of those lined up for it.

290
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,480
Because, man, there's some good stuff coming up.

291
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,480
I'll talk to you on the side of a Sarah Vaughan

292
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
to hard as I got sunshine.

293
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
Living in a dangerous court.

294
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
And it's so hard to find a time

295
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,480
to really open and need my plea.

296
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Keep my soul in drink the wine.

297
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,480
So much more for me to be.

298
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,480
I'll be on what I can see.

299
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
I choose to let the sunshine make what.

300
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,480

646
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,680
He said, I mean, email a while ago, he says, you know, we've got this show and I think

647
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
it's perfect for you.

648
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,840
I'd really like you to take a look at the treatment and see if you're interested in doing

649
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
the pilot for us.

650
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,240
The first thing I said, of course, is dude, I'm not interested in a mainstream television

651
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,240
career.

652
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:59,600
I'm not interested in, you know, I don't have no intention of a career in making television

653
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,440
pilots unless they're for pod show and we're making them for online.

654
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,000
That I'm interested in what kind of show is it?

655
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's a game show.

656
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm like, wow, I've always wondered what it would be like to do a game show.

657
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,600
And they've come up with a very interesting, very simple program.

658
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,520
And so they sent me the treatment, read through it, and so I did hook up with them.

659
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,160
And we went through kind of like a version of the game and I got to tell you, I had a lot

660
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
of fun.

661
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:36,040
Really enjoyed, you know, basically being a game show host, it was great because it had

662
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:41,520
nothing to do with me, nothing to do with, well, actually, the way this thing is set

663
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,880
up, there's a lot of freedom for the host or the presenter to bring a lot of his own

664
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,920
personality and really a lot of freedom of movement, which to me is quite the opposite

665
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,160
of the restrictive environment of television.

666
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,480
You know, I'm a much more an audio guy or a radio guy because I basically control

667
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
everything from beginning to end.

668
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,120
And I don't know, you know, if we can strike the right deal, I said, look, I'm not interested

669
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
in making a pilot.

670
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,280
If you'll give me a piece of the action, well, yeah, then we can talk.

671
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,480
So I think, I think we got something, we're pulling something together there.

672
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,920
And of course, this is the perfect, you know, almost all game shows you can make derivatives

673
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,320
of the work perfectly online, you know, not a 22 minute or 30 minutes with commercial

674
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,400
version, but I'm pretty sure there's something we could do in a, you know, one to three

675
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
minute version.

676
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,880
So I'll keep you up to speed on that.

677
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,760
It was just really interesting to get in touch again with some mainstream media folks

678
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,400
and they're still to say nothing has changed.

679
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,320
And they're all in awe of what we're doing, I might add.

680
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,160
They're all extremely envious of how quickly we can, you know, we as independent producers

681
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,640
can crank out new ideas, test them out, you know, we don't have a pilot season.

682
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:58,360
We can, I look, as far as I'm considered, or as far as the show is considered, this

683
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,960
is still in pilot phase episode 733 of the pilot.

684
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,160
I am the pilot of the airwaves, 16 million dollars worth of airplane strap to my ass.

685
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,160
What can I say?

686
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,560
I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out.

687
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:23,560
Your honor, please don't think that, Gavl, you can try this cowbell out.

688
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Let's all give a nod.

689
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:37,560
To the hardest work in law here, it's Jersey time, yeah, yeah, it's Jersey time, oh yeah.

690
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,560
You're out there, what do you say?

691
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,560
You might even come to the end.

692
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Yo, yo, yo.

693
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:50,560
Yo, how's it going Adam, it's Jersey time, the official musicologist of the Cha Cha.

694
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Dude, I'm a little sad, don't know.

695
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,560
I've got to tell you it's been a rough week with no DSCs.

696
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,560
I don't know how people are getting through, I mean, the economy's going to shit.

697
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,560
The world's just changing.

698
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,560
It's just sad, man.

699
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
I need something to cheer me up.

700
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
I don't know what I need.

701
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
I need the temple of soul.

702
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,560
Check these guys out.

703
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,560
They're out of flooring and man.

704
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
If they don't make it happy, nothing will.

705
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Cause they got sunshine in your smile.

706
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
They're just...

707
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:23,560
You know, in this life, there are circumstances that happen beyond our control.

708
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,560
And you can say it.

709
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,560
But no, I love you.

710
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,560

From the pod say music now, work at music dot podshow dot com andウ, of course you can find

907
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,040
a player at Podshow dot com slash music.

908
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,280
Uh, look for crow.

909
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,020
Crazy and uh, I'll put a link in the show notes and you can find it easily.

910
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,860
alright, so uh, we released v2.5 yesterday.

911
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,640
Um, pretty big deal for us.

912
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,640
Um, kind of, yeah.

913
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,720
I mean, uh, we're still a relatively young company, even though man, we've been doing

914
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,860
this for three years now since 2005, we started the company,

915
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,060
the company.

916
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:20,340
But we're still agile enough to make some fast moves when we really need to make them.

917
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,940
And let me tell you a little bit about what's going on.

918
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,540
If you look at the new site, so this is really a, I even posted it on curry.com.

919
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,260
This is not a face lift, really.

920
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,620
It's more like a Botox injection, if you will.

921
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,900
As we continue our way towards V3, which you'll have more technological improvements.

922
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:42,700
This really changes the home pages for Potcha.com and VT Potcha.com shows a little bit of

923
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,340
a direction where we want to go with how we're displaying media.

924
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,940
Most of the underlying things are still the same, there's some design changes.

925
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,860
And of course, there's lots of bugs and it should be worked out as you can always expect.

926
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,980
But it has sparked a very good conversation because I believe that people are seeing

927
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:04,020
that we're now finalizing our strategy and I want to drill down on this today.

928
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,820
So you can think about it over the weekend.

929
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:11,180
Obviously, I didn't have, I really didn't have the energy, honestly, to go through

930
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,940
voicemail feedback for today's show.

931
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,940
So I'm sure we'll have plenty of it to talk about next week.

932
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,540
And darn, if I don't want to do a five show week next week, man, I really need it.

933
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,700
This was no good.

934
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,700
Again, apologies.

935
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,700
It's just the way it worked out.

936
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,700
Tough.

937
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,700
That's it.

938
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,700
What?

939
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,700
Who needs sleep?

940
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,700
Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you that I've also been asked to participate in a morning

941
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,500
radio program on a regular basis.

942
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,860
That's the thing I have to say that interests me the most because I've been experimenting

943
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,860
a bit with live shows.

944
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,940
Haven't done one on the Charlie in a while.

945
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,540
But I think I have an idea of how we're going to do it next week.

946
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,060
Because that is another part of what I love doing, man.

947
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:57,260
I love talking to people live and chatting around.

948
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:01,660
Anyway, if you look at Pachot.com, if you haven't, maybe if you're not in the car or

949
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,180
if you're not on the road, you could take a look at it now if you haven't seen it.

950
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,380
You'll see here that we're really playing into our strategy.

951
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,780
Let me tell you what that is.

952
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,940
So first of all, about two months ago, maybe three months ago, we really discovered

953
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:21,900
that we have two lines of business that are absolutely kicking ass and really, really working.

954
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,380
One of them is already making really decent money.

955
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,780
The other one is just about to hit.

956
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,860
So I'll start with that one.

957
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,980
That is online video.

958
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:37,380
When I say online video, I'm not talking about necessarily YouTube, like user-generated

959
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:45,060
clips because the real business turns out is independently produced, semi-professionally

960
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:51,820
produced or even professionally produced because it does work for sites like Hulu.

961
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,660
Short form, I must say, episodic content.

962
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,940
So of course, we have several hundred video programs now on our network that are short

963
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:06,820
form, that are very targeted and that are formats that are absolutely created for the

964
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,820
online audience and they're working.

965
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:15,060
What we figured out is how to market those programs and I know I've talked about this

966
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,060
a lot.

967
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:20,980
You know, it's, yes, there are some advantages that mainstream has because they have

968
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,980
a channel.

969
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,900
There's only so many channels on your television.

970
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,740
It is an ever-expanding universe, I might point out.

971
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:31,620
So that advantage is slipping away quite rapidly.

972
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:36,460
But essentially, in the mainstream entertainment business, whether it's music, whether it's

973
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:41,140
television, whether it's film, it's all about marketing.

974
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:47,060
If you make a $100 million film and you have a $20 million star in that, the first thing

975
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,780
that's done is that $20 million is considered a marketing cost.

976
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,660
Tom Cruise is an OK actor, but he's not all that great.

977
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,980
Is he really worth $20 million?

978
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,620
Yeah, well, at one point he was because he was a big name draw.

979
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,340
His name will put butts and seats and theaters.

980
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,900
We'll get people buying DVDs.

981
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,140
So that's basically part of marketing.

982
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,980
You make a $100 million movie.

983
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:15,180
You could easily spend $125 million on marketing the movie all the way throughout its lifespan

984
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,740
from film onto DVD.

985
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,740
Same goes for television.

986
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:24,140
In fact, when you have a number one hit show, dancing with the stars, it's not like,

987
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,380
oh, we're number one and we just kick back and relax and the audience just keeps coming

988
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,380
back.

989
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,380
Exactly the opposite.

990
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,780
The marketing money is turned up even further because you're going to sell more advertising

991
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,780
at higher prices.

992
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,500
You need to keep those numbers there.

993
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:42,180
So you start marketing it and there's, oh, man, they spent so much money on it.

994
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,180
Let's just take that show as an example.

995
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:50,260
Outside of advertisements, promos, you run a promo in your own television network.

996
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,300
I think that's what is dancing with the stars, Fox.

997
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,300
That's not free.

998
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,180
That's, you're using up that airtime instead of a commercial.

999
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,580
So that's a cost.

1000
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,580
There's billboards.

1001
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,500
There's advertisements and magazines.

1002
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:08,300
There's PR firms that are taking the stars all around to all the different shows, talk

1003
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,620
shows, to be talking about their experience.

1004
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:17,020
There's a huge PR machine that's working for the program and it costs a lot of money.

1005
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,660
The more successful it is, the more marketing that has to be done to maintain that.

1006
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:29,740
So what sites like YouTube and AOL and now there's really the user generated sites while

1007
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:35,060
extremely entertaining and while there's tons of good stuff and of course a lot of that

1008
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,900
good stuff is stolen content.

1009
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,300
That's not like you still can't find the daily show on YouTube or the documentary that

1010
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,460
aired yesterday that you missed on television.

1011
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,500
You can still find that all over YouTube.

1012
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,500
In general, brand advertisers, the big boys, the Coca-Cola, the Proctor and Gamble, the

1013
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:58,980
next 10 billion dollars of advertising that's going to come online, has not really come

1014
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:05,140
online yet because they are afraid to advertise in a non-brand safe environment.

1015
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,140
What do I mean?

1016
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,140
My non-brand safe?

1017
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:14,220
Well, to look at YouTube, they don't want the risk of all of a sudden having their advertising

1018
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:18,300
sitting next to on top of or being pre-rolled in front of someone shooting a firecracker

1019
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,300
out of his ass.

1020
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,900
It's just not what brands are into.

1021
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:30,020
So of course YouTube did build up a huge audience of eyeballs, but it's unmonitizable.

1022
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:35,300
In fact, I know for a fact that last year, Pod Show made more money on advertising sales

1023
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,300
than YouTube.

1024
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:42,500
I think they just got it like an $8 million Microsoft Xbox 360 campaign.

1025
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,900
That's obviously a really good deal.

1026
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:49,260
Clearly, that's a brand advertiser who does take the risk and they'll live with it because

1027
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,260
it's a gaming industry.

1028
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:56,460
There's a lot of risk already involved in the content that are contained in the games.

1029
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,460
And I think they're right.

1030
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,700
I think that is appropriate for that type of advertiser.

1031
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,100
You're not going to see cover girl.

1032
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:09,620
You're not going to see Coca-Cola necessarily rolling out brand advertising in a broad way

1033
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:13,020
on user-generated video or on social media sites.

1034
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:19,660
In fact, Google guaranteed a rather large amount of advertising for my space, they can't

1035
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,660
fulfill the order.

1036
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:26,420
You know, the traffic is just not valuable enough and it turns out that on these social

1037
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:32,020
media, social sites, social networking sites.

1038
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,660
People are getting pretty good at avoiding the ads.

1039
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,660
Go figure.

1040
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,660
That's because they're ads.

1041
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:41,020
They're not integrated within the content and they're just, they'll still not relevant.

1042
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,020
Okay.

1043
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:46,580
So meanwhile, you've got brand advertisers desperate to advertise on video online.

1044
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:50,340
So they wind up eventually going to people who have brand-save video.

1045
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,540
So an example is Hulu.

1046
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:56,380
An example, I think juice dual put them in that category even though they don't see

1047
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:01,540
anything to be, you know, quite as on fire as they were and I believe that's because you

1048
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,980
have to download a separate application, but that's just me.

1049
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:11,060
But also, I haven't really seen great content from them yet, but you know, they're definitely

1050
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,060
in the game.

1051
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:18,740
AOL Yahoo, you know, they do have some independently produced, semi-professionally produced,

1052
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,340
or even professionally produced content.

1053
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:25,260
Of course, the independently produced stuff is what interests me the most personally,

1054
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:30,860
because I think it's the most creative and hits the audience right between the eyes.

1055
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:35,580
So with the amount of content we have, with a number of episodic shows and our knowledge

1056
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,180
of how to market those shows online, which we've gotten really good at.

1057
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,380
Make no mistake and mistake.

1058
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,540
We spend real money using other types of networks.

1059
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,860
We use Google AdWords.

1060
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:50,700
We use all kinds of different ways to introduce relevant audience to the programming we have.

1061
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,500
And if you don't market, yeah, you have organic growth of every single show.

1062
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,740
You know, the numbers drop down.

1063
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,820
You turn the marketing up, the numbers go up again.

1064
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,380
This is just the way media works.

1065
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,020
We, you know, people kind of forgot that with these viral videos.

1066
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,620
You know, there's no way to advertise on a viral video.

1067
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:11,780
You know, if something all of a sudden goes viral, and let's say it is even brand, brand

1068
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:15,460
safe, you still have to get the rights to sell advertising on it.

1069
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:20,220
And by that time, you know, millions of people have seen it, you know, how can I go to an advertiser

1070
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,820
who's trying to plan their advertising campaign and get them to advertise on it?

1071
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,020
It's too late, the moment's over.

1072
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:33,740
So it's not a stable, sustainable, or predictable business model with any type of visibility.

1073
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,500
So we have one.

1074
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,420
And it's gotten so interesting now that there's hundreds of millions of dollars out there

1075
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:45,340
for online video, episodic, brand safe, independently produced.

1076
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,340
And these big guys can't fulfill the order.

1077
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,460
They just, they just don't have the inventory or they don't have the rights or they

1078
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,220
can't promise brand safeness.

1079
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,700
Okay, that's what we're coming in.

1080
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,700
Come in.

1081
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:03,100
Some of this opportunity is now starting to spill over and start to start to drip into

1082
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,100
our lap.

1083
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,820
And, you know, it may not take much.

1084
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:10,860
We could be close to a tipping point where a lot could just come streaming in.

1085
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,900
Again, we have the ability to fulfill these orders because we know how to market to our

1086
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,900
audiences.

1087
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,140
We know how to get, you know, a hundred or a hundred and fifty million views in a month.

1088
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:25,100
And we have the knowledge of how to do it and it's working and it's paying off.

1089
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:30,460
And people like the content, co-figure advertisers love the fact that their messages

1090
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:34,260
are relevant, that the audience that we're bringing in to these programs are relevant

1091
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,260
and the paying for it.

1092
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,940
So that's obviously awesome.

1093
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,980
And that's something that we've been focused on for a while and it's a real line of

1094
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:47,580
business for us and we're concentrating a majority of our efforts on that.

1095
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:52,740
Now we have the other side and on the other side would be this side of the house.

1096
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:59,540
Let's just call it podcasts, but it's really mainly audio long-form programming that

1097
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,420
is not necessarily brand safe.

1098
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,780
I would not call this show brand safe at all.

1099
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,180
In fact, you don't hear many advertisers on this program do you?

1100
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:13,660
You've got some bold ones like Nokia who of course allow me to sell the Nokia N810 at

1101
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,660
a 15% discount.

1102
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,140
We've got a new price by the way, go to podshowoffers.com.

1103
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,900
The price has been reduced.

1104
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,540
Use my checkout code daily source code to get your 15%.

1105
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:26,580
You can't get this thing cheaper anywhere and there's been quite a price war and all kinds

1106
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,980
of confusion going on, but podshowoffers.com still has the cheapest price.

1107
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:36,180
If you use my code daily source code, then of course there's also go daddy where you can

1108
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:39,380
use my checkout code DSC3.

1109
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,100
Now on all of these and you've heard me do these before, these are, we just call these

1110
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:52,460
our campaigns and we have a large group of producer, producers who make, well, I've got

1111
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,820
to call them, you just differentiate their podcasts, you know, I really think the audio

1112
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:01,380
part is, even though there's all kinds of confusion in the marketplace about what

1113
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:07,500
a podcast is, let's just say this is audio only just for the purposes of this discussion.

1114
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:13,700
Now in audio shows and you know, that's, that is the genesis of our company.

1115
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:18,340
A lot of the shows don't have huge audiences, there's not many, in fact, there's only

1116
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:24,620
probably two handfuls of shows that can do over a million listens a month.

1117
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:27,420
And some of the, you know, of course there's always some stuff that there's always some

1118
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:33,100
exception to the rule, but in general, most of the shows, if you were to look at an advertising

1119
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:39,020
ratio where ads are spots are sold at a cost per thousand.

1120
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:43,740
So for video, I think it's between $25 and $35 per thousand.

1121
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:48,860
So if you have 1,000 people listening to the show, we could essentially sell one commercial

1122
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,340
and that would get you 25 to 35 bucks.

1123
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,340
Okay.

1124
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:56,780
So you can see where that's not going to be a lot of money for most of these producers, however,

1125
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:03,020
the audiences that these shows have, including you chuckle heads out there, are an extremely

1126
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,020
loyal.

1127
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:09,540
They listen to the entire program, they catch up, they're involved or as the advertising

1128
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:13,540
business likes to say, they're extremely engaged.

1129
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:20,620
And they're convertible into customers, purchasers of product, either endorsed by the host,

1130
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,020
or discussed in the program.

1131
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:29,180
Sometimes even, only Ancillary mentioned the program, but further promoted on the show

1132
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,100
side or on a weblogg.

1133
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:35,820
So, and this is what we discovered with music, of course, you know, the Potsay music network

1134
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:40,220
is built on this principle of loyal audiences who will listen to what, you know, their

1135
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,620
buddies saying on the show will give something to try, they're willing to try it out,

1136
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:46,820
and they'll provide feedback if they think it sucks.

1137
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:53,580
So I believe in the past trailing 12 months, we sent out over $1.4 million in checks

1138
00:51:53,580 --> 00:52:00,500
to this pool of producers who are on these campaigns like GoDaddy, like Nokia, because

1139
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:06,300
over every GoDaddy account they sell, every listener they bring in and convert to becoming

1140
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,300
a customer.

1141
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:11,660
Obviously, the host gets a piece of that, gets a piece of the action, and this is really

1142
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,660
working.

1143
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:18,780
We've got people with only a couple CPMs, if you will, who are making over $100,000

1144
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:19,780
here.

1145
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:25,700
So, if they're making money, we're making money and I'm extremely excited about how successful

1146
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,700
this has become.

1147
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,980
Almost, I have to say it's kind of exclusive to what Potsho is doing because it is a lot

1148
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:38,780
like an affiliate sales network, only it includes a programming, which makes so much sense.

1149
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:44,780
It's almost like podcast advertising, you know, it was meant to be this form of hybrid,

1150
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:49,460
and it's really working because you don't have to worry about really what you're doing

1151
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:56,660
on your show or the content of your show and the companies that are driving these campaigns

1152
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,700
they're only interested in sales.

1153
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,700
They just want to make money.

1154
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:03,460
They really don't care that much how you do it as long as the money keeps rolling in.

1155
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:06,500
And isn't that kind of a beautiful situation?

1156
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:11,540
So, we've got those two lines of business, and they're making money for us and the things

1157
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,340
we do with them are profitable.

1158
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:18,940
So, you're going to see Potsho.com focus on those two main features.

1159
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:22,140
And we're making those into many networks.

1160
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:26,700
We're making them into channels where we're going to open up our producer pool.

1161
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,740
Much, we're going to open up much wider.

1162
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:32,260
We're going to come up with a whole new set of contracts that makes it much easier for

1163
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:38,340
people to come in, you know, get on our programs, see if they like what we're doing.

1164
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,380
Check out some of the deals that they can participate in and make money with.

1165
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:47,660
We provide you with training, with tools, with all kinds of support outside of the architecture

1166
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:53,380
of course that you just need to get your show up and running and statistics, et cetera.

1167
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:57,100
And of course, there's the business back and the real infrastructure that was necessary

1168
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,100
to do this.

1169
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:04,940
And I'm, although I love doing video, I got to tell you, I'm extremely excited about

1170
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:05,940
this.

1171
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,820
And so, you can look forward to a number of campaigns.

1172
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:13,500
Those of you who are already already in the Potsho producer group, we've got a couple

1173
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,660
of new campaigns on the way, which are going to blow your socks off directly related

1174
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:23,220
to your audiences, where you're actually in a way, we'll be selling yourself.

1175
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:27,820
Not in the horrors kind of way, but you'll find out that's coming soon.

1176
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:31,780
As I said, we're going to open it up much wider so that, you know, with less restrictions

1177
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:38,180
and I think we'll probably be able to convert most of our existing producers into this

1178
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:44,540
new contract, new agreement, which contains most of what people have been asking for.

1179
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,900
You know, easy way in, easy way out.

1180
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:51,260
We've already been really cool about, you know, we don't want to own your shit.

1181
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,420
It's your shit to do with what you want.

1182
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:58,700
Here's how you can work with us, here's how you can make money and hear the, and here

1183
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:06,140
are the examples of the quite a large group of people who are actually doing it.

1184
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:10,540
So that affects us in a big way.

1185
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:17,300
So this past week, we've been, yeah, we've really been restructuring, reorganizing, re-shuffling.

1186
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:24,940
We continue to, excuse me, blow full steam ahead to get the, to get V3 out.

1187
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:31,500
I think probably around the 21st, yes, that should be another week or so.

1188
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,180
You're going to see stuff coming online continuously.

1189
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:37,380
And of course, stuff will break and there'll be some good stuff and some bad stuff.

1190
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,100
And we'll just do what we can, right?

1191
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:45,460
And I look, oh, listen those birds outside.

1192
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:51,100
Oh, man, spring is almost here, except it's really wet, really cold.

1193
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,700
It's a UK spring.

1194
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,620
What happened to global warming, man?

1195
00:55:55,620 --> 00:56:00,060
I thought I was going to have exclusive beachfront access here in the UK.

1196
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:04,260
I, I, I, all right, I want you to think about that over the weekend that if you have any

1197
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:09,180
ideas, or thoughts or feedback, just call it into the voicemail lines, I'm still looking

1198
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,980
for a new voicemail jingle, by the way.

1199
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:15,060
The numbers are listed in the show, no, it's a daily source code.com.

1200
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,860
Hello, Adam, let's listen to the chart chart.

1201
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:22,100
This is Robert Gold and Toronto, host of the business cast at businesscast on podshow.com.

1202
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,860
We just got the anti unjust Smith jingles.

1203
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:28,180
Wait a year, here is latest for the business cast that's business cast by podshow.com, swing

1204
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:35,180
Jeff Swing from a local bagel shop somewhere, it's the business cast.

1205
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:41,620
Grab a hot press, bagel and a cup of Joe, a set you step down, and here we go.

1206
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:46,620
It's on top of the trend, and gets them advice with new perspective.

1207
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,620
Yeah, that's nice.

1208
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:54,860
Buildness, business, digital entrepreneur, for those to make the best of their business.

1209
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:00,460
It's your business, take it to the next level, make it that out of the mess, make it

1210
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:04,420
the next level, make it that out of the list.

1211
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,420
Nice.

1212
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:09,940
All right, to wrap up today's Charlie, and then the footballer Friday, this is a track that

1213
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:14,180
was sent to me, or actually brought to my attention by Matthew Eble, of course, good friend

1214
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,180
of the Charlie.

1215
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:20,260
This is a couple of his buddies from Nashville that just joined the pod, safe music revolution,

1216
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:27,260
he wants me to share him with you, and I, hey, kick this, fans called the Lila

1217
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:35,540
Y, got a front man with a ten-toned voice, no fool on baby.

1218
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:38,540
Here's walk on by on the footballer Friday.

1219
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:56,860
I remember only breathing alone, when I bet that I'm side of pride, I know my will

1220
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:05,860
is by the sea, I wonder how it cuts over here's the lead, only watching life bring a

1221
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:26,860
change in time, oh, what these lives have got to be, so the keys that I've ever made,

1222
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,860
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1223
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:10,860
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no or just an access, excuse, I'll make a sign.

1224
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:36,860
But with her eyes on her past,

1225
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:41,860
Yes, and this body,

1226
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,860
I can't believe there's something so beautiful,

1227
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:48,860
Believe I feel it's so handy,

1228
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:52,860
And these lines on a face,

1229
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:59,860
And the way when I'm a lighter,

1230
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:03,860
This one gives in heels and heels,

1231
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:12,860
Oh, she said no, don't you wake up in your head.

1232
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:17,920
Nope, no, no, that doesn't matter

1233
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:24,640
Oh no, don't betray me

1234
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,220
Oh, no, don't betray me

1235
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,960
This is a moment, I just wanted

1236
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:39,380
Where Lord, walk online

1237
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:33,380
