Tell me more music, show me more music, show me more music

10
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:55,720
DJ La Clown is back with Evangents.

11
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:04,060
You're in the Sweet Dreams, rocked up, and messed up with the Rock Lobster from the V-52s

12
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,300
as called Sweet Lobster, mashed up, but of course, source for mashuptown.com, the official

13
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,600
supplier of mashups of the Daily Source code, and that is the program you're listening

14
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
to.

15
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,200
Right now, episode number 757 coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey, known as Gilford,

16
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,000
we're in the Curry Manor, where it's just a little past one, a clock, another beautiful

17
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
day.

18
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,160
There are clouds in the sky today, and I'm expecting a thunderstorm here or there.

19
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,040
But otherwise, ceiling and visibility, okay, we're cavo-k, my friends.

20
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,880
Hey, I did the, I did that Dutch thing this morning.

21
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,040
I've been talking about first time.

22
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,920
It's actually a holiday today in the Netherlands, which was kind of chosen on purpose.

23
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,960
If anything messed up with the communication lines, no one would hear it.

24
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,520
And it's almost like, you know, it's, it's, those guys over there, they're equivalent

25
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,880
of almost like a pirate radio station, although they have an incredible coverage.

26
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,160
And the music they're playing, they call it classic rock.

27
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,080
I don't know if this format exists in the States, but it's basically it's rock, but

28
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:10,360
it's not just classic from, you know, like 70s or even 60s, it goes all the way up to

29
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,680
today, as long as it's rock.

30
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,720
And that's, it's almost like sitting in the soundtrack to my life, and then being permitted

31
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
to talk.

32
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:28,000
I got a way to go with the audience, you know, I'm trying to migrate some of the, somewhat

33
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,080
I've learned here on the daily source code, see if that works in a live format, stuff

34
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,480
like the phone calls, et cetera.

35
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,880
I have a little bit of work to do, but it was fun.

36
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,880
And man, that technology that ISDN point to point, why can't we get these codecs on like

37
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:50,000
a Skype or whatever, it's like I'm using 64 kilobits going one way.

38
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,800
Now my upload speed on my DSL is 300 kilobits, so there's certainly enough to do that.

39
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:05,560
And why do people always call me silence when I'm really busy?

40
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,880
But the delay is like there's like 60 millisecond delay between both ends.

41
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,280
And, you know, it's just the codec, you know, I don't understand why we can't do that

42
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
over the internet.

43
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,680
You should be able to actually, I AB compared it against Skype.

44
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,840
Skype is about, I'd say the delay is probably 600 to 700 milliseconds, you know, between

45
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,160
the time that I speak and it reaches the other end of vice versa.

46
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,680
And so this is a tenth of that.

47
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,520
Oh man, would I enjoy no agenda that much more if we had no delay?

48
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,960
It's always funny, whenever something funny is said on a no agenda or almost any show

49
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:49,960
that does Skype between multiple parties, the laughter always comes a little, just that,

50
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,640
just that couple of milliseconds, too late after the punch line, you know, that's kind

51
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
of a bummer.

52
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,240
And boy, the quality, I got a convinced of where I had to do that with me.

53
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,840
Hey, you guys have really filled up today's show.

54
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,520
Michael Heads, you've got a lot to talk about and let's kick it off.

55
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,960
Hello Adam, this is Mark Zinkle.

56
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,600
I just want to let you know, I don't think anyone has told you this, but at least with me,

57
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:23,720
I'm getting each episode for quite a while to vice in my iTunes seat.

58
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:31,820
And I'm scrolling down right now and the cheese, I am ever since ever since I've

59
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,180
just episode 223, it's been happening.

60
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:43,140
So, so I'll let you know, maybe it's a problem you're aware of otherwise I'll stick it.

61
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,140
All right.

62
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,140
All right.

63
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,140
I think you're out of love.

64
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,140
Yeah, I love you too.

65
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,140
I love you too.

66
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,140
I'm 16.

67
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,140
Six, 10.

68
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,140
Bye bye.

69
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,860
All right, 16 times is that your prostate cancer prevention quota for the week?

70
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,460
Yeah, no, I'm playing this specifically because a lot of people are having this problem.

71
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:08,420
And it's of course it's related to the the name chain from podshow.com to mevio.com.

72
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:14,300
I believe it's the way that iTunes handles the global unique identifier.

73
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,860
I think they do it in a funky way that basically this is the result.

74
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,260
And probably what's going to happen is it's going to try and read download every single

75
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,260
episode.

76
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,060
Believe me, no one is pleased with this.

77
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,460
You're not liking it because it's a slipper up your bandwidth.

78
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,020
We're not liking it because it's slipper up our bandwidth that we pay for it.

79
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,260
But Andrew Grumman is on the case.

80
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,620
He's he's back well rested and is all over this.

81
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,660
Of course, it doesn't help just as another data point that I released show 7.56 on Friday,

82
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:51,100
which was the Fubar Friday edition and aptly titled it 7.55, which was, of course, the

83
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
episode before that.

84
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
I'm sorry.

85
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,780
That didn't help at all.

86
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,220
But people did enjoy the Fubar Friday regardless.

87
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,220
Hi, Adam.

88
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,380
I'm Steve from Boston and I just got done listening to paranoid, mashed up when we

89
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,540
will rock you and then you straight into it, you read right into rainbow since you've

90
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,540
been gone.

91
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,780
And my friend, you have pushed all the right buttons today.

92
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,380
I am a chronic scroll wheel guy.

93
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,900
I scroll through everything that I even think I might not like.

94
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,500
And just this Friday, this Fubar you got me.

95
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,100
Go and you pushed them all my friend.

96
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
Way to go.

97
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
I am loving it.

98
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,380
You have a whole lot of it.

99
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,900
That's why I do this show.

100
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,300
That kind of response will get me up every single time.

101
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,460
It will get me out of bed.

102
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,780
I mean, you know, well, you know what I was, you know what I was, you know what I'm

103
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,780
going to say.

104
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,260
Adam, this is Ron from Philadelphia, just finished listening to episodes 7.55 of the

105
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,260
Charlie.

106
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,940
I could not stop laughing when I heard you play the team of America world police

107
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,060
I remember when I saw that in the theater, I would laugh so hard.

108
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,140
I think I was caught up alone.

109
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,980
It was so funny.

110
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,980
Great episode.

111
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,980
One of the say that I understand exactly what you meant by the comment that you

112
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,700
played about the individualism and you know, being so American.

113
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,300
And I think a lot of Europeans and Asians, they see that and they think that we

114
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,740
Americans are a bit off a rocker a bit crazy.

115
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,980
But that's just how we are.

116
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,020
That's how America was founded on crazy off the rocker people.

117
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,380
Individualism and focusing on, you know, making ourselves great.

118
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,180
However, it's, you know, not all that we do.

119
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,820
We do care about the rest of the world.

120
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,900
Although our current policy of President Bush is so crazy.

121
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,380
You don't even want to think about it.

122
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,060
But just to let you know, there's a lot of grass roots ever going around.

123
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,820
There's a lot of us in my area and my neck of the woods that we have support the

124
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,940
troops and the war.

125
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,380
We have signs on and along.

126
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,660
People know where we stand and what we believe.

127
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,580
So keep up the good work.

128
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,580
Thanks so much.

129
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,580
Great hair.

130
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,580
Hope you win.

131
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,580
No homo.

132
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,580
And unfortunately, only two times this week.

133
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,580
Hey, there.

134
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,260
I got my, my first mark on the board last night, actually, which technically was Sunday,

135
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,580
but we'll just count it with Monday.

136
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,860
So I'm one for five.

137
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,940
That means one down four more to go in the prostate cancer prevention quota, which, by the

138
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,420
way, is quota not quotient.

139
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,700
I was corrected on that just recently.

140
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,540
You know, five times a week, Jens, that will reduce your chance of prostate cancer by

141
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,540
60 to 70 percent.

142
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:29,180
Yeah, I do, you know, since you brought up the Bush administration as it still happens,

143
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,660
St. Clarence, sent me a link, which is from the LA Times.

144
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,940
It's called the government in secret.

145
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,300
And I'm going to put this link in the show notes at dailysourceco.com.

146
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,420
I really want you to read through this because as it turns out, there's a whole bunch

147
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:51,020
of laws that are being put into place that we have never seen or don't even have the

148
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,780
right, literally, to see these laws, a lot of it is executive order stuff.

149
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:01,860
And basically, if I understand this article properly, the president doesn't have to listen

150
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,980
to Congress at all based upon all these opinions of the Constitution.

151
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:13,140
I mean, this is what's really killing, killing us is these, you know, look, I, lots

152
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,100
of lawyers and my friends, J.T. Jersey, Todd, I hear you, all right, but bear with me.

153
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,420
But there's all these, in fact, what was the, was it a debate?

154
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,540
I can't remember, maybe it was even, it was Mitt Romney or someone said, oh, I have to

155
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,660
get, I'll have to consult with my attorney about that question.

156
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,700
It was probably about the guns or something like that.

157
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,260
But, you know, so the Constitution is being interpreted and reinterpreted and looked

158
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,100
at in so many different ways and I guess eventually you can find some kind of legal opinion

159
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,660
that will let you skirt around certain issues, fourth amendment is a, is a big one.

160
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,660
But please read this article.

161
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,340
It's too lengthy for me to, to get into it now, or even to read quotes from it.

162
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:04,020
But I think what we totally are getting screwed, it's not right.

163
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,620
Anyway, oh, here's the sound of America for you.

164
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:14,420
We're just having a deep choice.

165
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:21,700
You know, I don't, we're trying to explain last week, everybody was right in the New

166
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:27,020
American history and the Middle Beach.

167
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:34,060
Yes, you know, yeah, Sharon, I don't give a shit for you.

168
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,340
All right, Ravada.

169
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,500
Yeah, you don't give a shit now, man.

170
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,420
Wait until it's seven rate bucks a gallon.

171
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,900
Then you'll start talking.

172
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,980
But yes, indeed, the sound of Detroit

173
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,820
and Milwaukee Thunder, that is what America is built on.

174
00:13:44,820 --> 00:14:04,340
Hi, this is PWF, I've been doing digital flats

175
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,740
them for more than three years now.

176
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,180
And as unbelievable as it might seem, I have never made an official promo.

177
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,820
So this is my very first.

178
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:19,420
It is digital flats him about, oh, I don't know, about 25 minutes or so.

179
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,820
Check it out at digitalflatsom.org.

180
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:28,820
I personally guarantee it is the finest podcast you will ever hear, called Digital Flats.

181
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:44,300
Of course, one of my favorite shows available on the Mivio Network, obviously.

182
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,940
For those of you who've been listening, I've been more than a couple hundred episodes.

183
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,300
You'll know that mode Jones is one of my favorite bands in the whole wide world.

184
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
And this is one of them.

185
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,780
I sit down in a child, I've spent a while.

186
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,700
What did you do, where did you hang on?

187
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,740
I get lucky, living your love, have you finally found?

188
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:12,460
If you were trying to find, ever not a drink, the night's still young.

189
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,300
There's more one in the world only just me now.

190
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:22,860
As your mom and dad, do you still go strong when you see him say you've never dreamed of me wrong?

191
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:30,780
Bit of sweet taste, my cry, when I think about this time,

192
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:44,060
a piece of life, and a life to simple.

193
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:50,780
Drop the man, I don't want to hear, of course, it's sad out, what you want, shit,

194
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:56,780
I just can't imagine you being somebody's wife, feels like only yesterday,

195
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:02,780
and I saw you a life with a bit of sweet taste, my cry,

196
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:11,740
when I think about this time, a piece of life, and a life to simple.

197
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,820
I see you still do your hair, you're beautiful.

198
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,860
Is that, you?

199
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,620
This lack I can feel in.

200
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,420
I'm stuck in love.

201
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,180
It's your living room but the good things from now.

202
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:42,220
バня 이렇게裡je Something sure, yet I want no, to feel so,

203
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:48,060
if you laugh about it, that's another soul's, thickest.

204
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:55,060
When you think about this time of easy life

205
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:00,060
And love a simple

206
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,060
A bit of sweet taste

207
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,060
And I cry

208
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:11,060
When I think about this time of easy life

209
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:16,060
And love a simple

210
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,060
A bit of sweet taste

211
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,060
My cry

212
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:26,060
When I think about this time of easy life

213
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,060
And love a simple

214
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,060
Oh man

215
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,060
Is that a great song or what?

216
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,060
Skinny

217
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,060
Bit of sweet tears

218
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,060
So what I was going to say is that

219
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,060
I don't think mode Jones is broken up

220
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,060
But you know just listening to this track

221
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,060
Man, Skinny has gone off and done this solo project

222
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,060
And I'll put a link in the show notes

223
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,060
It's not on the podcast and music network

224
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,060
I'm trying to get them on

225
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,060
You can purchase actually about the whole CD

226
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:57,060
Which almost second is titled

227
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,060
My heart beats the moon

228
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,060
It's like five tracks, five or six tracks

229
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,060
But man, just awesome

230
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
And really it sounds like skinny

231
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,060
What really was the guy in mode Jones

232
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,060
Because you could have put mode Jones on the label

233
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,060
I wouldn't believe it

234
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,060
But wow, do I love that song

235
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,060
Bit of sweet tears

236
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,060
Okay, let me see

237
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,060
I got some really disturbing UK stuff

238
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,060
I want to get to

239
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,060
But first

240
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,060
This is me kind of important

241
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,060
I trust once to talk about influence

242
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,060
And what we can do in our lives

243
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,060
Hey, Curry.

244
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,060
Rust now I've seen been just thinking

245
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,060
But in the war I've said

246
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,060
I know agenda here about

247
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,060
Your influence

248
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,060
Effective about two people that seem on the Charlie

249
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,060
Yeah

250
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,060
If you haven't heard no agenda

251
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,060
No agenda.mevio.com

252
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,060
Episode was at 30

253
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,060
The one we did on Saturday

254
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,060
And talking about changing the world

255
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,060
And how we can we can make a change

256
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,060
With media

257
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,060
With our own free independent media

258
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,060
And the format was

259
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,060
A highly skeptical

260
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,060
And just eyes me saying

261
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,060
That there's only two people that I influence on this show

262
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,060
I beg to differ

263
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,060
And it's point I think is valid

264
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,060
You know, I mean I've tried to do my part

265
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,060
It's a couple of edge motivated

266
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,060
But you know, really what we consider success

267
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,060
You know, how much touching of people

268
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,060
But the songs are all

269
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,060
Do we really want to do you know

270
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,060
Before we got to count being successful

271
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,060
You know, I'm a writer

272
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,060
And I'm a poet of my spare time

273
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,060
And I've written several poems

274
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,060
About the state of America

275
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,060
To the state of the world

276
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,060
I've written

277
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,060
In a tourist

278
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,060
You know

279
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,060
People have agreed with some people

280
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,060
I've just agreed with them

281
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,060
You know, yeah, and I've had an effect

282
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,060
But you know, how do I measure that

283
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,060
To what standards am I living up to

284
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,060
A senator you living up to?

285
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,060
What can we define as

286
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,060
Yeah, we've touched somebody

287
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,060
But you know, that's a very good question

288
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,060
And I'll say that I

289
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,060
Consider it's success

290
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,060
If I reach out and touch

291
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,060
One person

292
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,060
If I can open one person's mind up

293
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,060
I'm not trying to convince anybody

294
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,060
If anything

295
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,060
I just want you to start thinking

296
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,060
Because man we are

297
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,060
The matrix

298
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,060
The movie was so right

299
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,060
Except of course not really

300
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,060
I don't think

301
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,060
We're not really jacked in

302
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,060
Line and pods

303
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,060
And our brains have just created

304
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,060
This imaginary world

305
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,060
But look at how

306
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,060
How far should we've become

307
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,060
We really are, you know, we're

308
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,060
We're obsessed with the celebrity gossip

309
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,060
And not with the things

310
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,060
Happening around us

311
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,060
So I measure that by one person

312
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,060
One person at a time

313
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,060
You being one of them

314
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,060
Rust by the way

315
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,060
And you should send us some of your poetry

316
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,060
I'd love to hear that

317
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,060
You know

318
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,060
Not enough of you

319
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,060
You thought about it

320
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,060
But they don't do anything about it

321
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,060
I don't think it does make him accountable

322
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,060
And unfortunately kind of

323
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,060
Believe it seems to have

324
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,060
Very little weight in this modern world

325
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,060
So

326
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,060
Where do we go from here, dude?

327
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,060
I think that's a good question

328
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,060
That these to be looked at is

329
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,060
What do we consider success

330
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,060
And what are we doing wrong

331
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,060
If all we've done so far

332
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
It's not motivated people

333
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,060
Like it's not it would

334
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,060
So that's my two cents

335
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,060
Yeah

336
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,060
Yeah

337
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,060
No sign off

338
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,060
No prostate cancer prevention quota

339
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,060
It's switching gears here

340
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,060
This is

341
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,060
Let me send this to me

342
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,060
Philip Clapham

343
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,060
He said me this awesome link

344
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,060
About this project that's going on in Australia

345
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,060
And you can find it

346
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,060
Let me just find the address for you

347
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,060
And via mission.com.au

348
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,060
Obviously I got a lot of links

349
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,060
Put in the show notes today

350
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,060
It's a new solar project

351
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,060
But it works a little differently

352
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,060
Than what I've seen so far

353
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,060
Essentially

354
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,060
There's this tube

355
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,060
I don't know what the diameter is

356
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,060
That sticks out of the ground

357
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,060
And it looks like it goes up several hundred feet

358
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,060
And it has

359
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,060
Some solar panels all around it

360
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,060
And when you see the diagram

361
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,060
Then you really understand what's happening

362
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,060
Essentially

363
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,060
The heat is being generated at the bottom

364
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,060
And then being pushed up through this tube

365
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,060
Because it's a tube

366
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,060
It's going up with a significant force

367
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,060
Enough to actually power turbines

368
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,060
And what is it?

369
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,060
200 megawatt power station

370
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,060
They have

371
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,060
I guess this is the first prototype

372
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,060
It provides enough electricity

373
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:35,060
To power about 200,000 typical Australian households

374
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:39,060
Of course I don't know exactly how much

375
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,060
Australian household uses

376
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,060
They might be a lot less than we use over here

377
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,060
But it really looks cool

378
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,060
And I think it's an awesome look

379
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,060
The force leads into

380
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,060
The search for all forms of alternative energy

381
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,060
Including nuclear

382
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,060
Which I am desperately trying to re-brand

383
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,060
To at least take away the negative connotations

384
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,060
As we figure out what we can do with the waste

385
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,060
And how safe is it?

386
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,060
And how much for turn an investment do you get?

387
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,060
And what are the pros and the cons?

388
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,060
Hey Adam

389
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,060
This is Marcus Novel who is the

390
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,060
Stokeshouse protest

391
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,060
And all of the 100% novel

392
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,060
It's more to a real quick space

393
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,060
Something about your wanting to re-brand nuclear energy

394
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,060
First that thought it sounded like a real cool idea

395
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,060
But what you think about isn't that really what

396
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,060
It's a politician view all the time

397
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,060
You know take some piece of legislation that they're really in favor for

398
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,060
Oh yeah, I know where this is going

399
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,060
Of course it's what politicians do

400
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,060
That's the whole point of branding

401
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,060
You want to give someone something to think about

402
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,060
Something that will stick in their mind

403
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,060
Obviously the idea of mushroom clouds

404
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,060
When it comes to atomic and nuclear energy

405
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,060
Isn't not exactly what we'd like people to be thinking about

406
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,060
If we decide to go that route

407
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,060
It's the public behind them

408
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,060
It's some really cool sounding name

409
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,060
They're taking it behind

410
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,060
You know, sort of like the old war on drugs

411
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,060
Yeah

412
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,060
For the same

413
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,060
I mean how about

414
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,060
We're just taking more factors

415
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,060
And educate people about what

416
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,060
If you're energy really isn't nice

417
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,060
It's not really an advantage you might think

418
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,060
Yeah

419
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,060
We're doing that

420
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,060
I'm trying to I just give you a

421
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,060
Education about these stove pipes in Australia

422
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,060
Hey Adam

423
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,060
This is Brian Chicago

424
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,060
I just wanted to give you I just had up on something

425
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,060
I want to want to recognize here a nuclear

426
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,060
Or radio act of discussion

427
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,060
You might want to check out a show

428
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,060
It's here in the States on show time

429
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,060
It's called 10 hours bullshit

430
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,060
And they have an episode about

431
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,060
Kind of a nuclear energy in your career

432
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,060
And create a huge number of videos of

433
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,060
How safe nuclear waste really is

434
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,060
I guess the storage of it

435
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,060
I don't check it out when you get a

436
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,060
Chat

437
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,060
Oh better way to get a good information

438
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,060
To them through the TV

439
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,060
One time listener

440
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,060
I might still say

441
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,060
Fuck you out

442
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,060
Oh oh oh

443
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,060
That hurt

444
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,060
Thank you

445
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,060
Yeah, I'm very familiar with the show

446
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,060
Haven't seen it in a while

447
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,060
I think it was running here in the UK for a bit

448
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,060
And then I kind of lost track of it

449
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,060
Of course I have show time in the condo

450
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,060
But I'm sure I can find that on YouTube

451
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,060
So I'll definitely have a look

452
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,060
And I'm not going to put that link into the

453
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,060
Into the show notes

454
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,060
You guys can find that one on your own

455
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,060
So the concept of rebranding

456
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,060
Was to

457
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,060
You know kind of coincide with the question

458
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,060
Can we put the nuclear waste on the moon?

459
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,060
And then of course rebranded moon juice

460
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,060
Because that's exactly what it will be

461
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,060
Turns out this is not a new idea

462
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,060
And the outcome and the results

463
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,060
Are pretty much predetermined

464
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:47,060
As is defined by the following comment

465
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,060
Hey Adam, how are greensteen from New York

466
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,060
Calling in about moon juice

467
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,060
It's amazing to me with all the sci-fi geeks

468
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,060
I listened to the daily source code

469
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,060
That no one busted out anything about space 1999

470
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:04,060
Well this show showed from 1975 to 77

471
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,060
In the U.S.

472
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,060
Was about an accident that occurred on September 13, 1999

473
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,060
Where nuclear waste had been stored on the moon

474
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,060
A catastrophic explosion sends the moon

475
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,060
Out of its orbit

476
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:21,060
And the 311 inhabitants of moon base alpha

477
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,060
Arturately

478
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,060
Uncontrollably into outer space

479
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,060
The series star Martin Landau

480
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,060
And Barbara Bay

481
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,060
Who had been stars admission in hospital at the time

482
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,060
Were married to each other

483
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,060
And this was a very popular show

484
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,060
But it was only shown in syndication

485
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
In various different markets in the U.S.

486
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,060
The music was cool and I have to say the effects for the time

487
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,060
Were very cool and I remember as a kid

488
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:48,060
Watching it on channel 11 in New York

489
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,060
So don't store nuclear waste on the moon dude

490
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,060
It's going to blow it up

491
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,060
Send it out of its orbit

492
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,060
And send all the people who are there working on the nuclear waste

493
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,060
Off into a mission in outer space

494
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,060
So they didn't want to go on

495
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,060
Just say it

496
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,060
All right

497
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,060
41

498
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,060
Folder

499
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,060
Whatever times a week

500
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,060
It seems to happen

501
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,060
Great hair

502
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,060
Love you

503
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,060
Mean it

504
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,060
Hope you win

505
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,060
Catch you soon

506
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,060

00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,060
That's pretty cool

00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060

Today the source code episode number

00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,060
I'm the 757 we'll be talking to an advertiser in a moment

540
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,060
Who's got something to say?

541
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,060
Which should be interesting

542
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,060
And this is also for the pod save music network

543
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,060
Loom your way to see these guys show up

544
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,060
And I am a woman

545
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,060
Oh but I know

546
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,060
Collective soul on the charlie

547
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,060
These ladies he days

548
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,060
I barely see myself through

549
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,060
While they hit cold up

550
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,060
My thoughts wrapped around you

551
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:21,060
I've got a lot of my thoughts

552
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,060
So I should never try

553
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,060
You're all that I know

554
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,060
You're the sun you're the star

555
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,060
You're all that I know

556
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,060
When the sun comes and run

557
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,060
And I never will be

558
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,060
You're the sun you're the star

559
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,060
You're sure to show

560
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,060
I'll be sure to show up

561
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,060
You're the sun you're the star

562
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:07,060
You're the sun you're the star

563
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,060
It's what I want to do

564
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:45,060
You're all that I know When the sun goes down, you're all that I know

565
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,060
When the sun goes rise like the devil in the heat

566
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:53,060
And when tomorrow I'll waste the shed to show

567
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:57,060
You're all that I know

568
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:12,340
You're all that I know

569
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,060
When the sun goes down, you're all that I know

570
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,060
When the sun goes rise like the devil in hearing

571
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:23,060
What the word is, it's just a show

572
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,060
You're all that I know When the sun goes down, you're all that I know

573
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,060
When the sun goes around like the devil in the heat

574
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:35,060
And when tomorrow I'll waste the shed to show

575
00:31:35,060 --> 00:32:03,740
I really want to thank the Promotions Company, the record label, and of course the

576
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:09,500
band themselves was supporting the pot-save music revolution, shared that shipman, and actually

577
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,500
sells more records.

578
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,800
I think the Promotions Company, the same one that put out the book, Cherry, record on the

579
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
pot-save music network.

580
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:20,300
So that is of course highly appreciated and love and a great great song.

581
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:25,100
Today's source code is brought to you, and part by E-music, you know, you can get 35 free

582
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:33,300
songs, absolutely no obligation, if you go to E-music.com slash daily source code.

583
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:38,740
You obviously can buy this track there.

584
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:43,140
They all have M-P-3's, no DRM, you couldn't use it on all your devices.

585
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:49,540
If I got to email from David, aka the Pimp Daddy, to add to my found thick freakness

586
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,020
and exotic dancer blues on E-music after I heard your recommendation of the service

587
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,860
on the DSC, I've been downloading tons of songs since then, thank you so much from the

588
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,860
Pimp Daddy.

589
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,860
Yep, another satisfied customer.

590
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:07,700
Not so entirely with the life insurance offer that I made for you, which was, I've been

591
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,700
talking about that for a couple of weeks now, accuquote.com slash DSC.

592
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:19,700
A lot of feedback, I was wondering why people weren't buying life insurance if they didn't

593
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,700
like the concept, if they don't care about life insurance, if you already have it, if you

594
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:30,140
don't like the sponsor, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on, because I thought

595
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,340
the uptake was very low when I thought a lot of people would be very interested in life

596
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,980
insurance, and maybe we should learn more about that.

597
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,580
I've got some, you can get up to 70% discount if you use acuquote.com, but let's get into

598
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:46,020
this, because there was some pushback and feedback that I want to talk about, specifically

599
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,020
as it relates to acuquote.

600
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,820
Hey, Adam, this is great from Minneapolis, first time calling on to the comment box.

601
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:57,300
Is that comment about the actual feedback you're looking for?

602
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:05,060
For me, the difference with this campaign, I was a felt a lot less like the advertisement

603
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:11,940
that I've been along the part of the show, the more I just took this small advertising

604
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,340
with some sale, even though it was a social sponsorship, and more recently, the Nokia

605
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:20,980
and the 110, I told him, engaged by the ongoing conversation about the products, how

606
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,580
was the natural part of the show, you talk about how you were using it, and it's so like

607
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,580
advertising.

608
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:30,660
I could just tell you the plug, anyway, that's my two cents, and I do already have a

609
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:37,940
couple of policies, one of the part of it, or at the other, my life set up, actually trying

610
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:45,780
to send me a message, anyway, here's my sign off, 34 years old, Mary, one kid, older,

611
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,900
girl, Fluggie's, we need it for her, for the one, and I currently pass it down to people,

612
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,900
too.

613
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,340
So, I prefer a word in the process.

614
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:57,780
You've got to hurry up, man, I think I was sent in last week, so hopefully it's a little

615
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,780
bit higher than that.

616
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,900
You've got to have at least five a week, dude, let's stay alive, protect yourself, okay?

617
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:08,620
So, now I feel kind of bad, you know, I'm thinking maybe I didn't do this right, because

618
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:12,460
I agree, you know, I try to make it advertising, and I like that phrase you use there.

619
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:18,700
I think that's a good way to integrate commercials and monetization, ways to make money,

620
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:25,540
ways to keep people going on doing this stuff, and yeah, I'm, maybe I'm, I am perhaps struggling

621
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,860
a little bit, you know, I'd love to hear anyone who's purchased life insurance recently,

622
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:34,380
what you're looking for, someone an expert, man, in fact, I have an expert, it's Mr.

623
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:41,220
Acute himself, who called into the voicemail line, let's hear from Shanchani from acucode.com.

624
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:47,260
Hi Adam, this is Shanchani, I had up all of the marketing for acucode, and I was just

625
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:53,700
listening to DSC 754, and there was a caller, Shon, who had gone to the site, had, you

626
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:59,620
just Jersey Todd's link, and when he went to the acucode site, thought that we were a referral

627
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,620
site.

628
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:05,940
I'm not sure exactly what he is interpretation of a referral site, I can't tell you that

629
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:11,500
acucode, we actually sell insurance, we sell life insurance from a variety of different

630
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:18,020
carriers, no matter, you know, whatever one is going to make the most sense for the consumer,

631
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:22,620
and we only represent the top rated companies that are price competitive, so he had a concern

632
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:28,900
that whatever company he uses for his auto insurance didn't show up in the comparison, and

633
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,300
the reason for that is most companies where you get your auto insurance, they're usually

634
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,420
significantly more expensive on the life insurance side, so for that reason we don't even

635
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:42,180
bother quoting them, we're only going to focus on the ones that are top rated from a financial

636
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:49,020
standpoint, and also price competitive, because if you're not saving money and getting

637
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:55,020
your life insurance from a top rated carrier, there's really no value proposition there.

638
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:01,420
So just wanted to clear that up, been very happy working with you guys over at Mivio,

639
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:06,540
a little bit about me, I'm age 35, married to kids, and I love everything you're doing

640
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,420
great here, and you're a winner.

641
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,660
Well, what is your prostate cancer prevention quotient?

642
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,900
Can we get a discount?

643
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:21,180
Okay, all right, here's your advertisement, Sean, Sean, Sean, if a daily source code listener

644
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:27,820
checks in, and it has to be the honor system, but I feel if we're doing five releases

645
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:34,140
a week, you know, keeping up the prostate cancer prevention quota up to five, we should

646
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,140
get a guaranteed 70% discount.

647
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,740
I mean, we're basically working for you then, we're trying to stay alive.

648
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:44,940
So let me know if we can set something up like that, where if you have, if you can prove

649
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:50,380
that you have a quota of five, you'll get a hit, I'll give it to you for free, if you

650
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,700
have a way to prove that.

651
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,940
All right, I got a wrap, I got so much to do tomorrow is a huge day.

652
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:04,060
We have a big party in London at the Shoreditch House, which is, it's really, it's late

653
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:08,660
in coming, but it's our coming out party as BT Podshow, which we are over here in the

654
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,140
UK, Mivio in the States.

655
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,500
And of course, this is where the partner British telecom, it's going to be a huge party,

656
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:21,820
all kinds of sea liberties and de-leberties, cool bands, we got cool DJs, we got free

657
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,700
booze, and lots of beautiful boys and girls.

658
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,700
I want more do you want?

659
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,060
It's going to be fun, but then there's all kinds of interviews and stuff I'm doing tomorrow,

660
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:33,460
so probably won't be able to eat out a show tomorrow morning because I got to be there relatively

661
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:39,140
early to start, I mean, it's a whole list, I mean, we got this PR from over here, that's

662
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:44,740
really been kicking ass, Kazoo, Kazoo's in the name, I'm sure there's a trademark issue in

663
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,740
there somewhere.

664
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:51,540
So I just want to leave you with one more for today from sales guy, you?

665
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:56,660
Hey Adam, so thank you, Chris for your.

666
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:02,500
My wife's telling me I'm starting to look old, get wrinkles, you know, tags on the my eyes,

667
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:07,940
so she told me today that I should go to a beauty shop somewhere and buy some products,

668
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:14,660
some cream, some moisturizer cream, whatever that's all gold, that could help me or help

669
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,060
my skin to rejuvenate.

670
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:21,300
Now I know you're a big product guy, you know, just, I think you, you've got a cream for

671
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:27,220
pretty much everything, any suggestions, any tips, you know, what should I buy?

672
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,740
I have no ID, man, the only product I use is the odorant and shampoo that's about all I got

673
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,740
right now.

674
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:40,420
Let me know, man, and don't give me those products that cost 500 euros, you know, for

675
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:46,740
you, the soup's bad, this, I need good quality products for a good payable price, you know,

676
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,740
what?

677
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,420
I think I'm turning into a Metro sexual, we're doing it, so.

678
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,980
Yo, sales guy, you, I'm so happy you brought this up because this gives me the opportunity

679
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:04,860
to bring out that old jingle, yes, ladies and gentlemen, Metro sexual, Metro sexual,

680
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:12,940
Metro sexual, Metro sexual, it's Adam Curry's Metro sexual moment, yes, everybody.

681
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,500
The fabulous Jeff Smith and the Jeff Smith.com, thanks so much, man, I still love this thing.

682
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,500
Sales guy, you, yes, I can tell you exactly what products you need, and you know what the good

683
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,540
thing is, you don't even need to go to the store to get them, my friend. No, you could stay at home,

684
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:37,580
you don't even have to take money out of your pocket, what you do is you go to your wife's medicine

685
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:42,940
cabinet or wherever she keeps all of her little creams and stuff, and you go in there and you look

686
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:49,260
for anything that says facial or moisturizer, combination of the two is even better, and the

687
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,980
smaller, the container, the more potent that shit is sales guy, you, so that's the stuff you want

688
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,860
to be using, and every single evening after you've washed your face or taken your shower,

689
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:04,300
whatever you want to moisturize your face, particularly under the eyes, with the excess,

690
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,820
you want to use that on your elbows and your knees, so you don't start cracking up,

691
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:13,180
and you repeat the same process in the morning. That is the official Adam Curry

692
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:18,300
cheap Jack asked tip to look in young and stay in healthy.

693
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,700
All right, everybody, that's it for today. Again tomorrow, big party, so I will be Twittering,

694
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,500
and I'll be posting stuff with the camera to the blog that'll be fun, so we do some live

695
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:38,540
blog and for you from the event at Shortage House, which is on the east side of London, where

696
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:43,980
everybody's weighed down with that, and back on Wednesday for a hump day show, so until then,

697
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:48,460
live your life with passion, it's certainly the weather for it, and while we still can,

698
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:53,580
enjoy your freedom. Another fine, medium presentation, stick it in your ear.
