00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
Alright, mevio, mevio, mevio, mevio, welcome to the Daily Source Code 753, brought to you by

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:35,760
the Daily Source Code 753, brought to you by the mevio.

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:45,760
Oh, well, here's the Daily Source Code 753, this is the Daily Source Code, the Daily Source Code.

4
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,760
Oh, well, here's the Daily Source Code, the Daily Source Code, the Daily Source Code.

5
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Oh, well, here's the Daily Source Code, the Daily Source Code.

6
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,760
Oh, well, here's the Daily Source Code, the Daily Source Code, the Daily Source Code.

7
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:45,760
Oh, well, here's the Daily Source Code, the Daily Source Code, the Daily Source Code.

8
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:29,760
Oh, man, it could not be a better song to start this journey off with.

9
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Oh, man, you know, it just goes from bad to worse.

10
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:55,760
I've talked with you guys about the 50 billion, that's $100 billion dollar.

11
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,760
The 50 billion, that's $100 billion dollar bailout of the banks here in the United Kingdom.

12
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,760
And the way that they're doing that is quite different from what's happening in the U.S. with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, just to summarize,

13
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:19,760
is basically going to make 50 billion pounds worth of bonds, government bonds available more than they've ever issued, by the way, as far as I can tell.

14
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:27,760
And they will swap those bonds with the bad debt that the banks have, and they'll let them hold onto those bonds for three years.

15
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Okay, so that's the decision the current Gordon Brown government has made.

16
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,760
However, this article has been sent to me by at least 15 different people.

17
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,760
It's originally from the Mail on Sunday, written by Dan Atkinson and Simon Watkins.

18
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:55,760
Here's the deal. The Bank of England has apparently imposed a permanent news blackout on this 50 billion pound plan to ease the credit crunch.

19
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,760
So they're going to love this.

20
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,760
So they're not going to disclose the names of the banks that borrow money.

21
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,760
In fact, it will not be available under a Freedom of Information Act request.

22
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:17,760
Even after the 30-year period, which most all-sensor state documents are eventually revealed, employees who break the contract,

23
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:26,760
if they name any of the institutions at the Bank of England, I think they'll be drawn and quartered, and then perhaps even beheaded.

24
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,760
Now, I understand why they're keeping this secrecy, okay, because it's all about trust.

25
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,760
We're going through this before these banks are in so much trouble. And by the way, this really has nothing to do with the United States.

26
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:46,760
The UK did just fine on their own with their own little credit crunch and they're trading with everybody around the world.

27
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,760
So it's not like a US fever that's flowing over here. No, it's structurally wrong here as well.

28
00:05:52,760 --> 00:06:00,760
Of course, the banks don't trust each other because they don't understand how much value they're securities actually have.

29
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Or securities, the investment vehicles that are backed by mortgages. So no one wants to trade against them.

30
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,760
So of course, to keep trade going, that's where the government bonds come in because they're guaranteed and they have a value that'll be good.

31
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Okay, that makes sense. Now, to not disclose those names, is a part of that trust factor because any bank that borrow or that does the swap,

32
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,760
and essentially says, please bank help me out, bank of England, please help me out, give me your bonds.

33
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:37,760
We'll look weak. So instead of all open kimonos, which I think would have been a much, much better idea. Still, I can understand it has to be done secrecy.

34
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Okay, fine. What it really shows me though is how bad this problem has become. It has gotten so bad that the banks are going to the mother ship and saying, oh, well, let's keep it quiet because it's, we really don't want anyone else to know.

35
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,760
It's going so much trouble.

36
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,760
In Germany, they do it a whole different way. I think that they got the right idea over there.

37
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Deutsche Bank, let me just bring up this article. This is hilarious.

38
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,760
What can I open this? Hello, here we go. You're going to like this.

39
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest has been hit by the global credit crunch so badly. This is how bad it is in Germany.

40
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:27,760
It is issued a memorandum to senior executives telling them that brothel visits and adult channels in hotel rooms cannot be claimed on expenses.

41
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:35,760
Damn it. Damn that credit crunch. We can't go to the hookers anymore.

42
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:42,760
Anyway, this is all part of the government we deserve here in the United Kingdom speaking of which, you know, that is not my quote.

43
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:51,760
I didn't make it up and I've mentioned this before and Chris was kind enough to try and find the origin of this statement or quote, whatever you want to call it,

44
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,760
that every country gets the government it deserves because it is one of today's topics on the Charlie.

45
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Hey, and this is Chris Thompson, so that's here. I look into some of the quotes you're using.

46
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,760
Demoxy people get the government to deserve.

47
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:19,760
That's often attributed to Alexis de Tocqueville, who is the French philosopher who visited America and wrote the book at Demoxy in America.

48
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:27,760
But I was searching through I can't actually find a source for that quote. It may just be one of those false quotes that history comes up with.

49
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
It's also an attributed to Jefferson.

50
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,760
And there's a little more another quote out there.

51
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Demoxy is a system that ensures people are governed no better than they deserve or are governed the way they deserve.

52
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,760
That's by George Bernard Shaw, another unsourced quote.

53
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,760
So it's an interesting idea.

54
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,760
I just hate when you throw it on someone.

55
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,760
So I'm going to quote Adam Curry saying that the government didn't get the government to deserve because I heard you say it.

56
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
So I quote it.

57
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
And I agree with you.

58
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,760
You got to rise up, but man, that path, that's a troubled one.

59
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:17,760
You know, you know, Gandhi, you can ask dumb, I'm blanking.

60
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,760
But yeah, that's rough one.

61
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,760
So I appreciate the work.

62
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,760
You're blanking on some heroes, blanking on people who you can ask how hard it is.

63
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:41,760
How about Julian Aviles, Kyle Crowley, Estrella Soto, Jason Franco, Leslie D. Jackson, Bradley G.

64
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Critzer, Michael G. Milakoulis, Anthony P. Roberts, Eric R. Seager, Nathan Z. Thacker, Steven J. Wallberg.

65
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,760
You know, with these are these kids, these are 18 year old kids.

66
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,760
The Washington Post has a site called The Faces of the Fallen.

67
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,760
And they give it to you right there.

68
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,760
You can even categorize our dead kids by age.

69
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
These are all 18 year olds.

70
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
I'd say they understand how hard it is.

71
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Did they get the government they deserve?

72
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,760
Did the government they deserve to treat them well?

73
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
It's time to think about some uprising, my friends.

74
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,760
The shit is out of control and not right.

75
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Not just here, overseas.

76
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Probably everywhere.

77
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
Hey, Kerry.

78
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Rust and Washington.

79
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Check it out, chuckle heads.

80
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,760
You'll keep bitching about sign on how people don't have a voice or a ability to evote.

81
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Oh, yeah, that may be true today.

82
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
I guess what?

83
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,760
When a communist revolution took hold, that was kind of the will of the people.

84
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,760
So yeah, right now they might have screwed themselves out of liberty.

85
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,760
But they got themselves there in the first place.

86
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,760
So let's not be so bleeding hard on the Chinese.

87
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,760
It may not be the generation today, but their previous generation led them to there.

88
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,760
And that's why we, the current generation, may not do that to our own future generations here in American Britain.

89
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,760
So there's a little factoid for all you chuckle heads.

90
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,760
So an official historian here set in the record straight piece.

91
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,760
Oh, we have an official historian, excellent.

92
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,760
Yeah, yeah.

93
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,760
It really is true.

94
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
You know, I got compassion, man.

95
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,760
I got compassion for all people of the world.

96
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:38,760
When a brother or a sister who is hurting in Africa or China or Tibet or South America or North America or Europe or the Middle East,

97
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
it all hurts.

98
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
We're all people.

99
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,760
This is the thing that we've come to understand.

100
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,760
This is the only thing that the internet has really really done well at.

101
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,760
It's connecting us and letting us share ideas and thoughts and forget everything else.

102
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,760
You know, I know lots of people in Iran now.

103
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,760
I know people in China that I never would have known before.

104
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
I don't understand.

105
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
I don't have any problem with them.

106
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
So we clearly got to fix our own houses.

107
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,760
That's what we got to do.

108
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
And man, we got a lot of work to do.

109
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,760
Some good responses, though yesterday to the conversation.

110
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,760
And I'm so happy to hear Jay Mack coming back.

111
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:19,760
Jay Mack, who was really laying into me about the government they deserve and the China had absolutely no chance

112
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,760
to change the ways of their government.

113
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,760
And by the way, we're not showing a very good example ourselves.

114
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,760
I might point out.

115
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
But Jay Mack's come back and just thought about it.

116
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,760
Mr. Curry, Jay Mack, I'm put aside.

117
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,760
I'm by the way, dude.

118
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,760
I mean, I know I'm 43 and all, but the Mr. Curry thing, that hurts.

119
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,760
I just wanted to call you and say thank you.

120
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
You were right.

121
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,760
I really, what I envisioned in my head when you had said the thing about China, the Chinese,

122
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,760
get the government, they deserve and you know,

123
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,760
they need to rise up and over throw the government and this and that.

124
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,760
You know, in my head I was envisioning, you know,

125
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:11,760
poverty-stricken, you know, peasants and people with sticks and stones trying to go up against tanks and Jackson.

126
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,760
You know, I guess I really never took into consideration exactly what you had said,

127
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,760
which was the, you know, like the kid in front of the tank and Tiananmen square with the, you know,

128
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
the symbolism of it all.

129
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,760
And you know, if people really did start to revolt against their government and there really was, you know,

130
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,760
math, math, death, you know, occurring.

131
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,760
You know, it's not too far fetched to think that someone like the United States would come in and assist and, you know,

132
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,760
stuff like that. I guess, I guess I was being a little bit shallow on the comment.

133
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,760
You kind of got to me right away and I jumped on it without thinking it through thoroughly.

134
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,760
So thank you very much. It's a very good point and I stand very, very, very, very corrected.

135
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
On the whole other,

136
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
uh, hold on a second before you get to the other thing.

137
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,760
Jay Mack, thanks, man.

138
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
Uh, it's not about standing corrected.

139
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Uh, I'm not entirely 100% right.

140
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,760
And I'm just talking out of my ass too.

141
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,760
However, it's a cool that we were communicating, man.

142
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
And, uh, yeah.

143
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
I'm just saying.

144
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
End of the spectrum, man.

145
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
I got a quick question.

146
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,760
What the hell do you use for digital recorder?

147
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Because, um, okay.

148
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,760
We use a computer to record everything and it's fucking sucks, man,

149
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,760
because everything keeps coming out, uh,

150
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
distorted and shit.

151
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
So, yeah, man.

152
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,760
Just to get you two fucking things from completely different ends of this spectrum,

153
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,760
have fun with it, man.

154
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
Take it easy.

155
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
Hi, Jay Mack.

156
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760

157
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Everybody go check out Jay Mack's work.

158
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Um, so let me answer that second question.

159
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,760
Unequivocably unequivocalic.

160
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Uh, without a doubt.

161
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,760
If you're on windows, check out castblaster, castblaster.com.

162
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Uh, when I was on windows or whenever I find myself on windows,

163
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
that is the program of choice.

164
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,760
It's extra cool because it has an automatic upload to, uh,

165
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
to the media servers that features baked right in.

166
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,760
Uh, so I would recommend that above all.

167
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,760
And there's different ways to set it up, um,

168
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,760
and the way I've always used it is with an external mixer.

169
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Now, um, I've been on a quest for about four and a half years now

170
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
to get everything.

171
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
All in one box on a Mac.

172
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Uh, because it is my computer of choice.

173
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
I like it that much more.

174
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Um, it's, uh, never quite been powerful enough to run all the shit

175
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
that I want to at the same time.

176
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,760
And there's been huge latency problems with getting audio in

177
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,760
and listening to the live signal.

178
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
And I've got all of that solve, J Mac.

179
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,760
Uh, CC Chapman was asking me about this the other day as well.

180
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,760
I put a picture up on curry dot com, uh, which you can find

181
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
the web blog there.

182
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,760
Uh, and you'll see it's a flicker picture of, uh, my setup,

183
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,760
which is I said I've moved it off of the, uh, kind of the production area,

184
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,760
which is still filled with mixers and all kinds of stuff.

185
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,760
I just wanted to clean environment, two screens, uh,

186
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,760
everything software and all I wanted external was just a little

187
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
MIDI controller, which I have, which is that fader fox box.

188
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,760
You'll see on the left, uh, the picture.

189
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,760
And what I still am planning is to do a screencast.

190
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,760
Now it's going to take a lot of work.

191
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,760
And I've already set some stuff up of done some trials,

192
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,760
because I have to do like picture and picture,

193
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,760
because I have to show you, um, how things work externally,

194
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,760
how they drive the software internally.

195
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,760
So it is coming and all the specs will be written up and, uh,

196
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,760
and then everyone can go and, uh, put these things together.

197
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,760
That's by the way, ordered a second fader fox device.

198
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,760
So I already have the six faders, which is the MIDI controller for the software

199
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
for Ableton Live.

200
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,760
I ordered, uh, I think it's the L, X, or LD2 or something.

201
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,760
And it's basically an identical, beautiful little box.

202
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,760
Only it has just rows and rows of buttons and lights.

203
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
We keep linking lights.

204
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
And I'll be using that to fire off, uh,

205
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,760
all of the carts and the voice mails, etc.

206
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,760
So, uh, maybe I'll wait until I have that in,

207
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,760
because it's like six or seven different pieces of software.

208
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,760
All running together and, uh, eventually we can bundle these all up

209
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,760
in one big tar ball or one big script, I think,

210
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
and, uh, be able to distribute it.

211
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,760
I hope it would be nice, because it does work and I'm very, very happy to share.

212
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,760
Hey, still, it's cool.

213
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,760
But yeah, if, uh, we'll try that again.

214
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Hey, it's daily source code episode 753.

215
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,760
I had a bit of a map from Gang's Weasel.

216
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,760
Hope you're very well, sir.

217
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,760
On this week's show, we've got a review of Time Crisis 4 on the PS3.

218
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Also on the DS, we've got the World Ends with you, a strange one there.

219
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,760
You can also win copies of Iron Man for the Nintendo DS,

220
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,760
and we've got an exclusive behind the scenes feature.

221
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
That's all at Gang'sWeasel.com.

222
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,760
There's what the third one of every set.

223
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,760
Now that's bullshit.

224
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Now you go for a World End.

225
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
Now that's bullshit.

226
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
You can't check this number, not in length.

227
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
Now that's bullshit.

228
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,760
Then you paint, talk to what you spin.

229
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Now that's bullshit.

230
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
Then you even got a paint, talk to your pen.

231
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Now that's bullshit.

232
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
There's still one to take you in here.

233
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
Now that's bullshit.

234
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
English kids, wrapping them every night.

235
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
Now that's bullshit.

236
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
It's bullshit.

237
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,760
It's bullshit.

238
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
Extending the congestion genre.

239
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,760
Now that's bullshit.

240
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Now that's bullshit.

241
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Now that's bullshit.

242
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
Most of what you learn in class.

243
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
Now that's bullshit.

244
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
Especially recording the part.

245
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
Now that's bullshit.

246
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,760
Maybe in the funny spot.

247
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
Now that's bullshit.

248
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
You can choose but you ain't got a heart.

249
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,760
Now that's bullshit.

250
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Every single single bullet can make a mouth.

251
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Now that's bullshit.

252
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,760
The worst bullshit is bullshit.

253
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
It's bullshit.

254
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,760
Now that's bullshit.

255
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
Now that's bullshit.

256
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,760
Now that's bullshit.

257
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,760
Now that's bullshit.

258
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,760
Now that's bullshit.

259
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
Now that's bullshit.

260
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
Now that's bullshit.

261
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
Now that's bullshit.

262
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Now that's bullshit.

263
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,760
Now that's bullshit.

264
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
All the tissues talk.

265
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Now that's bullshit.

266
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
It's bullshit.

267
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760

335
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,760
Look what we do to our mothers, that's bullshit

336
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Hell yeah

337
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,720
All the tissues don't never do shit, it's bullshit

338
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,200
All the way, they feed us in the news, it's bullshit

339
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,720
Plus what they teach us in the schools, it's bullshit

340
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,240
The world's bullshit, it's all bullshit, bullshit

341
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,840
All the tissues don't never do shit, it's bullshit

342
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,440
All the way, they feed us in the news, it's bullshit

343
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,600
Plus what they teach us in the...

344
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,840
There you go, it's not spritz, it's bullshit, they're pissed off

345
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,040
It's all bullshit

346
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,000
Yes, bullshit, and I wish I knew who that was by

347
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,080
It was just dropped in the daily source code

348
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,320
Drop a drop.au slash daily source code

349
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
Which of course is completely anonymous

350
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,320
And if you drop something in, please add a little note

351
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,760
With at least tell me who's performing it, you know?

352
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,640
Oh, I got as a file name, not good enough

353
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,240
Because I want to give credit where creditors do

354
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,480
I really like the way that came off

355
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
Hey, let's continue on this trip

356
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,120
Adam Bigger, I'll ask you a second round

357
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,600
About anyway, my point is, everybody's wanting to talk and complain about things

358
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,040
Including people like you who have a ability to influence large volumes of people

359
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,320
But yet, nobody's willing to upset their state of affairs

360
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,760
They like to drive their nice cars, they like to have their nice electronics

361
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,520
And their nice quality of life

362
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,720
If we really, really believe we have problems

363
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,880
Then we have to be willing to make sacrifices

364
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,080
And that's part of the people in the best position

365
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,240
To influence others, and that's people like you

366
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,720
So, hey, put your money where your mouth is

367
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,840
I'd love you anyway, great hair, hope you'll win

368
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,360
44 married, two kids, teenagers

369
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,000
And three times a week, one I have to

370
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,960
I'll be later

371
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,320
Man, you'll be down too on the prostate prevention

372
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,440
Quotion, you need five, man, you need five, I'm at four for this week

373
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
So, I'm doing okay so far

374
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,280
If you don't know what that's about

375
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,840
You might want to go back to episodes and listen to

376
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,040
What that is, it could save your life

377
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,240
Yeah, man, you true, absolutely

378
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,200
By the way, I'm not quite sure what you mean by put my money where my mouth is

379
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,720
I think I'm doing that

380
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,920
I'm here to try and influence, I think I'm doing that

381
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,080
But you're right, you know, you're absolutely right

382
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,080
And you know what, we've got, we've got people who stand up in our country

383
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,560
And I just mentioned a whole bunch of those names, they're dead

384
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,240
All right, and if we're willing to send

385
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,360
We have to be willing to die for the same causes

386
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,360
I do agree with you there, if we're willing to send our kids 18-year-olds off into

387
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,120
Deserts and mountains to get shot at and possibly maimed or killed

388
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
Aren't we responsible? Don't we have

389
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,160
Responsibility to be just as ready to do that here at home?

390
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
I certainly, I certainly feel so

391
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,920
And of course, I'm a little torn because I have two homes

392
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,880
It makes me

393
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,920
Be kind of queasy to think

394
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,880
I should have to do

395
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,880
But right now I'm doing what I can do

396
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,480
But I'm old enough to say I think I am prepared to really stand up

397
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,040
But nothing has really been organized right just yet

398
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,520
And I'm hoping one day I'll stumble upon that and we'll get something going

399
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,520
It can't be far off because I can just feel that people are getting a little bit antsy

400
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,400
But stuff is not working exactly the way everybody wants

401
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,040
And a lot of that has to do of course with how we're being raped by the by the big oil companies

402
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,160
How they're taking all these wonderful profits and

403
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
literally

404
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,680
Literally

405
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,360
Screwing us sticking us with the bill. There are solutions though when we've got some months to help us out here on the daily source code

406
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,320
Adam

407
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,280
I think for God that you have an energy savant for the Charlie

408
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:00,000
Two days was a talking about energy crisis oil company profits biofuels and money

409
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,880
And not even a call out for atomic rod atoms. I am so hurt

410
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:11,120
Your gold bugs a lot of many about currency. But he has a little idea about what really makes the world work

411
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,800
If oil cost

412
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,320
120 dollars per barrel that daily value of oil transactions total more than 10

413
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,400
Building and dollars

414
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,400
That does not even include the amount this bent to transport refined and distributed to oil products

415
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,960
And it completely ignores the other fossil fuels like coal and natural gas

416
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:37,280
If we really want an energy alternative we have to stop thinking that the sun and wind are going to do the job

417
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,640
And look around to see what has proven that can replace gas and coal

418
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,560
Electrical power plants and oil on board ships and submarines like the ones I used to operate

419
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Vision is the way of the future

420
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,240
But we have to work together to get the notion past the oil coal and gas companies

421
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:02,240
They are pretty darn happy with the way things are if you want to learn more visit atomic insights

422
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:10,160
Or the atomic fuel go blue go atomic folder blue feel great there hope we all went love you meet more than five

423
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,720
Possibly protect your freedom and seek the truth behind the news

424
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,720
Ha ha

425
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Dominic Rod everybody

426
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Hey, you know, I'm still waiting for my backyard nuked dude. I'm I'm way on board with that

427
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:31,440
I think that we've certainly improved the technology enough to use it and it is a stigma that is that lies on the whole nuclear or atomic

428
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
Just those two words in general

429
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,240
Obviously have really horrible connotations

430
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,000
I like you said so you said efficient in there earlier, which of course is probably the

431
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
The technical term for

432
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:49,040
For this process what if we could bastardize that a bit what if we called it fusion set of fish and it can we technically do that?

433
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,080
We just say fusion because fusion fusion energy you know that sounds kind of sexy

434
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,080
It sounds like you know like melding together and fusion

435
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,920
It's as a multicultural type vibe

436
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:05,600
We need to rebrand atomic and nuclear energy, okay, so let's work on that part first and then of course

437
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,280
There's no incentive for big oil companies to and and the governments that that subsidize them

438
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,560
Because they're all in the same boat together, so I did it may very well be that we have a fantastic solution right there at a fingertips

439
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,120
And and correctly if I'm wrong rod and I love that you're making it under a minute and a half these days, but

440
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,480
isn't fusion a lot cleaner wouldn't that help with the

441
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,280
Climate change and all those other issues that were so incredibly worried about I mean

442
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,360
Sounds like there may be a campaign to mount there and we'd have to draft some really smart people

443
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,760
Stuff to think about for sure that's wrap it up with this one. This is this is from a couple weeks

444
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,360
Actually, yeah a couple weeks ago and you know I keep all these voice comments and

445
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,200
And sometimes I just roll them out when I feel let's appropriate

446
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,760
Like because we use blackberries and not so much and we're

447
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,520
Accessible on email so listen my friend. I don't use that stuff

448
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:23,840
I like my email and my computer, but I don't need to take it with me and I don't ever feel the need to answer every email that comes my way

449
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,160
People send stuff and it can wait so small if there's even if there's stuff to work

450
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,720
I might look at it. I might not log in some time back the next day

451
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,320
Cares it's just our own business whether or not we answer emails all the time

452
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,560
We do not have to be a slave to people to say answer my email

453
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,240
Unless somehow your boss says you have to in which case

454
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,920
You know, I guess you don't have to work for them anymore. Do you just before my friend, but that's where I'm coming from

455
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
Make very much all the good

456
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,920
Like to hear to you. All right. Bye. Yeah. Absolutely

457
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,640
You know, I've started doing a lot of that. I've started doing a lot of just not answering email because the you know my rule is the less you send the

458
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,800
Let's you receive and that really does hold true. It is truly a law of physics somehow

459
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
And I've also stopped

460
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,720
We've talked about this before. You know, I go to the Google News site and lately it was I'll do it with you for it as an example

461
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,080
Just to show you how I save time and aggravation throughout my day because

462
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,600
Man, you just got to hear Google news. I'll show you what what do we have on Google news today is the headlines

463
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
Which of course is it's the only news?

464
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,960
US economy expanded in 0.6% pace. I might read that when GM post big loss as US sales hurt

465
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,640
Might not click on that here's the stuff all

466
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
I'll definitely miss

467
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
Miley Cyrus should apologize

468
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Gary Durdand bust and loose from CSI

469
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,560
Prince Williams afghan flight a PR exercise

470
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,600
You know that kind of shit. Don't waste your time on that just if you read the headline you know what the story is gonna be

471
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,760
You know don't worry you won't look incredibly stupid in fact

472
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,920
I you know when you're at a cocktail party and you don't know the latest Amy wine house room roomer

473
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,480
I think you can you can chill out because

474
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,040
I'm finding more and more the people are very interested in very willing to speak about

475
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,560
some of the topics that we talk about right here on the daily source code

476
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,280
In fact I got some kind of exciting news. I told you earlier that earlier in the week that

477
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,440
British telecom was going to be installing some lines here at the house now these are digital

478
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,080
digital lines which would be hooked up to some high-tech

479
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,400
gear

480
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:45,600
Basically for anyone who technically wants know what it is. It's ISD headlines and I'll have a what is known as a codec

481
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,160
And that's that's actually a box that has the software. It's the software and the hardware all in one

482
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:56,480
So I can establish a high quality connection between here and the Netherlands because check this out

483
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
There's a guy who

484
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,080
My phone ring in there. No, there's a guy in the Netherlands who's and he's kind of an interesting guy

485
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
He's been around for a long time

486
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
He's about my age

487
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:15,040
There you go. Been around for a long time and he's he's purchased some FM frequencies and

488
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,400
These things are not cheap so I'm not going to share how he's doing it where he's getting the money from but he's he's got a real

489
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,880
Pirate radio vibe about him and he's been listening to the daily source code for a number of years

490
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,400
And he said you know Adam I believe you know podcasting in the Netherlands is not big

491
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,080
And the reason why is because they're oversaturated with radio stations

492
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,120
But you know, there's a huge gap in between the

493
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Everybody good morning

494
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,120
I was bang on the drum all day morning shows

495
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:52,880
Where we're laughing about popular culture and then what they considered to be news radio and and this with 15 stations in a country with only

496
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,920
16 or 17 million people and the size of Rhode Island

497
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,560
That's a lot of media a lot of media to consume when I guess that people

498
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,480
Feel they have enough where there's this huge hole and I believe well actually so this guy approached me

499
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,120
I can tell you who he is right right at this moment and he said I believe this format that you have on a daily source code

500
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,880
Will translate into a local market in radio

501
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,160
You know the the idea of bringing up topics that

502
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,960
30 to 40 year olds care about and luckily some 20 or even younger

503
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:32,880
Your old like and he wants to try and experiment and I got to tell you my my crush is itchen to do this

504
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
So he wants me to contribute to

505
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
To a show it'll be a morning show

506
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,720
And of course, I'm not going to go live in the Netherlands so I said yeah

507
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,920
I can do it from here

508
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,000
We're wherever you know shouldn't be much for a problem. We've got connections. You know we can do it over the internet

509
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,360
We can do it through a high

510
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,840
High quality line that should be no problem. So we're spinning that up and we're going to test these lines out

511
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,800
And then we're going to you know work be work on the format, but literally the format that we've developed together

512
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,400
We're going to try out on terrestrial broadcast radio. I'm pretty excited about it because if it works there

513
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Well, then I'm just my work in many other places

514
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,920
And as you know, it's not necessarily about the distributions about the ideas the thoughts the interaction and the community at least that's what it is for me

515
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,000
To anyway, so no one knows oh no one has heard about that yet. It's it's been kind of my secret project

516
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,080
But I want you guys to be the first to know that that's going on and of course it will not affect the daily source code or no agenda

517
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
Because I love that shit way too much

518
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,800
That's mellow and out of and holding on to this song for a couple of weeks it showed up on the drop the baked potato blues

519
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,440
Chill out enjoy

520
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,880
Plains

521
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,960
Lots of baked potato

522
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Butter and me up and down to now, God

523
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Oh, I've got a big but shadow blue

524
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:37,920
Butter and me up and down to now, God

525
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:49,920
You can fall me back, me but don't mistake me

526
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Life is falling down, it's been like a sun

527
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:05,920
You take me through the town

528
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:17,920
You wrap me up and fall

529
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,920
Take me home and put me in a bag then

530
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:31,920
So I don't fall down

531
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,920
You're like a potato that ain't no job

532
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,920
Lots of butter sell, I could even try

533

I'm talking to my skin, stop me once, stop me twice, stop me three times

564
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:13,920
And through some day, my life will be gone

Ah, they never had particularly do they?

566
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,920
Take potato blues.

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,920
Yeah!

568
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,920
Yeah, not just don't hear enough of that on the radio, not do ya.

569
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,920
Absolutely not.

570
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,920
All right everybody, that's it for the Daily Source Code episode 753.

571
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,920
Thanks everybody, by the way, who congratulated me on 750, that kind of kicked in earlier this week,

572
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,920
even though we're now up to 7503.

573
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Doesn't look like I'll be able to do a show tomorrow, probably not Friday.

574
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Either some company my lovely wife to, to her first live show as I already mentioned before.

575
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,920
Definitely a no agenda this weekend.

576
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,920
You can look forward to that in next week.

577
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,920
Looks like I'll be here, but you never know where I could show up.

578
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,920
So please think about all the things we've talked about,

579
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,920
and if you're walking around healthy and free,

580
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,920
I live your life with passion and enjoy that freedom.

581
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,920
Another fine, medium presentation.

582
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
Share it with a friend.
