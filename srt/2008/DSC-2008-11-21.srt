Delta Sierra Charlie 806

00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,280

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,280
I'm dancing

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,280
It's a very beautiful sunset

7
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,280
It was routine

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,280
I love you back

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,280
I need no coffee in my room

A night

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,280

Look that way, let the child get made my day a little bit

What makes it a little bit, what makes it a little bit

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,280
What makes it a little bit, what makes it a little bit

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:52,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

54
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:13,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come to the toilet.

55
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:22,500
Hey everybody, how you doing? Welcome to the Charlie episode number 800 and sex coming to you from the affluent suburb of Suri known as gulford

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,740
Where the weather is not nice at all. It's a blustery

57
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,780
We would say lots of win, which is why I'm here and not on my way to the Netherlands

58
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,780
I was going to join my bride lady Patricia for

59
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,260
Her Friday night live show. I thought I'd go hang out there and look important kick tires

60
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,620
You know

61
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,420
With nothing to do except get my wife water and a protector dressing room door

62
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,420
Which I love doing carrying her bag

63
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,420
But yeah, it's just shit. It really is this like gusting 40 knots. So

64
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,100
You know

65
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,220
Certainly something I could fly through but why bother and it may not be much better tomorrow

66
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,460
Either anyway that gives us the perfect opportunity to roll out the second daily source code this week

67
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:12,540
Check it out. What's been happening since last we spoke which was Tuesday. Oh, Wednesday. Of course. This was the big

68
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,780
The first piece of monument monumental effort. I had to put into the ring here

69
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,700
As a part of the move to the new concept, which it is as of yet unnamed

70
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,100
I kind of like curry terrace

71
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,100
Because it is a terrace house or as they say an end of terrace house

72
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,300
It's on a square so I kind of like curry square

73
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,460
We got to think about that

74
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,820
But anyway, that's coming up. You know by I think December 29th we're moved into the new place. So

75
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,420
Besides start to clean up my crap upstairs here on the third floor of the manner

76
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,100
Which I've really been putting a lot of thought into it and I've pretty much

77
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:01,540
Decided that it's just going to be one 19 inch rack. I'm gonna finally break down and buy an actual rack probably one that's enclosed like a case

78
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,260
As long as I've good access to the rear panels

79
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,580
Put the stuff in there that I actually want which is really only

80
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,860
Maybe five pieces of gear stuff that is just great outboard gear that I know

81
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,300
I'm gonna need you know when Patricia wants to do something and then I won't have it

82
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,900
I have one two three five mixers currently up here in use

83
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,140
Which is ridiculous so I'm gonna break that down. I'm gonna bring it back to one

84
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,780
One mixing console which will be the Yamaha MG124 CX

85
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,660
Charlie X ray

86
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,180
Because that can pretty much do everything I want and then for the rest it's

87
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,340
It's all gonna be digital

88
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,700
I mean right now I'm 100% digital on

89
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,180
Creating the daily source code as well as no agenda

90
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:56,540
There's no external gear whatsoever except for a headphone and microphone and the microphone of course that I'm using is this love mic

91
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,660
Which just for some reason has fantastic dynamics and I until I get everything into the new place

92
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,100
I'm just gonna use this sit up and then I'll really start working on

93
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,820
unfixing all the all the sound and ground loops and God what else have you

94
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:19,020
So of course on wins that we had to go to storage and this is amazing because we've had stuff in this storage

95
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,140
Since we moved to the United Kingdom, so that's been

96
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,460
Working on four years now for almost five years

97
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,980
And I didn't miss a single thing. I knew there was stuff there that I wanted to keep and I had these long drawn out

98
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,420
Conversations with Patricia and I was like well, what do you keep and what don't you keep this?

99
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:42,140
You know, there are things and nicknaps and pictures and books and stuff that I hope someone would find of interest when I'm dead and gone and

100
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,380
She's quite clear. She says no, it gives a shit

101
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,340
It doesn't care about you. No care about me. There's a look. I'm now 59. She says

102
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,620
You know, it's like no one's ever asked for that shit. I never look at it

103
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,580
So I had a mission to find a number of things one is a VHS player

104
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,140
Desperately looking for one of those an NTSC VHS player or preferably a multi-standard

105
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,180
So I can digitize a couple of VHS tapes that I have

106
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,460
That are pretty funny and I want to put up online

107
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,980
That's actually the one thing I could not find and I wanted to find my stamp collection

108
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,900
My coin collection, which the coin collection passed down from my grandmother on my mom's side

109
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,020
I love that coin collection. It's not huge, but it's an American coin collection, which is nice

110
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:36,540
My watch collection, which we also dug up and then there were a number of pictures and a couple of things that I'd collected over the year

111
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,900
So really only one box of stuff that that I actually wanted and all the rest I mean there were boxes of wires

112
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,900
There were boxes of shit that

113
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,420
You know, wires and adapters that had no hardware

114
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:52,460
Connected to it anymore as far as I could tell you wind up with a lot of power adapters in your life

115
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,460
So all of that gone

116
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:01,980
Also there were just maybe 30 boxes of admin administration from previous companies and you're supposed to keep all that stuff for next

117
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,140
You know X amount of time. I think it's maybe seven years, but this has been about five years

118
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,140
and

119
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,140
As far as I'm concerned

120
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,020
All the lawsuits have come and gone everything's clean so everything's being shredded and

121
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:23,020
Disposed of and it felt good. It did take several hours. It was a lot of work a lot of Patricia stuff seem to stay stick around

122
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,660
Some furniture and we also do just you know giving furniture away give it to Oxfam

123
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,540
People don't buy a second hand furniture anymore

124
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,300
Even though there's some really good stuff that we essentially wind up giving away

125
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:43,020
And that's mainly because of places like well like Ikea where we went that afternoon

126
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,220
Incroyed in which is you know a good hours drive from Gilford

127
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,580
To pick up

128
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,460
What was it Patricia had me? Oh, I man. She's really good at this. She had this whole

129
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:59,580
Clositing system design. She knew exactly how she wanted it and so but that you know that of course took several hours

130
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,540
So that was Wednesday yesterday went into the city into the shortage studios

131
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,260
Pod show London

132
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:13,340
Recorded some more me VO today links which is pretty much the show that I'm now doing when you log on and be VO.com

133
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,300
It starts playing it's kind of a highlight of what it what's on the network that day and I sneak in a couple things there

134
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,860
From time to time see if you can catch him

135
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:29,340
Just just floating out some minor messages to to the yet to be converted charcoal heads

136
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,260
All right, so let's talk about some nut nutty shit that's going on

137
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,900
Across the globe a starting off in the United Kingdom

138
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,940
Which is there's some really funny stuff happening

139
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:47,500
Which is very clear how it works and what it's being done for the big thing that's a big news

140
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,300
Is now they're making the

141
00:09:50,700 --> 00:10:00,860
Making speeding even more expensive and penalizing you more in the United Kingdom drivers cod breaking the speed limit by more than 20 miles an hour could face a six point penalty

142
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Under new proposals

143
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:09,740
Which I think is pretty much after that you lose your license so you know for just speeding a little bit you could lose your license

144
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:17,100
And of course what the news won't tell you is that they're also going to be jacking out prices on

145
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:23,100
On these speed cameras and they're gonna be set tighter because really as far as I can tell

146
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,140
This is all about just bringing in more money into the coffers

147
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:36,220
And I wonder I guess in a way. It's it's kind of good if they if if they they being the government if they decide to

148
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,620
You know get more people off the road. What they say this is about is about

149
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,220
2,946 deaths they want to reduce that number

150
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,540
That's the annual death rate on British roads that that's the guys under which they're

151
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,980
implementing this where they haven't implemented yet, but I guess

152
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,020
I guess that's the consultation paper that's been doing the rounds

153
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:08,780
So if if you take people off the road then I guess in essence they still have to pay road taxes if they want to keep their car on the road

154
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:14,940
I don't know, I don't know, but it seems like this is one part of one big scheme to make more money and

155
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,140
The proof is in the pudding as we go down under to Australia

156
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,740
Red flex traffic systems

157
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:31,740
Has record profits amongst the economic woes G I wonder why it turns out that

158
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,500
Countries around the world the United States now getting into the game

159
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,500
Following these 6,000 cameras to monitor 60 million people in the United Kingdom

160
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,580
And it's on the rise these these things are money machines

161
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,420
That's it's it's literally right here in the numbers. Excuse me, well, I take a sip, yeah

162
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,740
Hmm

163
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:01,980
You know this does it actually slow you down on the road? Yeah, does it kill less people? Yeah, probably, but the main

164
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:10,140
The main driver behind this is money and so now everyone every government every council every

165
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,060
State all need money and this is one of the ways they're doing it

166
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,140
So

167
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,020
Just got to be more careful as you're out there driving don't exceed the speed limit. Yes, Lady Patricia

168
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:26,380
I'm looking at you. Hey, by the way down in down under in Australia. I love these guys, man

169
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,660
Here's a get another reason to go in north Queensland

170
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,580
An Australian holiday resort will hold a month long nude anything goes party

171
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,020
Aimed at combating the global credit crunch

172
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:47,500
I like this. Ah, you guys are crazy. Let's take in place in March nice

173
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,140
The white cockatoo resort in Mossman

174
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,940
And it's been inundated with inquiries. Yeah, no shit and anything goes resort for an entire month

175
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,140
Ah, March. I wonder if I could make it before in the march

176
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,980
That would be just fantastic. So that's what the Aussies are doing

177
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,180
Meanwhile here in in in the model land in the United Kingdom

178
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Another governmental move. Okay, it's okay to to buy sex from prostitutes

179
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:26,220
But it's not okay if that prostitute is a woman who is trafficked or is being pimped

180
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,740
by a drug dealer or otherwise and

181
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,260
ignorance will be no defense

182
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:40,380
So I really got to think about this so essentially you have to get an affidavit from your sex provider

183
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,940
Because that's really what they are

184
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,420
Yes, are the women who are being trafficked and put into sex slave trade absolutely

185
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,780
Man and then just like any other industry

186
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,340
That needs to be rooted out and authorities need to take action

187
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,620
but penalizing good customers of

188
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:04,220
businesses and be they you know single owner operator businesses

189
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,460
Or in in a unionized form like a brothel

190
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,660
He's good

191
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,460
You know I grew up in Amsterdam. I grew up in the Netherlands. It's no big deal now

192
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,020
I must say that it's

193
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,260
The combination of prostitution and drugs

194
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,220
Has been and always will be a problem

195
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,700
But it you know, but there's a lot of really good legitimate businesses out there providing services to people that

196
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,260
Quite frankly, I think drives down a lot of bullshit in the rest of society

197
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,540
Domestic abuse

198
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,340
People abuse verbally abuse people at work because they're sexually frustrated

199
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,420
In a country where the divorce rate is one of the highest in

200
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,580
Europe

201
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:57,500
Team pregnancy at an all-time high. I mean come on. This is why 1314 fifth-year-old your old boys

202
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,740
They need to go to a hooker

203
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,660
That's good for them. That's what we've all did. That's how we all grew up to be healthy boys and girls

204
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,100
Notice that they never never ever talk about women soliciting sex

205
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:17,100
Which you know just to be fair it should be persons who are trafficked and persons who

206
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:24,140
Buy sex from persons who provided, but of course, it's never like that. It's always that's always men

207
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,260
So hey, man

208
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,460
I don't know I got to talk to Patricia again because you know the way it's looking

209
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,980
Australia's looking like a better place. They speak English there too and at least they got these month long nude anything go

210
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,020

What can you do for me?

Eight.

272
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Almost one.

273
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
So Adam.

How did you do this week?

275
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,500
I at least got one star out of every set of three.

276
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Or the three sets.

277
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
So three out of possible six.

278
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
It does that.

279
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Me the other.

280
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
It's the place to find the answer.

281
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
I try not to start.

284

That's it.

307
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
That's what we do that under the auspices.

308
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
The hit test.

309
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,500
It's at least once a week.

310
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Sometimes it's none a week.

311
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
And then twice a week.

312
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Depending on how the show slipped.

313
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
I think you're much young.

314
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Great.

315
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
I love it for Friday.

316
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
Good songs, by the way.

317
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
I was talking about Australia earlier.

318
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:39,500
And got an email from.

319
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:48,500
And he's actually been trying to help me out with an Australian trip and getting in touch

320
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,500
with some folks who are into the alternative energy stuff down there.

321
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,500
And actually, for me, this email chain from John Christie at Lute Tech.

322
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Those are the guys that made these.

323
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,500
He's one of the inventors of the free electricity generator.

324
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,500
You know, the one where you hook it up to a small week powered battery.

325
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
You get that thing spinning.

326
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,500
And then all of a sudden it spits out, you know, killer watts or mega watts of power.

327
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
And these guys, they really must be onto something.

328
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,500
They really must be because he, he sends back after this beautiful,

329
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
the email that Phil sent him.

330
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
His John Christie emails back.

331
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Sorry, mate.

332
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,500
We're just too busy now to handle our current rate of interest without trying to get more.

333
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Thanks all the same.

334
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,500
They don't even want to talk.

335
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,500
I can understand a bit the whole world is falling over.

336
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
But all right.

337
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Well, how about an update, guys?

338
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
You know, free publicity, free promotion here.

339
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,500
Once you can sell something or whatever.

340
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
And there's some other interesting news.

341
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,500
A lot of this, by the way, of course, comes from the drop, the source code drop.io slash daily source code.

342
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:00,500
That's where you can, you can pretty much go there three times a day and get fresh news and enjoy it.

343
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Stuff that you, that isn't the mainstream and a lot of the articles that we point to.

344
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,500
And when I say we, it's the community of chuckleheads, you know who you are.

345
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Stuff that we point to and a lot of it is mainstream news.

346
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,500
It's just it doesn't really catch those big headlines.

347
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
So it never gets into the into the public mindset, if you will.

348
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,500
This is, this was actually kind of cool.

349
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,500
And of course, all these links can be found the daily source code.com.

350
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Just check under the episode for today 806 or crosspost that at curry.com.

351
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,500
A title of this article from new scientists.com.

352
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Plumbing the oceans could bring limitless clean energy.

353
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Very good read.

354
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
I'm not going to explain exactly how this works.

355
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:48,500
But essentially, by using different temperatures at different depths, you can create a renewable energy source.

356
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,500
As it says here, that has the potential to free many economies from their dependence on oil.

357
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
There's one thing I do know, we got a lot of ocean.

358
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,500
And a lot of water in the ocean, a lot of stuff we can do with that.

359
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,500
And I encourage you to take a look at this because the results are astounding.

360
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:11,500
It actually around, I think around 19, when was it here?

361
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,500
In the first flush of success, because this stuff does work.

362
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Just not, you know, completely experimental.

363
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,500
The US Department of Energy began planning a 40 megawatt test plant off of Hawaii.

364
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,500
In 1981, the funding for ocean thermal technologies began to dwindle and dried up all together.

365
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,500
And 95 when the price of oil began to drop eventually falling below $20 a barrel.

366
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,500
And this, of course, is part of the danger that we must be on the lookout for.

367
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:45,500
That we don't forget that we don't take the price of oil to be of any importance to our energy future.

368
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,500
It's finding cheap energy that anyone can essentially make.

369
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Did anyone can harness?

370
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,500
That's how we free ourselves from the shackles from the true owners of the globe.

371
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Forget about if we're going to save the earth with CO2 emissions dropping, et cetera.

372
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Forget about that.

373
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,500
What's really important is we need to be unshackled, unshackled from the energy elite.

374
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Well, that kind of sucked.

375
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
That was supposed to be.

376
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Hold on a second.

377
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Let me try that again.

378
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Unshackless.

379
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
I can't get the same emotion back.

380
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,500
Unshackless from the energy elite.

381
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,500
A comic strip.

382
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,500
A comic strip.

383
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
A comic strip.

384
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
A comic strip.

385
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
A comic strip.

386
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Sorry about that.

387
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
So yes, be commanding.

388
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Hello.

389
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Hello.

390
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Hello.

391
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Hello.

392
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Hello.

393
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Hello.

394
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:51,500
If you know not all people are slender like myself, some people are fifth peaks.

395
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
I guess he's calling himself a fat pig.

396
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:59,500
So they are afraid of getting naked, particularly in public and the good news.

397
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,500
But that's okay because now everyone's going to be naked.

398
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Just come on down to the 54.

399
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
Come on down to the white cockatoo.

400
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,500
What the hell was that?

401
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,500
I don't know.

402
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
That's where y'all can be naked, whether you're fat or not.

403
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,260
Hey, by the way, whenever you get a whole bunch of people together, I'm just a whole

404
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,500
lot of second comic strip blogger.

405
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,600
That's actually beautiful because you know that naked people, we've been trained

406
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,500
what naked people are supposed to look like.

407
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,540
First of all, naked guys, if you think women have been stigmatized and if you think

408
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:36,500
women have been portrayed a certain way in the media, try men.

409
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Guys naked generally, not a good look unless you're, you know, look just women.

410
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Most guys are not like Brad Pitt.

411
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
We're not like George Clooney.

412
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
We're not like Will Smith.

413
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Okay.

414
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,500
When we're naked, we're just not.

415
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,500
And conversely, guys, women aren't like Angelina Jolie or Aaron Burnett.

416
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Oh, man.

417
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Oh, Aaron.

418
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,500
Damn.

419
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,500
I love it when the market is crashing like yesterday.

420
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Oh, man.

421
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,500
That's when Aaron's at her sexiest.

422
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,300
Anyway, just enjoy each other for each other.

423
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,300
This external stuff.

424
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,300
That's got to stop.

425
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,500
I mean, that's destructive.

426
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Just in destroying our kids too.

427
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Anyway, I'm sorry, CSB.

428
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Fat thin, tall, skinny, whatever.

429
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Love y'all.

430
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,500
Love you too, CSB.

431
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:34,500
You, for this Fat Fat Fat is that new airport scanners that would show people naked,

432
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,500
immigration officers are not coming after all at all.

433
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
Oh.

434
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,500
Hold on a second.

435
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,500
So those, yeah, that's the new scanner they're implementing.

436
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,500
Where you can actually, it's like an x-ray.

437
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,500
And then you can see right through the person's clothes, see if they're concealing anything

438
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
underneath.

439
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,500
And the pictures I've seen, I don't know if they're real or not.

440
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,500
But it pretty much, you're looking at naked people.

441
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
And my case in point.

442
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,500
And with the pictures I saw, no George Clooney's.

443
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
No Brad Pitt's, no Angelina Jolie's.

444
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,500
And certainly, no Aaron Burnett's.

445
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,500
In other story, Poland has set to French proposal

446
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,500
about CO2 emissions trading scheme.

447
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,500
I quote,

448
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
What the hell does that mean?

449
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
In it.

450
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Pan Nintendo.

451
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
Yo.

452
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
What the hell does that mean CSB?

453
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
Vatére, Futra, La Cache.

454
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Ah, I wish I could understand French.

455
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Tére, Futra, La Cache.

456
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
Frégan, Schim.

457
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
I quote,

458
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Vatére, Futra, La Cache.

459
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Ah, sounds like.

460
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
In it.

461
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
In it.

462
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
In it.

463
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Pan Nintendo.

464
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Yo.

465
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Yeah.

466
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
Yeah.

467
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
Let's talk a little bit about that.

468
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,500
I definitely want to talk about digital money.

469
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Before I forget, a little promotion for a new drop site that popped up.

470
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,500
If you want to find out more about, I guess, hydrogen alternative energies.

471
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Drop.io slash.

472
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Hydrovolution.

473
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Hydrovolution.

474
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
Lots of YouTube videos.

475
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
Lots of interesting inventions.

476
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Link in the show knows the daily source code, of course.

477
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,500
And this thing that I found off of, like, oh, someone put this in.

478
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,500
No, I think I found this on a Boeing Boeing.

479
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
This kind of freaked me out.

480
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:41,500
Apparently Apple, the Apple video card and monitors are speaking some kind of digital rights management

481
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,500
protocol when they're talking in HD.

482
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,500
I'm reading the article here now.

483
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,500
And I think it was at the HDCP control.

484
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,500
What is that?

485
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,500
High definition copyright protection or some bullshit acronym like that.

486
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:10,500
But if you don't have an officially approved monitor or a non-compliant monitor, then the HD video just may not play.

487
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,500
And it's happened to a couple of people where this is actually some of their monitors.

488
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:21,500
And, you know, it's, I guess it's kind of like, remember when Microsoft came out with plug-in play and everything was supposed to work together.

489
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
And it was all about the drivers.

490
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,500
I guess that's kind of the problems we're going to run into now.

491
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,500
You can't just hook up any old display to your to your Mac.

492
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,500
But I just thought it was kind of kind of weird, you know, that it's come to this.

493
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Because now they're in, basically, would you call that a subsystem?

494
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,500
They're in the hardware bits of our computers now.

495
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,500
I mean, the Hollywood establishment.

496
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:57,500
And I bet you're going to make money off of the sale off of each of these HDCP controlled units, something like that.

497
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,500
In fact, the title of this is Apple to Mac owners throw away your monitor if Hollywood says so.

498
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
Yeah, that's pretty nasty.

499
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Okay.

500
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Some finance and economics.

501
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,500
Oh, man, I used to hate it when my teacher said that in school, and now I'm just loving it.

502
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,500
And the Fed.

503
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,500
This is kicking off tomorrow, Saturday.

504
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
It's in 39 cities.

505
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,500
You can find information about them at endofed.us.

506
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:29,500
The Federal Reserve, along with every other central bank, is truly at the root of all of our problems today.

507
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,500
In the United States, we have a constitution, which clearly lays out.

508
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
It is allowed to control the money.

509
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,500
And what money is, is even defined.

510
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Gold and silver coins, not paper, not fiat currency.

511
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:52,500
And our money is consistently being controlled by central bankers, the reserve banking system.

512
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:59,500
That's how they got themselves into this shit hole, which we are merrily just handing out the money.

513
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
Just handing it over to them.

514
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,500
They're gobbling it up and giving themselves bonuses and businesses usual.

515
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:11,500
So if we really want to get to the root of this problem, we've got to end the Fed.

516
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
At very least, we should audit them.

517
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,500
That would be a good start.

518
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
That's what Dr. Ron Paul is going for.

519
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,500
He's a little bit more moderate.

520
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,500
But I do see him on this website and the Fed.us.

521
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,500
If you can go to one of these rallies, I suggest you do.

522
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
It's a very strong statement.

523
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,500
And, you know, what momentum is building?

524
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,500
And this is a good step.

525
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,500
Because politicians are representatives who you also need to bring into this game.

526
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
They're not really very smart.

527
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,500
You know, not like they're dumb, but, you know, they're no more educated than you and I.

528
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,500
They don't really understand this banking system.

529
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:52,500
You know, there's, I heard Ron Paul talking about someone who's on the banking or the finance committee.

530
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,500
The other day, or, you know, a couple weeks ago, said to him,

531
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Well, it's not our money backed by gold.

532
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,500
You know, it doesn't even know that in 1971 or whatever it is.

533
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:08,500
In the 70s, the American moved off the gold standard, Bretton Woods busted.

534
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,500
There's nothing backing this money, which is why we just keep on printing it.

535
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:21,500
And it is a problem that's existed since 1913 when the Federal Reserve Act went into play.

536
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,500
And if you go back in history, it is one of the reasons we actually separated from the United States.

537
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,500
We separated from the United Kingdom in the first place.

538
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:35,500
Those of you around the world, please look at your own central banking system and come up with your own cool slogan and website.

539
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,500
And the ECB, as an example.

540
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,500
END, the ECB.EU.

541
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
All right, talk about that bailout.

542
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,500
Oh, man, this is a beautiful YouTube video, which I'm just going to play a little bit of.

543
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,500
This is James in in hope, I think you pronounce his name.

544
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
He is a senator.

545
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
And just I'm just going to play a little bit.

546
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,500
This is from C span.

547
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
It's a mainstream channel.

548
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,500
You can listen to this all day long if you want to.

549
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,500
And listen to how he wants to stop now, stop the bailout spending.

550
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,500
And he's actually introduced a bill to do that just that.

551
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,500
So if you support this, then you need to go and call your representative.

552
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,500
This is really what it takes because these people, they just need input.

553
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Eventually, if it's a thousand to one, like it was with the bailout in the first place.

554
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,500
And they brought down the phone systems and they jacked up the websites.

555
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,500
So you couldn't email anymore.

556
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,500
They would be the people who wanted the bill to go through at all cost.

557
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:49,500
Threatening, using threatening tones to senators when they were mulling over weather to vote for this package or not.

558
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:56,500
Hey here, let the senator speak from self here.

559
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
Hold on a second.

560
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,500
You're not hearing that, are you?

561
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
I'm sorry.

562
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
I mean, you know what I did?

563
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,500
I forgot to start up in a central part.

564
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Oh man, well, I have to re hijack this whole thing off.

565
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Okay, hold on a second.

566
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,500
I'm going to go through the motions here.

567
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Whenever I want to bring something in from the web browser, then essentially, I won't keep trying.

568
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Essentially, the way I do it is I use audio hijack pro, but if you don't have the instant hijacking in place or whatever that's called,

569
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,500
then your browser has to quit and restart to get, why am I telling you this?

570
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
I'm just trying to delay.

571
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,500
I'm just trying to delay until it starts up again.

572
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,500
Okay, here comes the senator about the bailout.

573
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Mr. President, given the recent news about Secretary Paulson's execution of the tarp program,

574
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,500
I'm firmly believe action is required by Congress.

575
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:04,500
This morning, I introduced S3683 as legislation that would do two things.

576
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:12,500
Mr. President, it would freeze any of the amount of money of the first $350 billion that has not already been expended.

577
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:23,500
And secondly, it would change the process by which we would access or Secretary Paulson would access the second $300 and in $50 billion.

578
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,500
Well, so that's the basic.

579
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,500
First came to this.

580
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,500
That's basically what he's what he's up there for.

581
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
A conference call.

582
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Listen to this.

583
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
On that conference call, it was September the 19th.

584
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Listen to this.

585
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:43,500
President, he's going to talk about how Paulson freaked our representatives out into signing this bill.

586
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Listen to it.

587
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
That time he was talking about the crisis that is upon us now.

588
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
We have to do something.

589
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
We have to do something big.

590
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
It's got to be $700 billion.

591
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,500
It has to be done right now.

592
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,500
The only way to do it is to buy troubled assets.

593
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
At that time, I asked some questions.

594
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,500
One question was, well, if there are assets, they're going to be bought.

595
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:08,500
What is the criteria that will be used to determine which assets should be bought?

596
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
And there was not an answer to that question.

597
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,500
First not.

598
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:19,500
Second question was, which institutions that are holding these assets would be the ones who would be eligible for this for this buyout?

599
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Well, I'm not going to tell you.

600
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
There were no answers to that either.

601
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Of course not.

602
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,500
Well, that's not a priority.

603
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
They don't actually have to tell you.

604
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,500
That's in the Federal Reserve Act.

605
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,500
The Bolsheet from 1930, how much longer do we have to live with this?

606
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
We're almost at 100 years.

607
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Stop the insanity.

608
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,500
And as the next few days went by, we had several conversations.

609
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:46,500
I didn't have any personal conversations with them except in one conference lunch.

610
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,500
And that is, is this the only way to do it?

611
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,500
Yes, it's going to have to be buying out troubled assets.

612
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:58,500
And they still, the answers were not there to those questions.

613
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,500
Now, in my statement opposing, I voted against the policy plan last month.

614
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
In my station opposing it.

615
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,500
I laid out three primary reasons why I voted.

616
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,500
All right.

617
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,500
So that's more homework.

618
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,500
You'll find the link in the show notes at dailysourceco.com.

619
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:19,500
And if you live in Oklahoma, call up Senator James in hope and tell him he did a good job.

620
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,500
Congratulations.

621
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,500
You got to give some good too.

622
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,500
And anyone else who gives a shit?

623
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Yeah, you can contact your Senator, your representative.

624
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,500
Send him this YouTube clip because they don't know what's going on in the Senate.

625
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
All the time, not everyone's there.

626
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,500
For sure.

627
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Because we can make this change.

628
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,500
I guarantee you.

629
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
Meanwhile, in the mainstream media,

630
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,500
a CNBC Peter Schiff, who we've talked about and played stuff from on the show before.

631
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
And he is really killing over there on CNBC.

632
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
And they just, they can't stand what he's saying.

633
00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:01,500
He's essentially saying the same things that we're discussing here on the Charlie that you read and

634
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:07,500
Oh, the stuff you read on the source code drop.

635
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
And stuff that Dr. Ron Paul says.

636
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,500
And these guys, they really get offended by it.

637
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,500
In fact, I'm not quite sure this is some one of these panels.

638
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Panel shows is probably on the evening.

639
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,500
One guy says, and what did you think of the play, Mr. Lincoln?

640
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,500
You know, like you doomsday say, well, the guy has been right.

641
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,500
His name is Peter Schiff.

642
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,500
He predicted this.

643
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,500
This collapse in 2007.

644
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
Markets collapsed right back in 2006.

645
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,500
I've been making the rounds out there in cyberspace.

646
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Turned out he was right on the money.

647
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,500
Here he was on CNBC.

648
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Way back in February of 2007.

649
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,500
Aren't you looking at the glut of houses on the market for sale with no buyers in the

650
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,500
collapse into subprime market for on the verge of a major major recession.

651
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,500
It's probably going to start by the end of this year.

652
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,500
Maybe early next year.

653
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
The housing market is just beginning to unravel.

654
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,500
We're seeing the tip of the iceberg here.

655
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,500
And that clip was from before the initial signs of the subprime crisis in the summer

656
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,500
of 07 and the record highs above October of 07 leadership.

657
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
It's a present of Euro Pacific Capitol.

658
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
He is the author of the way.

659
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,500
I'm not quite sure who this presenter is.

660
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,500
This Asian woman.

661
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
Stop shouting, bitch.

662
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,500
You're irritating.

663
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Little book of bull moves in bear markets.

664
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
He is here tonight in a fast money day view.

665
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
Peter, great to have you with us.

666
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Thanks for having here.

667
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,500
What do you make of what we saw today is this sort of the capitulation that we've been waiting

668
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,500
for in this market.

669
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,500
The capitulation is probably the most over-realized word on CNBC.

670
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,500
I've heard every day for months.

671
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,500
I think capitulation if we get it is years away.

672
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,500
So don't be looking for it.

673
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
What is the worst case scenario for our markets?

674
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,500
Our markets are going lower.

675
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
This is not just a financial crisis.

676
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
This is an economic collapse.

677
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Our entire phony economy is collapsing around us.

678
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
This guy is going home.

679
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
He's just stopped, but they should get away.

680
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,500
And we let it happen.

681
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,500
So other than that, I'm still like it.

682
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,500
I just feel like the play.

683
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
Look, you have to understand.

684
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,500
That look for the past.

685
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500
It's amazing.

686
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
These guys that like, they do not want to believe it.

687
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,500
I guess they just don't understand how anything works.

688
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,500
If you watch this entire clip, it's about six minutes.

689
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
I'm not going to play the whole thing here for you here.

690
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,500
It's just funny.

691
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,500
And Peter Schiff is just boom, boom, boom, boom.

692
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,500
He's throwing them out one after another.

693
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,500
And the guys that acting like he's like he's some genius.

694
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,500
He's just saying, look, it's simple, simple economics.

695
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:33,500
This is yesterday when the Dow dropped 444 points to 7552.

696
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:41,500
I have a bet riding that it'll hit 7286 before Valentine's Day.

697
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,500
I'm going to have Ron as my partner, Ron Bloom.

698
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
He's like, no, this is great.

699
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,500
I was going to rebound.

700
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,500
I'm like, no, man, this thing's going down.

701
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,500
The dollar's going down.

702
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,500
Of course, right now, the dollar's looking fantastic against the euro.

703
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,500
And the, and the, and the euro to pound ratios.

704
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,500
Like, one 18 now, I mean, this is unprecedented.

705
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:08,500
So I think that Peter Schiff, you know, and he's just, he's not a magician.

706
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
He's just looking at the evidence.

707
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
And he's saying it's going to drop even further.

708
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,500
And I have to say, unfortunately, I think he's right.

709
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Of course, there are many of us who believe that this is all pretty much orchestrated

710
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
and said into motion.

711
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Well, you hear there is the nice little, little blips from MasterCard.com.

712
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,500
This link dropped on the site on the source code drop as well.

713
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,500
Our new money, which, of course, will not be at all paper or

714
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,500
course, certainly far from coin.

715
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,500
It'll be digital.

716
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,500
And MasterCard is coming out with a pay pass.

717
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
You can go.

718
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,500
I guess it's already implemented now in, uh,

719
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,500
select locations around the United Kingdom.

720
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,500
You just tap, tap and go trademark.

721
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,500
To pay with MasterCard pay pass, you simply tap and go.

722
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,500
MasterCard pay pass will change the way you pay for items under 10 pounds forever.

723
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,500
No waiting, no queueing and no fumbling for change.

724
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Just tap and go.

725
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,500
I got the little tapping goes on.

726
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Where is it?

727
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,500
I want to hear that again.

728
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
Yeah, playing tap and go.

729
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,500
Let's hear the sound.

730
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
You've been assimilated.

731
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,500
One more time, please.

732
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,500
Yes.

733
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
We have you on record.

734
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,500
Thank you.

735
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,500
You have used four credits.

736
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,500
You know, you know, my take on that, right?

737
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,500
About carbon credits becoming money.

738
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Now, this is not a news article.

739
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,500
This is from Atos Origin.

740
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,500
And they're huge IT consultancy firm.

741
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,500
And this is a press release from then.

742
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:51,500
Ground breaking trial proves carbon emissions can be managed like money.

743
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,500
Gee, really.

744
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,500
Atos Origin, an international IT services company today,

745
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:05,500
deals that feedback from the first ever trial to enable real-time calculation of personal carbon emissions.

746
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:12,500
Demonstrates a willingness and readiness to measure such emissions.

747
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:18,500
Ah, the pilot initiated by the RSA and using, who's the RSA?

748
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,500
Say, no, this is stuff you got to go on and check RSA.

749
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:27,500
Doesn't even say with the RSA, the Royal Something Association?

750
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,500
A built using Atos Origin technology, bullshit, Microsoft,

751
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:37,500
focused on measuring the carbon emissions from individual use of road fuel.

752
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,500
The trial highlighted key conclusions.

753
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,500
Let me just see.

754
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,500
So they're saying that, here we go.

755
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,500
The pilot, they're already in the pilot stages here.

756
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,500
The pilot tested five options for capturing personal carbon emissions.

757
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
And this is, we're going to get down to carbon credits.

758
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
That's the money we're going to be using.

759
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
All you need to do is just phase out the money part.

760
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:10,500
Carbon Carter proposed national card to be issued to all citizens to provide consistent capture and reporting across the UK.

761
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:20,500
This would be likely to require significant new infrastructure of money across all parts of the fuel purchase of transaction process.

762
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Now, this gets better.

763
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:34,500
And debit cards and pre-pay financial cards provides large-scale current coverage.

764
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,500
It looks like I got to find out who RSA is.

765
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,500
I need to do some more research myself.

766
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,500
Find out who these guys are and why they wanted this pilot initiated.

767
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,500
I'll bet she has royal something.

768
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,500
Anyway, what we're talking about carbon credits being used as money,

769
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,500
we have something much better.

770
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:58,500
We have credits in the form of reduction on all kinds of awesome products from...

771
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,500
Oh, man, what do we have?

772
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,500
Budget rent a car.

773
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,500
We've got eHarmony now.

774
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,500
What you need to do is go to www.meviooffers.com.

775
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,500
That's where you can find all the best prices on some excellent services.

776
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,500
Can't get a better price online at any time just use my code,

777
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,500
or, you know, which you can find in the show notes at datasourcecode.com,

778
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,500
or use any other person's code.

779
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,500
Because I don't get the money anyway.

780
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,500
If I was getting paid for the shit, then I would actually be begging you.

781
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:34,500
And of course, our old favorite, we currently do about 50,000 transactions a month for these guys.

782
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,500
What a great partner.

783
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:40,500
They are fantastic as a sponsorship and advertising.

784
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:46,500
And really helping support or doing a building up a new alternative media industry, GoDaddy.

785
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,500
Hi Adam, it's Brennick, this reality podcast.

786
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,500
Just drop in your quick line to say, thanks very much for your GoDaddy discount codes.

787
00:44:54,500 --> 00:45:00,500
I've just dropped a huge amount of money on GoDaddy for services and used your discount code.

788
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,500
And it's brought things down very nicely.

789
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,500
So, you know, supporting you, supporting them, loving you.

790
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,500
And, uh, trying to keep it real.

791
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,500
Take care.

792
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,500
Alright, Brennick.

793
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,500
Thank you very much, my friend.

794
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,500
It's highly appreciated.

795
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,500
I've been talking in my hands lately when I'm waking up.

796
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
Well, my tongue is tight.

797
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:32,500
I've been thinking I should leave instead of waiting for the time is right.

798
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,500
I've backed the bags under my eyes.

799
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,500
Well, I've seen enough to know what it's like.

800
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Just turning me upside down.

801
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,500
Tell me what I've done wrong now.

802
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,500
All I can do is try it.

803
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,500
When everything's written, me down.

804
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,500
Looking at the inside out.

805
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,500
Well, my rules got changed somehow.

806
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,500
Maybe it's suicide.

807
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,500
To stay here and just stick around.

808
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:19,500
I was able to hide every bruise on my body till now.

809
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,500
Till now.

810
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,500
I've been walking in my hands lately when I'm waking up.

811
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,500
Well, my legs are tight.

812
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:51,500
I've been thinking I should leave for the window of it's a marathon.

813
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,500
I've been dreaming I could fly it.

814
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,500
Well, I'm free enough, but I'm still waiting.

815
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,500
Turning me upside down.

816
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,500
Tell me what I've done wrong now.

817
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,500
All I can do is try it.

818
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,500
When everything's written, me down.

819
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,500
Looking at the inside out.

820
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,500
Well, my rules got changed somehow.

821
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,500
Maybe it's suicide.

822
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,500
To stay here and just stick around.

823
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:37,500
I was able to hide every bruise on my body till now.

824
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,500
Till now.

825
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:46,500
I've been afraid to just walk out.

826
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,500
And I know where to stop me now.

827
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:08,500
It's turning me upside down.

828
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,500
Tell me what I've done wrong now.

829
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,500
All I can do is try it.

830
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,500
When everything's written, me down.

831
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,500
Looking at the inside out.

832
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,500
Well, my man, I'm making a lot of emails from the blatantly.

833
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,500
So I've been doing the careers doing well.

834
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,500
But gentry and old friend of the church.

835
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,500
Just stick around the church.

836
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,500
I was able to hide every bruise on my body till now.

837
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,500
Charlie hands.

838
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,500
Oh, till now.

839
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,500
Tell me what I've done wrong now.

840
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,500
When everything's written, me down.

841
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,500
Tell me what I've done wrong now.

842
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,500
I've been afraid to just walk out.

843
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,500
I've been afraid to just walk out.

844
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
That's the guy who should be on American idols.

845
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,500
I was able to hide every bruise on my body till now.

846
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,500
You would kick so much ice.

847
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,500
Oh, till now.

848
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,500
Bob Gentry upside down.

849
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:01,500
Daily source code episode 806.

850
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:07,500
Taking you into the weekend with a footballer Friday festivities.

851
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,500
Yeah.

852
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:15,500
Oh, the beautiful song that is.

853
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:21,500
The bailouts are just laughable at this point.

854
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,500
I hope you've been following along with some of the C.

855
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,500
Span coverage more of these hearings, which is just funny.

856
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,500
And now, of course, I love the way.

857
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,500
This is this is now taking place in all industries all over the world,

858
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,500
except the one that really counts, which is banking,

859
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,500
in particular central banking and financial policy.

860
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,500
So as a citizenry, it doesn't matter if you're in the United Kingdom,

861
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,500
or if you're in the United States and the UK here.

862
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,500
You know, it's like, hey, we're going to get these bastards who are making way too much money.

863
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,500
Who the fuck do they think they are?

864
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,500
And so they grab a TV host, Jonathan Ross.

865
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,500
Well, by the way, it doesn't make too much money for his talent.

866
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,500
But, uh, or for the marketplace, let me put it that way.

867
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,500
But that's what's happening.

868
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,500
Now in the US, so the automakers, they say,

869
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,500
oh, and we're going to die if we don't get to any cash,

870
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:15,500
because our cash burn is about to five billion a month.

871
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,500
And so that means even though they've got money coming in,

872
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
they're still burning five billion a month.

873
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:26,500
So that seems like there's some deficit there in there in their business plan.

874
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,500
So they want to be bailed out.

875
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,500
And what do they do?

876
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,500
Schmuck's.

877
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,500
They all take their private corporate jets down to Washington.

878
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,500
And these, I looked at some of the pictures.

879
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,500
These are serious.

880
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,500
This is a serious hardware.

881
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,500
And these are $40,50 million jets.

882
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,500
You know, at a cost of, I don't know, maybe eight grand an hour.

883
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,500
Got to spark one of these babies up.

884
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:54,500
I mean, I know venture capitalists have their own airplanes,

885
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,500
and they've gone over to China to get investment for their funds.

886
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,500
And they're talking to the sovereign wealth fund.

887
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,500
So, you know, like the Chinese state,

888
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,500
and they fly commercial, they're not stupid.

889
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:12,500
You know, guys, you know, oh, man, how dumb can you be?

890
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,500
But of course, that's being attacked immediately.

891
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,500
I think there is, there is some kind of in-between way that, you know,

892
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:25,500
these guys would scale down, so they at least could afford the pension plans for their workers.

893
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,500
And then let new industry come in.

894
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:33,500
Let new companies hire workers who are already pre-skilled at, you know,

895
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:37,500
sure there's some things you won't, some positions that won't be needed as we move to

896
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:43,500
electric or other forms of non-combustion base transportation.

897
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,500
But it's what has to happen.

898
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,500
You know, someone is going to get hurt somewhere.

899
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,500
And people will go in and out of jobs.

900
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,500
But as long as we're building towards something new,

901
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,500
there's going to be jobs.

902
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,500
That's just my humble opinion.

903
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,500
And of course, the auto industry isn't really about cars.

904
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,500
It's really about the finance.

905
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,500
These, these, these auto makers.

906
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:13,500
So you have GMC of GMAC, which is the, the finance arm of General Motors Corporation.

907
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:20,500
It's a separate company, but essentially GMAC LLC is the largest lender to GM.

908
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,500
And so they've now done what American expressed it, you know,

909
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,500
another credit-based company said, oh, we'll just turn into a bank.

910
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,500
So that we can take some of that bank money.

911
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:35,500
So they're already looking at getting a 38 billion.

912
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:40,500
In loans or however else that works with, with Paulson and, and Koshkari is

913
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,500
little butt boy there who does all this dirty work.

914
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,500
Adam, Eric from Portland.

915
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Yo, I was trying to think of a reason why Henry Paulson would put

916
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,500
Neil Koshkari in charge of the bailout.

917
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,500
Okay.

918
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:59,500
And then I thought about Uncle Hank and his group as gangsters involved in organized crime.

919
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,500
Yeah, you think?

920
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,500
Then it hit me.

921
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:06,500
Koshkari is being put forward as an economic hitman and a fall guy.

922
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,500
There you go.

923
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,500
He is young.

924
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:13,500
And he can go to prison for a few years and come out as a made man.

925
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:19,500
When the prosecution start, Koshkari will take the fall protecting the real criminals,

926
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,500
and Bernaki, Cox, and others.

927
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,500
Koshkari will do a few years in a minimum security prison and he'll come back

928
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,500
a made man for the rest of his life.

929
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,500
Yeah, he'll be king now.

930
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:35,500
I would like to end this thought by saying, this is completely conjecture

931
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,500
and injuendo.

932
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,500
But if you put the processes known to be evolved involved in organized crime

933
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:47,500
and overlay them on the current bailout system, you have a clear

934
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,500
match.

935
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,500
Big hair.

936
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,500
Hope you win.

937
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,500
Riddle.

938
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,500
And fighting for your freedom.

939
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.

940
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Thank you very much.

941
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,500
Well, those guys are given our money away in our economy collapses.

942
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,500
They're all having fun.

943
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,500
Giving themselves millions of dollars.

944
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,500
And you.

945
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,500
You might have to put your house up for sale.

946
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:24,500
The sun went up, we're reading more than just a couple of hours of the dawn.

947
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:29,500
Mrs. Hadley picked out through a curtains,

948
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:35,500
only what was going on.

949
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,500
When they were sad, over coffee cups,

950
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:44,500
the night she got full of sleep in her.

951
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:49,500
In the living room, the living memories,

952
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:55,500
still they're said to go.

953
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,500
And they're all the same, once more.

954
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:07,500
We're in spring to see my roses grow.

955
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,500
And all the things you try to fix,

956
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:15,500
the luxellies, the gossip sticks,

957
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,500
as for sale.

958
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:27,500
You're getting on the side, as for sale.

959
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,500
It was yours and it was mine,

960
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,500
and tomorrow, some strangers,

961
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,500
would apply me now, the stairs,

962
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:46,500
to the bedroom, fill the memories of the wall.

963
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:51,500
We used to share.

964
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:59,500
I know you always love the band.

965
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:05,500
From the time it shall be sped.

966
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,500
Remember how we found it,

967
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,500
where we died soon,

968
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:17,500
from that southern summer day.

969
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:21,500
But the things I keep to celebrate,

970
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,500
my money gave her,

971
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,500
I know as in day,

972
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,500
as for sale.

973
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:37,500
You're getting on the side, as for sale.

974
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,500
It was yours and it was mine,

975
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,500
and tomorrow, some strangers,

976
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:50,500
would apply me now, the stairs,

977
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:56,500
to the bedroom, fill the memories of the wall.

978
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,500
We used to share.

979
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,500
I know as for sale.

980
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:08,500
You're getting on the side, as for sale.

981
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,500
It was yours and it was mine,

982
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,500
and tomorrow, some strangers,

983
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,500
would apply me now, the stairs,

984
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:26,500
to the bedroom, fill the memories of the wall.

985
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,500
We used to share.

986
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,500
I know as for sale.

987
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:36,500
You're getting on the side, as for sale.

988
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,500
This was big in the 70s.

989
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,500
It was just a wee lad in 71, 72,

990
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,500
or 73, or 74.

991
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:52,500
Lucifer, and house for sale, Dutch band.

992
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:56,500
You might have been able to tell by the pronunciation of the accent.

993
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:00,500
We used to share.

994
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,500
Funny thing is, I know most of the band members

995
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,500
by now been known for a long time.

996
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,500
The drummer, Henny Heismund,

997
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,500
who went on to the presenter,

998
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:18,500
a host of many television shows.

999
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,500
This was what I hit this was, man,

1000
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,500
back in Holland, in the day.

1001
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,500
Oh, man.

1002
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,500
That would just be blasting out of speakers,

1003
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:30,500
because you gotta play that one loud, you know what I'm saying?

1004
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:34,500
So, while all this crap is going down,

1005
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,500
and we're not holding our politicians to the task,

1006
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,500
there are some definite, I hate to say it,

1007
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,500
but points of light.

1008
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,500
You'll love this story.

1009
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,500
Apparently having learned nothing from Nevada,

1010
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,500
I guess it happened in Nevada as well.

1011
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,500
I'm a little behind.

1012
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,500
Arizona's fourth legislative district,

1013
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,500
GOP meeting,

1014
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,500
was abruptly halted Monday night.

1015
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,500
When Chairman Bob Burgess realized he did not have the votes

1016
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,500
to elect his delegates to the county convention,

1017
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,500
or reelect his friends to leadership positions.

1018
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,500
The reason a large group of constitutional Republican reformers,

1019
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,500
including many, of course, Ron Paul supporters,

1020
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,500
showed up and established a clear majority.

1021
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,500
So then what does the guy do?

1022
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,500
Or the chair, I guess, I don't know if he was the chair or not.

1023
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,500
It was flustered upon realizing his predicament,

1024
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,500
gavled the meeting to a close without electing delegates at all,

1025
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,500
ordered the sheriff's department to clear the hall,

1026
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:34,500
and had the light shut off.

1027
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,500
And here comes the true patriotic part of the story.

1028
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,500
The reformers quickly gathered in the parking lot,

1029
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,500
determined to finish the meeting.

1030
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,500
When Chairman Burgess had the exterior lights cut as well,

1031
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,500
the group found a janitor and had them turn back on.

1032
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,500
And here it comes, they established a quorum,

1033
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:56,500
which means there were enough people to hold a vote,

1034
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,500
and they elected a slate of delegates and new leadership.

1035
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:04,500
I love this. This is the type of revolution we can actually make happen.

1036
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:08,500
And I'd love to hear from someone who was a part of that,

1037
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,500
and how they went down if there's some kind of blueprint.

1038
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,500
I'm sure it sounds like it was planned.

1039
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,500
They knew what was going to happen.

1040
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,500
I love it.

1041
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,500
Some more homework for y'all.

1042
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,500
There's a video.

1043
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,500
I've put the link in the show notes of Ram Immanuel.

1044
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,500
This is the chief of staff of our present electobama.

1045
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,500
Just so you can kind of get to know the guy a little bit better.

1046
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,500
It's very interesting to hear him talk,

1047
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,500
because we have not really heard him speak publicly,

1048
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,500
at least I haven't seen it anywhere.

1049
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,500
And this is kind of in a free forum with the press,

1050
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,500
who he's very chummy with, I might add.

1051
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:47,500
Now he's a politician. He's run for multiple offices.

1052
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:53,500
And he will be running a lot of the big show come January.

1053
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,500
So just something you might want to take a look at, just to,

1054
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:02,500
you know, just to kind of get a little preview of what your government

1055
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,500
is going to be like.

1056
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,500
That's not even getting to you.

1057
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:12,500
This is something that was dropped on Danny source code.

1058
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,500
Drop.

1059
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,500
Thought I always find Danny source code.

1060
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,500
I like it though. My team, oh man, nothing for nothing.

1061
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,500
Chuck 806.

1062
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,500
All the decisions from our...

1063
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,500
daily lives.

1064
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,500
Ten to a new system.

1065
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:35,500
May everything seems so black or white.

1066
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,500
I wish that you mad nature.

1067
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:45,500
Soldiers fighting in our holy land.

1068
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,500
It's not pretty big shit.

1069
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,500
You'll go fight these days.

1070
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,500
And he's right.

1071
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,500
That's life.

1072
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,500
A little mirror.

1073
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,500
Send out the mountain.

1074
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,500
As I'm the way it's supposed to be.

1075
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,500
None of the mountain.

1076
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:14,500
You'll just give me a little hold of me.

1077
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,500
And I'll be.

1078
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,500
All the layers seem to be.

1079
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,500
I guess we need a little extra sunscreen.

1080
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,500
All day never ever.

1081
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,500
It's me.

1082
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,500
Thanks God for the gift.

1083
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,500
And man.

1084
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,500
Send out the mountain.

1085
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,500
So not the way it's supposed to be.

1086
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,500
None of the mountain.

1087
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,500
You'll just give me a little hold of me.

1088
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,500
And I'll be.

1089
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,500
Don't you be away.

1090
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,500
I'll do.

1091
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,500
There's a change in the weather.

1092
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,500
And you see my whole world of you.

1093
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,500
Without love, all the emotion.

1094
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:24,500
You might as well kiss your life right off the floor.

1095
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:58,500
While the steward tries to ease our pain

1096
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,500
I lose people a little reassure me

1097
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:09,500
Late night hosts just seem to say the same

1098
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:13,500
It's just a matter of TV rades

1099
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:17,500
Look at the mountain

1100
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,500
There's not the way through the steward

1101
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,500
Look at the mountain

1102
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,500
Just give me a lift

1103
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,500
All that means

1104
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,500
Oh, give me a lift

1105
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,500
All that means

1106
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,500
Yeah, give me a lift

1107
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,500
All that means

1108
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,500
All that means

1109
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,500
All that means

1110
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,500
Yeah, I might see you all bad, nothing for nothing

1111
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:49,500
Nice

1112
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:57,500
Oh, yeah, that makes me feel ready for the weekend

1113
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,500
Do some more work tomorrow

1114
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:04,500
Setting up a green screen in the office here

1115
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,500
Got this new license.new

1116
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,500
I've seen it before this program called VideoQ

1117
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:13,500
Got some concepts I want to mess around with

1118
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,500
Maybe I'll use this prototyping

1119
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,500
Who knows it might even turn out to be something

1120
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,500
I can use online and full on production

1121
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:22,500
And I'm going to go look for a VHS player

1122
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,500
Because I really got some tapes that I want to digitize and put up

1123
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,500
Because you're going to laugh your ass off when you see it

1124
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:31,500
Two more articles that didn't really fit anywhere else

1125
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,500
That I did just want to mention today

1126
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,500
One from the United Kingdom

1127
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,500
From the mail

1128
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,500
Here's the headline fury over 100 million pound plan

1129
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:44,500
For hundreds of gypsy sites across the country

1130
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,500
And I was reading this

1131
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,500
And essentially there's a little map

1132
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,500
And the map is titled where the camps will go

1133
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,500
And the showing all these different parts

1134
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:58,500
North East, Yorkshire, East Midlands, the East London, Southwest

1135
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:02,500
And how many people will be able to stay there

1136
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,500
Essentially these are nomadic people

1137
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:09,500
Who have trailers

1138
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:13,500
Mobile trailers, mobile homes, caravans, I guess you could say

1139
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,500
And I was looking at this and I'm like, wow man

1140
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:21,500
Knowing that the Lisbon Treaty said, look, if you're homeless

1141
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:25,500
And mental ill or you're addicted to alcohol or drugs

1142
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,500
We can incarcerate, yeah, I'm looking at these

1143
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:30,500
And I'm thinking, yeah, you can think it's like a camping ground camp

1144
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,500
But it could also just be a camp

1145
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,500
I don't know, something going on there

1146
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,500
To say the least

1147
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,500
And this one just really drove home

1148
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,500
How stupid we are to let our

1149
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,500
Governmental representatives set this shit up

1150
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,500
Where this is actually coming from

1151
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,500
Devorac.org slash blogs where I found it

1152
01:06:55,500 --> 01:07:00,500
Blackwater gunboats and private navy will now protect ships from pirates

1153
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:05,500
So, you know, I've talked about this so many times

1154
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,500
The forces in Iraq

1155
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:12,500
Yes, there's a large number are enlisted men, women

1156
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:17,500
But there's a lot of these commercial companies who are going to be commercial

1157
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:22,500
Police forces and other types of enforcement units

1158
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:26,500
And let's see what they have

1159
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:30,500
They've got their own ship, it's called the MacArthur

1160
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:34,500
It will carry up to 40 armed guards and has a landing pad

1161
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,500
For an attack helicopter, which I presume they also have

1162
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,500
Should we be paying for this?

1163
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,500
And I'm definitely going to bring up the in the conversation

1164
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,500
I think we're doing no agenda tomorrow

1165
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:47,500
John is in Portugal, so we're doing tomorrow morning early

1166
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,500
For some reason the old man is to get up early

1167
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,500
I guess like eight o'clock or eight thirty crap

1168
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,500
It's my free Saturday

1169
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,500
I'm definitely going to bring this up and say

1170
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,500
What is the deal with these pirates?

1171
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,500
What are they after?

1172
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,500
And what exactly is the point, I guess

1173
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:10,500
You know, I guess you can't bomb them to high hell

1174
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,500
Because that would cause an ecological disaster

1175
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,500
But do they really expect to get away with this

1176
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,500
Or is this a political statement?

1177
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,500
It certainly warns more investigation

1178
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,500
That's for sure

1179
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:25,500
So those are things that you probably won't see on the fox

1180
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:29,500
Or CNN or CNBC and certainly not on your mainstream nightly news

1181
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,500
But at least you're in tune

1182
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:37,500
And you can always follow the latest headlines at drop.io slash daily source code

1183
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,500
But it ain't all bad, my friends, chuckle heads

1184
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,500
Because no matter what you think, no matter what it reads

1185
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,500
It can't brain every day

1186
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,500
This little one tries as hard as she can

1187
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,500
Do anything just so she can fit in

1188
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:55,500
She wants a friend so bad she'll do whatever they tell her

1189
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,500
To make this small she would miss behind

1190
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:01,500
But all the while they would laugh for the face

1191
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:05,500
She begins to cry because she thought that they liked her

1192
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:10,500
Even though you feel all alone

1193
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,500
It can't rain every day

1194
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,500
It don't rain forever

1195
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:19,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1196
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,500
I know it can't rain every day

1197
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:26,500
It don't rain forever

1198
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1199
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1200
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1201
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1202
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1203
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1204
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1205
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1206
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1207
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1208
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:45,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1209
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1210
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1211
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1212
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1213
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:51,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1214
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1215
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1216
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1217
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1218
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1219
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1220
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1221
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1222
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1223
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1224
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1225
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:06,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1226
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1227
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1228
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1229
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1230
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1231
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1232
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1233
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1234
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1235
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1236
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1237
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1238
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,500
Your sunshine may be gone

1239
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:54,500
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I

1240
01:10:54,500 --> 01:11:09,220
know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know to see it.

1241
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:20,220
The young ladies been lost for a while

1242
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:23,220
But that's okay now she's having a child

1243
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:28,220
She found a guy who she wants, she's got someone who loves her

1244
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,220
But this morning she woke up in pain

1245
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:33,220
Nobody had to tell her because she knew right away

1246
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:37,220
So she started to cry because she won't be a mother

1247
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:42,220
Even though you feel alone

1248
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:45,220
The car rain every day

1249
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:48,220
The rain forever

1250
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,220
The sunshine may be gone

1251
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:55,220
But I know the car rain every day

1252
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:58,220
The car rain forever

1253
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:05,220
Has a little bit of a chilly pepper's vibe

1254
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,220
Do it, I'm not quite sure what that is

1255
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:11,220
Like a KOD best name for a band

1256
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:13,220
Playable on death

1257
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:15,220
I like that

1258
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:17,220
Thank you

1259
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:22,220
Definitely words to live by

1260
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:25,220
You can't rain forever

1261
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:29,220
You're willing

1262
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:32,220
I don't care we can say about climate change

1263
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:38,220
And that wraps up episode 806

1264
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:42,220
Coming to you from the Curry Matter

1265
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:46,220
One of the last few shows that will be emanating from this location

1266
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:50,220
As we get into the weekend and already another month over

1267
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:53,220
We're getting close to December, holy moly

1268
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,220
Time is going very very fast

1269
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:59,220
It's like it's speeding up just a little bit

1270
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,220
You know what I mean?

1271
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:01,220
So you've got your freedom

1272
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:03,220
Please enjoy it this weekend

1273
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:05,220
Do something with it, do something with your wife

1274
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:08,220
Your girlfriend, your boyfriend, your kids, your parents

1275
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:12,220
Do something with each other, do something stupid

1276
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:14,220
Like something old fashioned

1277
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:18,220
Yeah, take a walk or cook a meal together

1278
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:20,220
Enjoy it

1279
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:23,220
Because the tough times they're still ahead

1280
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:24,220
They really are

1281
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,220
But we're going to get through it

1282
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:28,220
We're not the first ones and certainly won't be the last

1283
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:31,220
Whatever you do live your life with passion

1284
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:33,220
Another fine, medium presentation

1285
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:35,220
Stick it in your ear
