Make a statement with Sony stereo ear buds, sleek metal housings that reduce vibration

00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,280

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:22,040

Delta Shira Charley, 708.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,320
Dynamic programming is what's all been missing.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,320
That's the reason that you had swalli to do this click and listen.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,320
You all came to the place where you can make a statement.

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,320
Reclaim it, regain control of entertainment.

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,320
Real people with ideas that stretch to go to is only one spot you can do that.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,320
This pot show, the game is shut down of the company's lay down.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,320
We're changing the rules and things stay sane now.

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,320
We're pot showers doing others want to copy us.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,320
These catches like old hamburgers, they need to catch up.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,320
The whack shows, whack shows with no spine any atty.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,320
They're drowning in the sea in thirst for originality.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,320
Pot show, both tsunami and earthquake.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,320
To wave with the future and y'all are just in our wake.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,320
Pot show the endless gorilla stint in that supervillain making the cannon still.

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,320
We're ripping it before the cellar.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,320
Pot show up in the supervillain making the cannon still.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,320
Pot show up in the supervillain making the cannon still.

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,320
Pot show up in the supervillain making the cannon still.

23
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,320
Pot show up in the supervillain making the cannon still.

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Pot show up in the supervillain making the cannon still.

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,320
Pot show up in the supervillain making the cannon still.

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,320
We're $16K employers worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,320
And the next generation radio content, in my ears.

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,320
I like to think I'm flying into this況.

29
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,820
Autistic, here's a new curry!

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,820
You are listening to the number one threat to our national security, Adam Curry.

31
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,320
I let off the airways, here is my request.

32
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,320
You don't have to play it, but I'll kill you best.

33
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:17,320
I've been listening to you show on the radio.

34
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,320
And you seem like a friend to me.

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,320
I'm your coach, I don't mind.

36
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,320
I'd be happy just to hear good boys say,

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,320
and this is for the girl who didn't sign her name.

38
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,320
Yes, she needs a dedication just to say.

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Let us learn our stories,

40
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,320
swimming from place to place, my client Jason Slider.

41
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,320
People say I'm weary, but that's just a company I keep.

42
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,320
You make the night and race.

43
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,320
Ooh, I don't need to see your face.

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,320
You're sounding new.

45
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,320
You sounding good.

46
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,320
You sounding good to me.

47
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,320
I love the airways, here is my request.

48
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,320
You don't have to play it, but I'll kill you best.

49
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,320
I've been listening to you show on the radio.

50
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,320
And you seem like a friend to me.

51
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,320
I love the airways, here is my request.

52
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,320
You're sounding new.

53
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
You're sounding new.

54
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Leave us, night and race,

55
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,320
swimming from place to place, my client Jason Slider.

56
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:07,320
People say I'm weary, but that's just a company I keep.

57
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,320
You make the night and race.

58
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Ooh, I don't need to see your face.

59
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
You're sounding good.

60
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,320
You sounding new.

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,320
You sounding good to me.

62
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,320
You're sounding new.

63
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,320
You're sounding new.

64
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,320
You're sounding new.

65
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,320
You don't have to play it, but I'll kill you best.

66
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,320
I've been listening to you show on the radio.

67
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,320
And you seem like a friend to me.

68
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,320
Ooh, I've been listening to you show on the radio.

69
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,320
And you seem like a friend to me.

70
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,320
I love the airways, here is my request.

71
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,320
You don't have to play it, but I'll kill you best.

72
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,320
I've been listening to you show on the radio.

73
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,320
And you seem like a friend to me.

00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,320
courtesy of the organization to the preservation of the soundtrack of our lives.

75
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Charlie Doer, pilot of the airways.

76
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Hey, everybody.

77
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
How you doing?

78
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Welcome to the daily source code episode number seven hundred and eight.

79
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,320
The title that song showed up in one of my filters somewhere.

80
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
I can't remember it showed up yesterday.

81
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
I started to hunt around the net for it.

82
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
I looked on iTunes, couldn't find it.

83
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:41,320
I looked at my favorite MP3 search engine, seekpod.com.

84
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,320
It did show up one result, but it was a broken link.

85
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,320
And then finally, I found like a dog pile or whatever.

86
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,320
A really, really crappy version.

87
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Very low, fidelatye.

88
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,320
And I remember the song a little bit hyper.

89
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Then the what it sounded like just now.

90
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
But I don't know.

91
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
Just felt right today.

92
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,320
It's really crappy outside here in the United Kingdom.

93
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Of course, coming to you from the curry manner.

94
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,320
We're in the attic in the manner here on the west side of G-town.

95
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
The affluent suburb of Surrey known as Gilford.

96
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,320
And Gailforce wins.

97
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
No flying from me.

98
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
Not today.

99
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Although I have to tell you, I did dream about flying last night.

100
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
It's getting time to get.

101
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
It's been a couple of weeks.

102
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,320
In fact, I was it's a crazy dream.

103
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,320
I dreamt that I was flying a king air.

104
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
B-90.

105
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Oh, maybe it was a C-90.

106
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,320
It was a big twin engine.

107
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
And I was flying all by myself.

108
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,320
And I was doing a lot of take-offs and landings.

109
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,320
Not quite what that means.

110
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,320
And this morning when I woke up, Patricia said that she had a dress.

111
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
She had, she told me.

112
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,320
She had a sexual dream about Tony Blair, which is quite concerning.

113
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,320
And I think there's reasons why she's having weird dreams.

114
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,320
And finally, today, I'll be able to tell you a little bit about what's going on

115
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
with the lady Patricia.

116
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,320
It's kind of a personal thing.

117
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,320
And I didn't feel like I could talk about it just yet.

118
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Nor did I actually have permission from her to discuss it.

119
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
So, all you'll just have to wait.

120
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
I'll be talking about that a little bit later on in this show.

121
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,320
For those of you who are looking to curry.com thinking, is he going to do a live show today?

122
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Obviously not because I said if it was going to happen, it would be around 7 a.m.

123
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
Eastern Standard Time.

124
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
It's probably 8 a.m. now.

125
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Yeah, about 1 p.m.

126
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Here in the UK.

127
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,320
Plenty of reasons over the number one reason.

128
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
I'm just not ready yet.

129
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
I tried testing some stuff out.

130
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,320
Yes, they actually.

131
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:37,320
I got several really good suggestions of software and systems to try.

132
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
One of these is this.

133
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
Check this out.

134
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
I don't have them.

135
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
This is for confirmed German.

136
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Well, it's just listening to your show.

137
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,320
You're talking about the tool to interact with your listeners.

138
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,320
And I think I've just got there.

139
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,320
I think it's called Adobe Connect Professional.

140
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,320
Formerly called Mechan Media Breeze and they bought it.

141
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,320
It's a flash based online tool.

142
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
You can log on.

143
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,320
You can talk to your listeners.

144
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
They can talk back.

145
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,320
You could even connect the webcam.

146
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,320
So they can see you.

147
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
They can connect the webcam.

148
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Let them.

149
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,320
I'm using it in my university with fellow students.

150
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
So if you want, check it out.

151
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
Yeah.

152
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
Love you, John.

153
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Yeah.

154
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,320
John.

155
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,320
Yeah, I don't know if that's, you know, the webcam stuff is completely irrelevant.

156
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,320
In fact, I don't want people being able to look in and see me here in the studio.

157
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
It's something young, pull that loves doing.

158
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
And we do have a hit test coming up later.

159
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,320
In this program, since I will not be able to produce a footballer Friday show tomorrow.

160
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Because I, I'm going into the city.

161
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,320
So it's just no way I'm going to be able to handle it.

162
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,320
So I'm not, I'm not really big on the webcam thing.

163
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,320
But I have to say hands down the most pimples.

164
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
Hey, you pimples out there.

165
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,320
The most pimples out there sent in this as a suggestion.

166
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Yeah, I'm just listening to a DSC must have been 707.

167
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,320
And you were talking about doing a live interaction.

168
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,320
You know, there's a website called Talk to you that kind of does that.

169
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,320
And it's kind of cool because it allows you to, um,

170
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,320
for the, the colors to wait on hold and then you have a, um,

171
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,320
interface until allow you to unmute people and stuff like that.

172
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Um, there's, uh, people that are using it.

173
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Um, then at night or, um, I figure what they call it.

174
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,320
It was Adam, or Amber McCarthy and Leo Leport.

175
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
They do that and then you stalked you.

176
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
So check it out. Talk to you dot com.

177
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Talk to you later Adam.

178
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Thank you. Yeah, you know, I did check it out.

179
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,320
I set up an account and I tried to, uh,

180
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,320
to get a feel for how it was going to work in a real-life situation.

181
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Um, and obviously I had no one else to call in.

182
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,320
So it was a little, uh, just,

183
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,320
I just didn't really have the time to focus on it entirely.

184
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,320
Although looking at the screenshots, it seems like it does have a lot of the,

185
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
a lot of the pieces that I'd want to use.

186
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,320
So that would be, uh, certainly it's high on the list as a contender.

187
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Um, thinking about maybe doing some experiments over the weekend.

188
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
Just keep your eye on curry dot com.

189
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Um, because that's where I'll announce.

190
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Uh, and I also couldn't figure out how to make the announcement link work.

191
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
And yeah, it just, I'm sorry.

192
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
It was just too much going on.

193
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Um, and also, um, what is it, uh,

194
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
uh, net meeting?

195
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
No, is it net meeting?

196
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
That's not what it is.

197
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
It's, uh, maybe it is.

198
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Go to meeting?

199
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
No, what is it?

200
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
WebEx.

201
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
That's it.

202
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,320
I know WebEx has a pretty good system because we use that for our, um,

203
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
our, our pod show football Friday.

204
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,320
So when we connect all the offices up and we do presentations,

205
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
what's nice about that.

206
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Obviously, it's stuff that I don't need for the show.

207
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,320
You know, you can show, um, your screen, essentially.

208
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Uh, you can share that.

209
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Um, I do know that the conference bridge is reasonably good.

210
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
So it'll be one of those two.

211
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
I'm pretty sure.

212
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Uh, just stay tuned as I said to curry dot com.

213
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320
We're going to, we're going to give it a whirl.

214
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
We'll get to it.

215
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
Let's see.

216
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Um, lady Patricia, I want to tell you about her first this.

217
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Allow me to introduce myself.

218
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Macedonia, the name.

219
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Beatsots, the acronym for the website and the show you need to have within your pod catcher been.

220
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Both sides of the surface.

221
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Independent and pod safe and worth the time it takes to zone out to the tones that you're

222
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
up in your headphones.

223
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Hip hop, soul, funk and electronic harmonics that are sonically rich in nutrients,

224
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,320
guaranteed to give your mind body and soul what it needs.

225
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Got it.

226
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:39,320
Let's start fulfilling broadband dreams through dial-up means an August of 2005 and continues to keep true vibes a lot.

227
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Immentators with whack music gets stomped out like a roach.

228
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,320
All this from the poor man's podcast as low fine approach.

229
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
But high fine results.

230
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Seriously.

231
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
You need to check this radio.

232
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Beatsots.

233
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
www.beatsots.com.

234
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
www.beats.com.

235
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,320
www.beats.com.

236
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Hey, I made another run.

237
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Yeah.

238
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Interesting show.

239
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
I love it when people do street poetry.

240
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,320
What the hell is that?

241
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,320
That's my Nokia Connect box.

242
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
At least that's what I call it.

243
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,320
Since I use a US cell phone, a US number that is on the Nokia E61 eye.

244
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
It's very expensive for data.

245
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,320
So I have my old E61, not the eye, just the regular E61, which Christina was using for a while.

246
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
We call it the brick.

247
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
It's literally indestructible.

248
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,320
I think a T-Mobile local T-Mobile account in there.

249
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
I use that for data.

250
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,320
I just throw it in my bag essentially.

251
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,320
When I'm using the N80010 web tablet on the road, it connects to it automatically through

252
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Bluetooth, which is a perfect combination I might add.

253
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
But of course, it's T-Mobile.

254
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
So I can see from the number.

255
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
It's an 800 number.

256
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,320
It's probably T-Mobile calling to offer me something.

257
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
I really hate it when they do that.

258
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
So ignore.

259
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Anyway, the Lady Patricia.

260
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,320
It's been so difficult not to tell you about what's been going on with her.

261
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,320
And it really just wasn't my place to talk about it.

262
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,320
But yesterday she said it was okay for me to discuss it on the show.

263
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Now, you remember Monday, I said that I didn't do a show because there was some, I was in the hospital.

264
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,320
And I said everything was okay, but there was a lot of stuff going on.

265
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,320
And I kind of left it at that left some cryptic messages.

266
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,320
It was Patricia was in the hospital.

267
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
And let me explain why.

268
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,320
For those of you who've been listening to this show, you know that for the past year Patricia

269
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,320
has had often on some really serious abdominal pains.

270
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,320
This actually started in December of 2006 when she did the celebrity version of Dancing

271
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,320
with the stars or strictly come dancing as we say here in the UK.

272
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
She did that in the Netherlands.

273
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,320
And her dancing partner, your professional dancing partner, had done a lift on her.

274
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,320
And he kind of squeezed in her on her right side.

275
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,320
And she woke up in the middle of the night, you know, literally puking from pain.

276
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,320
And you know, she rushed to the hospital.

277
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
They tried to figure it out.

278
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,320
You know, they said, well, maybe it was something to do with her kidneys.

279
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,320
It could have been some kind of, you know, like kidney, not stones, but dust that would

280
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,320
had dislodged or something while she was doing all this extraneous exercise.

281
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,320
And this has basically been going on for a year now.

282
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,320
And we're varying degrees.

283
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,320
You know, sometimes it wouldn't bother her at all for weeks on end.

284
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:42,320
And then she would just have these incredibly painful attacks literally in her, in her side.

285
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,320
And I got to tell you, we've been through the mill here.

286
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,320
We have been through to every single doctor, every single specialist.

287
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,320
She's in the past, oh, in the past a couple months alone.

288
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,320
She's had the scans, you know, like a cat scan, you know, for cancer.

289
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,320
She had something that she definitely didn't want to talk about on the show.

290
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Call an Oscar P.

291
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
It's not a very lady like thing.

292
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,320
You know, I've been with her throughout all of this.

293
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,320
And I have to tell you, it's really been a little bit concerning, worrying because, you know,

294
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,320
if you go off on her own and travel to the Netherlands, she can get an attack at any moment.

295
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,320
And you know, what if it happens on the airplane or just when there's no one there to help or so,

296
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
you know, it's been very worrisome.

297
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,320
And when I've been away for weeks on end in the States, you know, I keep the phone next to my bed.

298
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,320
And just hoping that it doesn't ring in the middle of the night with, oh, my God, you know,

299
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
I don't know how to attack.

300
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
And I don't know what to do.

301
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
That would be Christina, probably.

302
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:55,320
So we found another specialist, Professor Bailey, who is, and it guts, I guess, is his specialty.

303
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
He speaks all over the world.

304
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,320
And of course, this is not part of the National Health Care System here in the UK.

305
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:08,320
If you actually wanted to do all the things that we've done through the NHS, she would probably be,

306
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:16,320
it's still being a lot of pain and a lot of trouble because it takes so long to get, you know, anyone to sign off on anything.

307
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,320
And honestly, I questioned some of the, some of the quality of the health care because we found out.

308
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,320
So essentially, she had another attack.

309
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,320
This was just around the holidays.

310
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
And a really severe one.

311
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,320
And you know, and so my wife is lying here on the couch, you know, in tears saying,

312
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,320
you know, this is worse than contractions when I was pregnant.

313
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Now, that's saying a lot to me, even though I, of course, have, you know, have no comparison.

314
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,320
I do understand what she's talking about.

315
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,320
So we called the Professor Bailey and said, look, we got to do something.

316
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
He said, all right, let's immediately.

317
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
And this was last week.

318
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,320
He said, let's, let's do a laparoscopy laparoscopy is where they make several small,

319
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,320
keyhole incisions and going with the camera.

320
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:09,320
Essentially, go take a look at what's going on with the, with her bowels.

321
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,320
And oh, by the way, you know, I've had the barefoot doctor over here.

322
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
I've had him do hand laying.

323
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,320
I've had, you know, I've had fucking mojo voodoo guys.

324
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,320
I've tried everything because you get so desperate, you know, and, and all the doctors say,

325
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,320
well, it's irritable bowel syndrome.

326
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
If fuck that, it's not irritable.

327
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
That's excruciating bowel syndrome.

328
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,320
And of course, what does irritable bowel syndrome really mean?

329
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:37,320
It's just a description for, you know, the area of where shit is messed up.

330
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,320
It's not really a diagnosis.

331
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,320
So, and she went on Monday.

332
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,320
And that's, of course, why I couldn't do the show.

333
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:54,320
And, you know, obviously, you know, when you're going into full general anesthetic,

334
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,320
you know, there's a, it's never really a fun ride.

335
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,320
And with her heart condition, there's all kinds of little nuances and little, you know,

336
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,320
little things that you have to be very careful of, particularly because her blood doesn't

337
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,320
clot as fast as others because of all the data blockers that she's taking.

338
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,320
So, you know, there's all kinds of parameters.

339
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,320
You know, it's, you know, it's, although it's a, it's a very common procedure.

340
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,320
It's concerning to say the least.

341
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,320
So, who went in around 11 a.m.

342
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
They came to take her away.

343
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
What is it about 130?

344
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
You know, it always lasts hours.

345
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Takes hours for them to get that shit together.

346
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,320
And so I sat there for a couple hours, you know, pacing the room, waiting,

347
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,320
and then Professor Bailey came back in and he said, you are not going to believe this.

348
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,320
By the way, not necessarily what you want to hear from the doctor.

349
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,320
When he comes back after, you know that your wife's been operated on,

350
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
says you're not going to believe this.

351
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
So, let's take a look at the pictures.

352
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Of course, I always ask for four video and pictures.

353
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
When is a camera involved?

354
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,320
And like, dude, would you please take some pictures or give me an MP4 files?

355
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
At least I have some record.

356
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,320
I've lots of interesting video of the insides of my wife.

357
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,320
He said, it was her appendix.

358
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
And he showed me this picture.

359
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,320
And this, my poor, my poor wife, poor girl.

360
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,320
She's been walking around with an infected appendix.

361
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,320
Probably for the better part of a year.

362
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
It's undetected.

363
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,320
I mean, it makes no sense.

364
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:30,320
She's had scans and tests and blood tests specifically to see if it had anything to do with her appendix.

365
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,320
And, you know, and no one called it, no one, no one pegged it.

366
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,320
Let's, let's put it that.

367
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,320
And Professor Bailey said, this is really, this is, he was angry.

368
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,320
He was really, and he's going to delve into this.

369
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,320
So he says, and talk to the people who did the scans and the other tests.

370
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,320
It was just an inflamed ball of crap sitting in there.

371
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,320
And it was the entire problem.

372
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
So appendix to me.

373
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
He, he ripped it right out.

374
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
And, and that was it.

375
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,320
Of course, you know, it's, it's still a major operation.

376
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,320
So Patricia, it's home.

377
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,320
She had to stay overnight.

378
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,320
I see.

379
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
I didn't tell you any of this.

380
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,320
You see how hard this must have been for me.

381
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,320
I was just bursting at the seams trying to explain.

382
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,320
But of course, I couldn't because, you know,

383
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
A, we didn't know it was going on B.

384
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,320
I didn't know if she even wanted me to talk about it.

385
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:23,320
But she is so happy that this alien infected life form has been removed from her body.

386
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Even though she has a lot of pain still from the actual incisions,

387
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,320
because they make three of them for this keyhole operation.

388
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,320
And, and also, you know, they pump you full with air and gas.

389
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,320
And so she has, you know, pain in her shoulders.

390
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,320
Anyone who's who's been opened up kind of knows what that's like.

391
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
So the good news is we found it.

392
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
It's taken care of.

393
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,320
She can normal life can resume.

394
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
It can resume.

395
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,320
And once again, just goes to show how important health is.

396
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,320
And I wish great health for all of you for 2008.

397
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,320
And I'm sure I'll get the lady pee on maybe next week,

398
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,320
because I was planning on going to the States,

399
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,320
but I have to stay home because of the anesthesia and everything.

400
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
She's not even allowed to drive until the end of next week.

401
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,320
So Christina and I are, you know,

402
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,320
basically trying to keep the household running.

403
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,320
Doing a reasonable job, not the best of all jobs,

404
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,320
but a reasonable job.

405
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,320
So anyway, now you're up to speed on what's going on here.

406
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,320
And finally, getting some answers on the primaries,

407
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,320
how they work, and how these caucuses put together,

408
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
I'll put together.

409
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
Let me just give you a couple of pieces of feedback here,

410
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,320
because I think for those of you who are interested in what this actually is that's going on.

411
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,320
You know, which, of course, the mainstream media makes it look like we're already

412
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,320
electing a president, and there's already winners and losers.

413
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
Nothing could be further from the truth.

414
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
Particularly if you see what happened in New Hampshire,

415
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
boy, what an upset there.

416
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Gee, the polls were wrong.

417
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Go figure, why were they wrong?

418
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,320
Adam Denny says, hi, listening to your last show in a caucus.

419
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,320
People gather in groups, and they declare who they are for,

420
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,320
and people try to get the most votes for their favorite person.

421
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
And Iowa, the Democratic caucuses,

422
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,320
there you had to have 15% or better.

423
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,320
If the caucus, if the candidate in that caucus doesn't get the 15%

424
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
then the votes go to someone else.

425
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,320
So essentially, in this caucus, the parties sit together,

426
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
and they decide who their candidate is going to be,

427
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,320
and who's going to get the votes.

428
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,320
So primaries, as Adam Denny says,

429
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,320
is just like a regular election.

430
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,320
One thing to remember is that primaries is about winning delegates

431
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
to the convention.

432
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,320
I'm sure you've heard of the Democratic convention,

433
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,320
and the Republican convention.

434
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,320
So you want the delegates to go to this convention.

435
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:45,320
Those are the ones that are going to put forward the candidate.

436
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:50,320
So delegates is actually trying to read this here.

437
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,320
It's a little discombobula.

438
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,320
Delegates is who actually votes for the nominee.

439
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
There you go.

440
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,320
A perfect example is Mitt Romney, who came in twice,

441
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,320
who came in twice, who came in second,

442
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,320
and first in another election.

443
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,320
But as more delegates than the rest of the candidates.

444
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,320
So winning the state doesn't really mean that much.

445
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
It's all about the delegates.

446
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,320
So when you look at these results,

447
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,320
look at how many delegates each of the candidates has,

448
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,320
because the delegates are the ones that go to the convention,

449
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,320
and from there they choose their candidate,

450
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,320
and then we go into a general election for the presidency.

451
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,320
Here's another way to look at it.

452
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Say Adam, it's Jesse and you answered your essay column.

453
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Listen to the B.F.C. 7.6 in your explanation

454
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,320
of how the U.S. presidential election process works.

455
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,320
I think you did a good job, man.

456
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,320
I know.

457
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,320
I'll thank you for even more of the things and clear

458
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
in the three minutes you asked for.

459
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,320
The only point I would clarify,

460
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,320
or add to having voted in New Hampshire

461
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
in the primary yesterday myself.

462
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,320
You do not necessarily have to be registered as a Democrat.

463
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
All of the Republicans to vote in.

464
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,320
That's the corresponding primary.

465
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,320
Many voters, particularly in New Hampshire,

466
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,320
are registered as independent or on declared.

467
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,320
And they won't give them the choice of which primary to vote.

468
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
And then they can only vote in one or the other.

469
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,320
But I can choose these kind of going to vote

470
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,320
which primary I will vote in.

471
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,320
And I did my duty yesterday.

472
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,320
And I made choose to vote in a different party next time.

473
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,320
That's all.

474
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,320
Thanks.

475
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,320
All right, man.

476
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
Thank you.

477
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,320
Love you.

478
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
No, homo.

479
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
This is a great story.

480
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
I don't know if you picked this one up.

481
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
I saw it on techcrunch.com.

482
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,320
This just goes to show you how stupid the mainstream media is.

483
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Now, in this case, it's the French mainstream media,

484
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
but you're just going to love this.

485
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,320
So apparently someone came up with an application on Facebook,

486
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:52,320
which made it look like this application was to elect

487
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,320
the president of Facebook.

488
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,320
And, you know, so you install it.

489
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
And then you can put yourself up as a candidate.

490
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
And then you could get votes.

491
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,320
And so this guy who I have to admit this guy looks very

492
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,320
presidential, which is named Arash Derem Barsh.

493
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
I'll put a link in the show.

494
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
And it's a daily source code.com.

495
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,320
So you can look at the read through the whole story.

496
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
It's just hilarious.

497
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,320
So he won this application's version of an election.

498
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
I don't like 9,000 votes or something.

499
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
It doesn't really matter.

500
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,320
But all of the French media jumped on the story.

501
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,320
And they're like, oh my god, it is fantastic.

502
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,320
The president of Facebook is Frenchman.

503
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,320
And every single big news outlet,

504
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,320
TF1, Le Plan, Express, France, International,

505
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,320
The Parisian, every single one of them reported on the story

506
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
without even checking with Facebook.

507
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,320
How hard can that be to check the source of the story?

508
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
And it's just, it's just,

509
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,320
for my mind, just another nail in the coffin of mainstream media.

510
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
You guys are so fucking lame.

511
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,320
And, you know, because other people reported on it,

512
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
we figured it's all copy and paste.

513
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,320
That's what I need to do.

514
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
I need to find that link.

515
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Let me just write this down on my notebook here.

516
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,320
I wrote many years ago the copy paste culture.

517
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,320
And essay, I wonder if it's, it's probably

518
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
have to go to the way back machine to get a copy of it.

519
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
But I'll put a link in the show.

520
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,320
No time to look at that.

521
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,320
The copy paste culture, because this is exactly what mainstream media is all about.

522
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
It's all about copy paste.

523
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,320
There's absolutely no fact checking done whatsoever.

524
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,320
And what a great scam from these guys,

525
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,320
who put this together, really fantastic.

526
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,320
Okay.

527
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,320
As said, tomorrow, no football Friday,

528
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
because I'm going into the city.

529
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
We got all kinds of meetings and stuff.

530
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,320
I'm really, because of all this appendix crap.

531
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
I'm way behind on meetings.

532
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,320
So, I just got to catch up on stuff.

533
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,320
Luckily, Mr. Yon Poled is on the ball.

534
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,320
And he has put in his hit test submission early.

535
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,320
So, let's enjoy hit test one.

536
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
Oh, four.

537
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,320
One crowd casting.

538
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,320
With Adam curve.

539
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
The video version once again.

540
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
You ready to be stumped.

541
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
Because he is the good texture.

542
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,320
With Yon Poled.

543
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Hey, Adam, this is hit test number 104.

544
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,320
And we're going to start right away with intro number one.

545
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
The next.

546
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
That's it.

547
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,320
Hit it.

548
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,320
Um, uh, Fleetwood Mac, go your own way.

549
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,320
Yeah.

550
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,320
Number two.

551
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Uh.

552
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,320
Uh.

553
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Uh.

554
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
Uh.

555
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
Uh.

556
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,320
Good.

557
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,320
Uh.

558
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
Uh.

559
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
Everyone's champagne king.

560
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,320
Shame.

561
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,320
Keep the fire burning.

562
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
Something like that.

563
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,320
And the final one is number three.

564
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
Out.

565
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,320
Wait.

566
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
Yon.

567
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,320
Do you really want to hit me?

568
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
Good songs, Yon.

569
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,320
I think I got them all this time.

570
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Not sure about everyone's champagne king though.

571
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
And times up in these ID answers.

572
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,320
Answer number one is from 1977.

573
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
Love and hear.

574
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,320
It's the right thing to do.

575
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,320
You can go your own way.

576
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,320
Go your own way.

577
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,320
You can go this under the right day.

578
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,320
Don't leave it.

579
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,320
You can go your own way.

580
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
This is not you before.

581
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,320
Good.

582
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
But Fleetwood Mac can go your own way.

583
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,320
But thanks for suggesting the song.

584
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,320
This is answer number two.

585
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
I love this song.

586
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
From 1978.

587
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,320
Evelyn King.

588
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
This is Shane.

589
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Shane.

590
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,320
Good.

591
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Keep the fire burning.

592
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Yeah.

593
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,320
There you go.

594
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,320
I got it right.

595
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,320
Shane.

596
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,320
Keep the fire burning.

597
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,320
Yeah.

598
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Your home.

599
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,320
That's my home.

600
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Shane.

601
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,320
Oh man.

602
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
That takes me back.

603
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,320
And what happened?

604
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,320
That feeling champagne king.

605
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,320
As answer number two.

606
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320
And this is answer number three.

607
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,320
Wow.

608
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,320
Do you really want to hurt me?

609
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,320
Do you really want to make me cry?

610
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,320
Bit by by without reason.

611
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,320
I'm prepared to let you go.

612
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:35,320
Do you really want to hurt me?

613
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,320
Do you really want to make me cry?

614
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
Boy, George.

615
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,320
Yo.

616
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Do you really want to hurt me?

617
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
And do you really want to hurt me from 1982?

618
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
As answer number three.

619
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,320
And that's it for hit this number one out four.

620
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,320
Yeah.

621
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
So Adam, how did you do?

622
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
Three out of three on.

623
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,320
As always.

624
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,320
And I keep repeating myself at the end of the hit test.

625
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,320
The iTunes link so you can buy these tracks online together with the answers to this hit test.

626
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,320
Or to be found at hittest.barsho.com.

627
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,320
Thank you for playing again Adam.

628
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,320
Thank you for listening everybody else.

629
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,320
And watch it.

630
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
And next we got to be back for hit this number 105.

631
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,320
So until then, take care.

632
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,320
Bye bye.

633
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,320
For feedback, test at gmail.com.

634
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,320
info, young bullet.com.

635
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,320
And POLVT.com.

636
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,320
So, if you look at hittest.barsho.com.

637
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
You can see the video version of this.

638
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320
I got to tell you.

639
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,320
First of all, the production value is amazing.

640
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,320
And Yon, what exactly is this guy has a studio?

641
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,320
I'm jealous of it.

642
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,320
Yon, would you please write down what,

643
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,320
I mean, I'm looking at these at some awesome looking software that you're using.

644
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,320
For the audio, you've got a beautiful mixer and please.

645
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,320
I want a YonPolette studio, man.

646
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,320
You know, it's all fine and dandy, but that shit looks good.

647
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,320
I'm jealous.

648
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,320
All right.

649
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
I'm turning green here.

650
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
Another great hit test.

651
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,320
Thank you very much, Mr. YonPolette.

652
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,320
See what else do I have here?

653
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,320
Of course, you probably heard about the video of these Iranian fast boats

654
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,320
that apparently were circling around US warships in international waters,

655
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,320
so they claim.

656
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:35,320
But the Iranians, this is another one of those mainstream media things.

657
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,320
The Iranians are saying, you know, the video that the US showed was fake.

658
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,320
And they have their own version of the video, where these guys are basically just

659
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,320
rolling out to the ships and saying, hey, are you doing?

660
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
We're over here.

661
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
You're over there.

662
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,320
And I don't know who to believe in this.

663
00:31:51,320 --> 00:32:00,320
But I certainly would be very dismayed if this was being used as a catalyst to go to war with Iran.

664
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
Let's be very, very careful people.

665
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,320
And let's not just believe any kind of video that's being put out there with the

666
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,320
connotations of they're being an attack on US property.

667
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
Really, really concerning.

668
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,320
I'll put a link to that story.

669
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,320
I'm sure you've heard about or read about it by now.

670
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,320
Oh, and this one, this is this really pissed me off.

671
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,320
You know, I'm a big fan of GoDaddy.

672
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:32,320
And of course, you can use my codes to get great deals on domain names at godaddy.com.

673
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,320
If you want to domain name for $6.95, which is nothing,

674
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
you can use checkout code DSC3.

675
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,320
And I have two other codes.

676
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,320
You can find them in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

677
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
You can use those for, you know,

678
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
that's like, I think there's a 30% offer,

679
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
offers an offer or 10%.

680
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,320
It's a good deal.

681
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,320
It's all written down there, so use those.

682
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,320
But I've always wondered about this.

683
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
Apparently, network solutions.

684
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,320
And this was a story uncovered by the Enquirer,

685
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,320
which is kind of like a tech news site here.

686
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,320
That's produced here in the UK.

687
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,320
Apparently, what these guys have been doing

688
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,320
and I have wondered about this.

689
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,320
If you search for a domain name, so let's say,

690
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,320
love you know homo.com, which is, would be,

691
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,320
by the way, it's a great domain name.

692
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,320
If you search for that,

693
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,320
it'll show up as taken,

694
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,320
because what these guys, what these cock suckers,

695
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,320
we're doing, and I don't know if they're still doing it.

696
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,320
What they were doing is they'd take the search,

697
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,320
you know, it's called a who is search.

698
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,320
And if you search through their domain name,

699
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,320
they'd take the results of that search,

700
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,320
and immediately reserve that domain name,

701
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,320
so that you could only buy it through them.

702
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,320
I think there's like a five day grace period

703
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,320
where they can do that kind of stuff.

704
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,320
And I've always wondered about that.

705
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
I've always thought, you know,

706
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
me with conspiracies, right?

707
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,320
I always thought, it doesn't make a lot of sense

708
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,320
for a company who has evil intentions.

709
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,320
To look at the search that someone's doing

710
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
on a domain name.

711
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
And then immediately claim and say, oh, no, sorry,

712
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,320
you can back order it and charge them twice as much.

713
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,320
This is exactly what these guys were doing.

714
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,320
I don't know about the charging twice as much bit,

715
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,320
but they were definitely reserving it

716
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,320
so that if you then went to, if you search for it on godaddy.com,

717
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,320
it would show up as already taken.

718
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,320
So you could only register it in that five day period

719
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
through network solutions.

720
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,320
I think these guys should be fucking crucified for this.

721
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,320
That's really, really nodding.

722
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,320
And frankly, I'm annoyed that this isn't getting

723
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,320
a lot more play.

724
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,320
So again, link in the show notes,

725
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,320
dailysourcecode.com.

726
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,320
You should check that out for sure.

727
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
All right.

728
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,320
Let's talk about some music here for a second.

729
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
Hi, Adam.

730
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,320
This is Justin from San Francisco,

731
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
calling again.

732
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,320
I just finished listening to the black crow.

733
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
I'm going to do you see it now.

734
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
Amazing.

735
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
Awesome.

736
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,320
Except for one thing.

737
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,320
I noticed you encode your show at 96.

738
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,320
Oh my God.

739
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,320
I mean, it's okay if it's just talking

740
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,320
about when you play music and when you play good music,

741
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,320
like the black crow, it sounds like crabs.

742
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Can't you bump that up just a little bit?

743
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
I think my heart drives mine.

744
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,320
I part can handle a couple more megabytes of your show.

745
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
Can you think, consider doing that for me?

746
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,320
All right.

747
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,320
Thanks, Adam.

748
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,320
Very interesting.

749
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,320
Yeah.

750
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,320
Love you, too.

751
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,320
No, homo.

752
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,320
Very interesting.

753
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
You know, the bit rates.

754
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
This is what he's talking about.

755
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,320
Basically, the quality that this show is recorded with

756
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,320
is something that we experimented with many years ago

757
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
and really tried to find the perfect balance between

758
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
file size and quality.

759
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,320
So the next obvious step up would be, I guess,

760
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,320
128 kilobit per second encoding rate instead of

761
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
what I'm doing now, which is 96.

762
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,320
And, you know, we really thought that this was

763
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
more or less the sweet spot.

764
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,320
And I think a lot of people recorded this bit rate

765
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,320
because, you know, now it's basically about a megabyte

766
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,320
per minute of audio that is created.

767
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,320
Which I think is just about right.

768
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,320
And I understand what you're saying where you know,

769
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
you wish you could hear a better quality copy of it.

770
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,320
But I guess in that case, you should go buy the track, right?

771
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,320
That's, or actually, there's another question about it.

772
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
A good one that relates to this.

773
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
You know, for those of you who just want to consume music,

774
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,320
if you're not a producer, if you're not making shows,

775
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,320
what do you do with pod save music?

776
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,320
I don't know, it's been able from running area again.

777
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,320
Just go to, to say, just with me in 707,

778
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,320
and you talked about pod save, what have you.

779
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,320
But it was mostly from the artist's point of view,

780
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,320
and the producer's point of view.

781
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,320
And I've been a bit mystified kind of from the listener point of view

782
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,320
and a music consumer point of view.

783
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,320
What the kind of correct way of proceeding is,

784
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,320
if you like a song that you hear on a pod show,

785
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,320
am I supposed to go to the pod save music network

786
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,320
and download it, or am I supposed to go and buy it from somewhere?

787
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Or do I have to go and see where the band published it?

788
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,320
Just wondering, how about the side of the business works?

789
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,320
And who I should give my money to, because it was,

790
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,320
and I don't like, I don't like you, but I do like you.

791
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,320
I'm just, well, you know, make some emotions.

792
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,320
It's hard. Mixed, I know.

793
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,320
It's hard.

794
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
Oh, you do love me if it's hard.

795
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,320
Yeah, okay, so that's a very good question, actually.

796
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,320
Now, whenever I play a song from the pod save music network,

797
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,320
you'll see in the show notes that I link to a page at podshow.com.

798
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,320
Now, this link will not take you to the pod save music network,

799
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,320
but it takes you to the artist's page at podshow.com.

800
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,320
And right there, you'll be able to play all of the songs

801
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,320
in the quality that the artist uploaded it to the network in,

802
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
which is usually pretty high quality.

803
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,320
You know, all things considered about MP3s, which, of course,

804
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,320
in general are just really not that great when it comes to quality.

805
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,320
We are really depriving our ears of quality music,

806
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,320
but that's a whole another conversation for another day.

807
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,320
Right there, you can take the player, the artist's player,

808
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,320
and you can export that, you can insert into your webpage,

809
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,320
you can put it on your Facebook, or your MySpace,

810
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,320
or your Weblog, or whatever.

811
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,320
And you can play one song, you can play all of them through.

812
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,320
Now, some of the artists have made these tracks available for purchase,

813
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,320
and there's a little green buy mark next to it.

814
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,320
And essentially, you can then buy that track,

815
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,320
which will be a free and clear MP3 to download.

816
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
Or you can go look at the artist's website.

817
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
They often have free downloads available,

818
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
or they'll have links to iTunes.

819
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,320
I mean, that's kind of the whole idea here.

820
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,320
You know, when you listen to a song on the regular terrestrial radio,

821
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,320
it's all compressed, and the quality is all fucked up,

822
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,320
just because of the way radio stations make their signal sound.

823
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
Very much like I do.

824
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,320
I mean, I compress the shit out of my show, because the way I want it to sound.

825
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,320
If you really want the song, the whole point is you've heard the song,

826
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,320
you like the song, go buy it, go buy it, search for it on iTunes,

827
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,320
go to emusic.com, go to Amazon,

828
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,320
that is essentially the point.

829
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,320
If you really want the quality from the, by the way,

830
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,320
go to CDBaby.com, get the CD, so you get a really high quality version.

831
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,320
That's kind of the way it's supposed to work.

832
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,320
So the freebie part is that you hear it on your favorite show,

833
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,320
that you're able to listen to it online,

834
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,320
just like, you know, you can listen to lots of artists tracks

835
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,320
on, you know, with a my space player or whatever.

836
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,320
You can, you can kind of get the, you know, get the emotion,

837
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,320
get the vibe of the song.

838
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,320
And if you want it, that's the point we were counting on you

839
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,320
to fulfill your end of the bargain.

840
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,320
Go buy the song, support the artist.

841
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,320
That's the way it's supposed to work.

842
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,320
And I have to say, so far, I'm pretty pleased.

843
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,320
Adam Curry, with 16 million dollars with their planes,

844
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
grab my ass.

845
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:56,320
This is Mark, Mark's the,

846
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,320
I have something, might be interested,

847
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,320
a guy named Chip Tatum.

848
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,320
If you do search on Google,

849
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,320
YouTube or something about search,

850
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,320
it's not really really interesting stuff about,

851
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
you know, whole free CIA thing,

852
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,320
and very interesting stuff.

853
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,320
Stuff you haven't talked about yet.

854
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,320
So yeah, check it out.

855
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,320
Take care.

856
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,320
Yeah.

857
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,320
Thank you very much.

858
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
Good suggestion.

859
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
Chip Tatum.

860
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,320
I did Google the guy and looks like he was in the CIA.

861
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,320
Around the time my uncle was,

862
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,320
maybe a couple years later,

863
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,320
but also in some of the regions.

864
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,320
So I only heard this comment just before I started doing the show.

865
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,320
So I haven't dealt into it.

866
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,320
Just when I thought that I was done with all the conspiracy shit.

867
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,320
Now you give me another name to go and investigate.

868
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,320
Thanks.

869
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
But a good one.

870
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,320
It looks like the guy has some interesting stories about him.

871
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
So I'll definitely be on the lookout for that.

872
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,320
Here's something that's showed up.

873
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,320
This showed up yesterday.

874
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
For those of you who don't know,

875
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
I do a weekly show with John C. Devore,

876
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,320
I called no agenda,

877
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,320
which is exactly that.

878
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,320
The show has no agenda.

879
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,320
We just fire up the Skype,

880
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,320
fire up cast blasted record about

881
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,320
anywhere between 30 minutes in an hour of us just talking about stuff.

882
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,320
And it's caught on.

883
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,320
It really has.

884
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
People really are digging this show.

885
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
The numbers are just growing astronomically.

886
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,320
And yesterday,

887
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,320
I kind of equated to one of those 1960s answer records.

888
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,320
Where you know, you had Neil Sadaka did.

889
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
Oh, Carol.

890
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,320
And then I forget who it was who did a song called.

891
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,320
Oh, Neil.

892
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,320
You know, answer records.

893
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,320
Kind of like what Eminem did at one point.

894
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,320
And two savants who are definitely

895
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,320
members of the stable of savants here on the Charlie.

896
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,320
Namely, the candy man Luke from Nokia,

897
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,320
and our very own comic strip blogger have created a show

898
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,320
in response to no agenda called Yo Agenda.

899
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,320
And their first episode is episode number 11,

900
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
which I really didn't get it at first,

901
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,320
but then I understood,

902
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,320
essentially, Yo Agenda is a number 11 is in response

903
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,320
to no agenda number 11.

904
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,320
We've done 11 episodes so far.

905
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,320
And I just wanted you to hear a little bit of this show.

906
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,320
If it would be somebody else involved,

907
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,320
I was going to have some kind of...

908
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,320
There was this, I should have queued this up.

909
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,320
I'm sorry.

910
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
There was this, this is one piece where the,

911
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,320
you know, John and I were talking about the,

912
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
the no-row virus.

913
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
And the fact that I refused to puke,

914
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,320
I just haven't peaked in 30 years.

915
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,320
Let me just find this bit for you,

916
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,320
where they're talking about vomiting.

917
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,320
It's so funny.

918
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,320
There's nothing like a guy from Finland

919
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,320
and a Polish guy in Germany

920
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,320
talking about puking, hold on a sec.

921
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
Let me see.

922
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,320
I think that's around here.

923
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
I know exactly what to...

924
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,320
So you had a moustache nutty.

925
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,320
Yes, my old family was out with all my rods.

926
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,320
So here, here Lucas talking about his family

927
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,320
having the no-row virus as well.

928
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,320
It's just funny.

929
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,320
But I don't know for us,

930
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,320
it took only 24 hours.

931
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,320
And usually it takes only three to five days.

932
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,320
So I don't know what,

933
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,320
if Adam is really weak or what's happening to him,

934
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,320
but it sounds quite long.

935
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,320
Let's say more than seven days to be down with the no-row virus.

936
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,320
So probably has something to do with the fact that he doesn't puke.

937
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
So if you puke them,

938
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,320
you can read over it immediately.

939
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,320
And if you don't puke,

940
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,320
it kind of stays in your system.

941
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,320
So I think that generally puking and vomiting is a healthy,

942
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,320
because you throw away all the stuff in it,

943
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,320
because you can both sides.

944
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,320
You should try to puke and vomit through everything.

945
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,320
You should try to puke and vomit through everything.

946
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,320
Some fine advice there.

947
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,320
Please check out this show.

948
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,320
You will not be disappointed.

949
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,320
I put it in the Daily Source Code channel as well.

950
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,320
So you can pick up the latest episode.

951
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,320
You'll agenda.podshell.com.

952
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,320
Adam, it's Paul Durham from Black Lab.

953
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,320
You know, as the New Year begins,

954
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,320
I've been looking back at all this stuff we've done recently.

955
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,320
And it's hard to believe that it's been almost two years

956
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,320
since we first put see the sun up on the PMN.

957
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,320
Along with releasing two albums this year,

958
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,320
the highlight of 2007 was of course the roller coaster ride

959
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,320
that was bummerous to charts.

960
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,320
And the tremendous support we received from the New Media community.

961
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
We don't play live months these days,

962
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,320
but back in the summer of 2006,

963
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:27,320
we did play a special acoustic set in San Francisco live at Podshow HQ.

964
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:32,320
Until now, only a handful of crazy Podshow folks over there have heard it.

965
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,320
But as a token of our gratitude to all the podcasters

966
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,320
who've shown us their support over the last two years,

967
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,320
we here at Black Lab Central are releasing the show as an acoustic EP.

968
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:48,320
Available as a free MP3 download at blacklabworld.com slash podshow.

969
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,320
So come over and grab the exclusive live at Podshow EP

970
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
and check out our two new albums technology

971
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,320
and passion news a trace.

972
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,320
So thanks again, everyone.

973
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,320
And you know, I love you about a company.

974
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,320
Dance, you can feel fine.

975
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,320
You can dance a little twist.

976
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,320
You turn your pretty red head back.

977
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,320
You've got the eye access.

978
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,320
Can you see yourself in my better night?

979
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,320
Would you leave me at the side of the road?

980
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,320
Won't you walk right up to me?

981
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,320
Would you talk to me?

982
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,320
All right, yes.

983
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,320
Don't mind me.

984
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,320
More at it back.

985
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,320
Baby, back in your leaves.

986
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,320
You teach me how to fly.

987
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,320
You see, I'm scared to die.

988
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,320
Won't you just be gone too long?

989
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,320
Teach me how to fly.

990
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,320
Keep me up at night.

991
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,320
You'll be there all the world if I should.

992
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,320
For you.

993
00:45:52,320 --> 00:46:05,320
I feel like the spot is staying like a memory in my mind.

994
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,320
I feel like the morning fell like the bottom's falling out.

995
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:14,320
I can see what's up there all the way down in the valley below.

996
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,320
I can walk right up to you.

997
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,320
I can talk to you.

998
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,320
More at it back.

999
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,320
Baby, back in your leaves.

1000
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,320
Can you teach me how to fly?

1001
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,320
You see, I'm scared to die.

1002
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,320
Won't you just be gone too long?

1003
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,320
Teach me how to fly.

1004
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,320
Keep me up at night.

1005
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,320
You'll be there all the world if I should.

1006
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,320
You see, I'm scared to die.

1007
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,320
Won't you just be gone too long?

1008
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,320
Teach me how to fly.

1009
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,320
You see, I'm scared to die.

1010
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,320
Won't you just be gone too long?

1011
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,320
Teach me how to fly.

1012
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,320
You see, I'm scared to die.

1013
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,320
Won't you just be gone too long?

1014
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,320
Teach me how to fly.

1015
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,320
Keep me up at night.

1016
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:18,320
Won't you just be gone too long?

1017
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,320
Teach me how to fly.

1018
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,320
You see, I'm scared to die.

1019
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:28,320
Won't you just be gone too long?

1020
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,320
Teach me how to fly.

1021
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,320
Keep me up at night.

1022
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:38,320
You'll be there all the world if I should.

1023
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,320
Mostly you.

1024
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:47,320
Mostly you.

1025
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,320
There you go, that's how it's supposed to work.

1026
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,320
Black, hand it out the freebies.

1027
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,320
Learn the crawl.

1028
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,320
You can find it.

1029
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,320
I'll put the link in the show notes.

1030
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,320
Of course, there's lots of black, lavender, pod tape music.

1031
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,320
Now work as well.

1032
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,320
Before I go, I'll remind you of the voice.

1033
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,320
You become it.

1034
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:25,720
I'm thinking maybe I should, uh, while I'm at it, maybe I should, uh, give you the UK number

1035
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,760
as well because, uh, well, let's face it.

1036
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,760
I like hearing from my British friends.

1037
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,760
