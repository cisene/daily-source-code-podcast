00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
Hello Adam, this is Grandpa, no not your grandpa, but I may everybody's grandpa, maybe

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,000
two years old, my kids, kids call me grandpa, so I'm grandpa.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,480
Just want to say that I've never had a problem with prostate cancer, and I think you've

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,320
explained why with this whole rub one out for cancer.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,880
Thanks a lot of sense, and to you all this, who have a problem with you talking about it

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,600
because they want to put an image of you doing your business, maybe I can make them feel

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,600
a little better by thinking a grandpa at 82, rubber one out for kids, yeah, the thought of

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,120
Adam is so bad now, is it?

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,440
Think about it way, listen into the DSC, 769.

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,200
For $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, done the next generation radio

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,840
content in my years, I like to think I'm flying to the future.

12
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:34,840
Take a sad song and make it better, remember to let it reach your head, but you can start

13
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:50,840
doing it forever, hate you, don't make it better, take a sad song and make it better,

14
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:57,840
remember to let it reach your head, remember to let it reach your head, but you can start

15
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:12,640
doing it forever, hate you, don't make it better, take a sad song and make it better,

16
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:22,800
yeah, I love to let it reach your head, and make it better, take a sad song and make it better,

17
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,840
remember to let it reach your head, remember to let it reach your head, remember to let it reach your head,

18
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,840
We were made to go out and get out of it

19
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,840
We don't let you know, we don't let you know

20
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,840
We don't let you know, we don't let you know

21
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,840
We don't let you know, we don't let you know

22
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,840
We don't let you know

23
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,840
We don't let you know

24
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:12,840
We made to go out and get out of it

25
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,840
We don't let you know

26
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,840
We don't let you know

27
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,840
We don't let you know

28
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:53,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:08,160
no, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not, no, no,

30
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,160
Sounds a bit like a football anthem doesn't

31
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:18,560
I don't think it could be further from the truth mash up by DJ Moore and I believe I sourced that one from mash up town now come

32
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,160
Beatles versus Beck Jude is a loser baby, so why don't you kill you hey, everybody welcome to the Deadly source code episode number

33
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
769 coming to you from the

34
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,160
affluent subwoofer serino as as Gilford

35
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:38,120
Sorry about the footballer Friday. It got pretty footballer, but man, what a Friday. We had how we had the Lisbon treaty being voted

36
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:50,460
down by the Irish. We had the Netherlands kicking Francis ass in the European Cup finals. I mean, it was just it was just victory all around. It was fantastic. I loved it

37
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,460
I will say something funny happened to me on the way home

38
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,460
Friday as I was flying the Delta Sheriff back. Of course, I recorded the trip over

39
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:07,960
which was episode 767 or 760 I don't remember any more. As I was at the Rotterdam Jet Center, I noticed that

40
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,960
and I should have taken a picture. I can't believe them such a dick that I didn't. I

41
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,960
waxed it didn't just notice it was hard not to see that there was little old cute Delta

42
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Sheriff standing nose to nose with the royal jet, which I think it's like a 50 passenger deal. I mean, it's a it's a it's a real big plane

43
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,960
and had the opportunity to meet the prime minister of the Netherlands who was off with all of the

44
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:41,960
cabinet members. I was interested through the Dutch Foreign Affairs Secretary of State and it was pretty cool.

45
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,960
So who knows? Who knows? What kind of conversations we can have soon on the Charlie? Would that be funny if we had a young

46
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,960
painter Balkan and a prime minister of the Netherlands on? Well, it could happen because man, I tell you this this

47
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,960
Lisbon treaty. Well, we'll be talking about that later on today's program obviously, but first a couple of

48
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,960
responses to the sound seeing tour that I did with the November 277 Delta Sheriff going from

49
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,960
Fair Oaks here in the United Kingdom, not far from the affluent suburb of Surrey actually over to

50
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,960
Rotterdam and the Netherlands. Of course, I told you it's best to be enjoyed if you can put it on your car

51
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,960
stereo while you're driving around. In fact, even better if you have someone else driving and you can just close your eyes, but that of course is

52
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,960
you know, again, only if someone else is driving, right? November 277 Delta's Sierra

53
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,960
I'd like to congratulate you on your best at the so keep it coming. Absolutely love love love stuff and

54
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,960
the guy at the departure frequency is one two seven points for our good day.

55
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Why do you seven four good day? I love it when when airplane geeks fall down.

56
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:55,960
I don't this is Charlie Delphi Lima. Ah, Charlie Delphi Lima that would be Charles the drunken

57
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Londoner, of course. I've just been listening to the AC. I have no idea what it was, but I'm currently on the

58
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:11,960
out for 31. It sounds like a kill foot. The south of 31. I mean, I've heard this before.

59
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:21,960
I'm just listening to the AC that you put out of your flying to the Netherlands and I wanted the phone and say

60
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:28,960
how much I enjoy it, a flicking on found it. So I'm going to be down the road

61
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,960
way down the earth in three. It was just, I don't know, just navigating cars hearing the

62
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:44,960
trucks going over a single spot like, yeah, it's a big deal. Man, it's just really exciting driving

63
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:52,960
along. And I enjoy it. Thank you very much. So Bush has been coming on Sunday's tomorrow

64
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,960
that'll be at five spots. Yeah, right on. Charles, well, he enjoyed it. That's nice to know.

65
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,960
But a lot of noise there on the recording Charles and he didn't mention something about about Bush

66
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,960
coming to to London. And of course, he'd, I think it was Charles the drunken London who

67
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,960
phoned it and said, you know, we're going to have this going to be a protest. It starts at one

68
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,960
o'clock. And yes, there was a protest and not a lot of people showed up though about

69
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,960
2000, two and a half thousand people. And of which 25 got arrested and I saw some of the pictures

70
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,960
in some of the papers today. Man, look, like, oops, that's the lady Patricia's just brought me

71
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,960
shake, love her for that. And look like the cops were pretty damn aggressive, man.

72
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,960
And it's certainly that didn't get a lot of coverage. You know, the way we would have

73
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,960
hoped it would have, but, well, certainly support that. And if anyone was there and if

74
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,960
you had an issue with the protesting, I'd like to know why the cops started hammering

75
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,960
everybody and why they arrested people. What went wrong? I mean, couldn't this just be a

76
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,960
a com protest? Very interested to know. If you know, please give us a call on the

77
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,960
voice mail lines or drop me an MP3 if you don't mind.

78
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,960
Hello, Adam, I'm from Germany here. Just looking to see 76 data, I think it was

79
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:11,960
while hiking around here. Being a pilot myself, I really like the fact that you

80
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,960
brought tons of recall of the thing in the air. And this thing, Germany, flying

81
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,960
is still something that many people are afraid of or don't know how it works or

82
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,960
think it's only for the rich. Yeah.

83
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Hey, Marcus. These days, it is only for the rich, man. Holy crap. I can't believe

84
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,960
how much it's costing the flying now with a fuel price. I mean, no, no. I'm sure

85
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,960
I've once seen that going shut the F up. Who cares about your problems with flying?

86
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,960
You know, I've burned about 60 liters an hour. Of course, I get quite a

87
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,960
distance. You know, I go about 170 miles on that 60 liters.

88
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,960
But wow, it's become rather expensive. I think the most recent fuel

89
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,960
price I got with VAT, so that's all the tax putting was about one pound

90
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,960
60 per liter. You can only imagine how that shit starts to stack up

91
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,960
after a while. And I remember filling up the aircraft completely

92
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,960
full for under 300 pounds. Only, you know, I don't know, six months ago.

93
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,960
And now it seems like I can't get away for less than 500 if I

94
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,960
feel of a thousand dollars to fill up the plane. It's not really,

95
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,960
it's not really for everybody anymore.

96
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,960
In fact, it is for rich people.

97
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,960
I have to fight to the sometime because obviously I'm flying. I'm not rich.

98
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,960
I mean, I mean, beyond what you would consider.

99
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,960
So I really liked that I was thinking this morning about recording

100
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,960
a traffic pattern flying a motorglider and putting that out somewhere.

101
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,960
So people can better get it on the standing of what

102
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
needs to be done to fly such a plane.

103
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Yeah, you should do that, man. I'd be interested to hear that because

104
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
it's a hell of a lot quieter than my plane.

105
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Motorglider, all you might hear the put put put put or it could even

106
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,960
be even softer than that. And of course, really, I think it just

107
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,960
wins, shushing by. That should be cool, dude. You should do that.

108
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
Anyway, I think you could do that more often.

109
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,960
I think it's really interesting, especially if the weather is not so nice,

110
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,960
like the way you headed this time.

111
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Anyway, thanks. I think I'm supposed to say they work for us.

112
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
But yeah.

113
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
And they absolutely do.

114
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,960
One more about this before we move on to another topic.

115
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
What I'm doing, man.

116
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Fuckin' love that start to zero.

117
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
I don't see her. I don't see her.

118
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
I don't see her. I don't think that's not where I was fuckin' play it.

119
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
On the cast, out of where the base is.

120
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
I don't know.

121
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
I think I'll do it.

122
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Yeah, it's ready for us.

123
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
Oh, that's a good idea.

124
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Yeah, go name, thank you.

125
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Yeah, that's the way to play it, man.

126
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,960
Wait until I get better, and I get, you know,

127
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,960
like a turbine or a turbo prop or something like that.

128
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,960
You know, we'll just have a nice wine.

129
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
I can't wait.

130
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
That would be a WHINE, not WINE.

131
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,960
So of course, the Lisbon Treaty,

132
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:02,960
The Lisbon Treaty, holy moly, unbelievable what's going on here.

133
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Over the weekend, lots and lots of coverage, of course.

134
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,960
This is a huge deal for those of you who haven't been following along.

135
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Essentially, the Irish voted no to the Lisbon Treaty, which is a version

136
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,960
of a constitution for it, the European Union.

137
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Excuse me.

138
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,960
Oh, that really felt good.

139
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,960
The constitution isn't really the right word.

140
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Of course, the word constitution was scrapped from the Lisbon Treaty,

141
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,960
or really from the constitution to become the Lisbon Treaty.

142
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,960
It's like an legal document that talks about a lot of things in very complicated language,

143
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,960
not really telling you what the hell is going on.

144
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,960
But it will shift, I believe effectively, about 50% of all governmental powers

145
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,960
in each of the 27 member states, over to Brussels,

146
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
or alternatively, distractsburg.

147
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Remember, they have two seats of government and the alternate cities,

148
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
because I don't know.

149
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
Someone got pissed off and they had to do two.

150
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
It's like a childish baby thing.

151
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Anyway, so now ministers of the European Parliament,

152
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,960
foreign ministers are foreign affairs, they're saying,

153
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,960
you know, so this treaty can't be pushed through.

154
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,960
It can't go into effect unless all 27 member states ratified.

155
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Ireland now is said no way.

156
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
We don't want it, we're not going to ratify it.

157
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
So it shouldn't be happening.

158
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,960
And now there's all this like, well, how about two out of three?

159
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,960
You know, we could do another vote, or we could isolate Ireland.

160
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,960
I mean, it's driving me nuts.

161
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,960
It's like move on.

162
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,960
What you guys are going to do is just take a piece of paper,

163
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,960
and write down 20 points about what this document says.

164
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,960
In plain English, plain Jane, please.

165
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
Hey, you work for us, do some.

166
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
And then we can actually decide on the issues,

167
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,960
instead of trying to ramrod something through,

168
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
you know, 26 of the member states,

169
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
leaving only one hole open, oops, G.

170
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Do you think that if all countries that had a referendum,

171
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
we wouldn't have a lot more no votes, of course we would have.

172
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
Because people are suspicious.

173
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,960
They don't understand that they can't read these documents.

174
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
I tried.

175
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
It's complicated.

176
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
You can't get answers.

177
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
There's no FAQ.

178
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
There you go.

179
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
How about the FAQ treaty?

180
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,960
That would be something for you guys to look into.

181
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Hello, Mr. Curry.

182
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Still Sky, you determined you pulling in from Dublin, Ireland.

183
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm here, actually.

184
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,960
My second week at my new job, working for Google,

185
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
from hearing Dublin training, man.

186
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,960
No, that's the job you took for less money.

187
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Makes sense.

188
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
It's Google.

189
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
I hope you got some stock.

190
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Wow, man.

191
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
It's a great experience, great experience.

192
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,960
Hey, I actually really called in to say,

193
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,960
big thank you to Terry.

194
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,960
Terry, thank you for the great audio clip.

195
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Now, every-

196
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,960
Oh, this is Terry Little Red,

197
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,960
who sent in a sexy audio comment.

198
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,960
I believe that was to help out with the prostate cancer prevention

199
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
Quote.

200
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Time to work on my prostate prevention quota.

201
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,960
I got your beautiful voice in my mind,

202
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
and I don't have ugly queries.

203
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Bounding through my brain.

204
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
It's very, very nice.

205
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
You're very nice.

206
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
I really appreciate the gesture.

207
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,960
There's one problem though.

208
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
I still have visuals of Curry.

209
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Maybe if you shoot me like some make-up pictures,

210
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,960
you know, eliminate that problem as well.

211
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Terry, thank you very much.

212
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Look forward to seeing those pictures.

213
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
Check out my blog, people.

214
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,960
The J-Node.logspot.com.

215
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,960
T-H-E-J-N-O-T-E.

216
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Docs, Docs, Docs, Docs, Docs, Docs, Docs, C-A.

217
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
Bye-bye.

218
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
All right, sales guy.

219
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
I thought he was going to be in Ireland

220
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,960
about the treaty.

221
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Clearly, I was wrong there.

222
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,960
Somehow, the masturbation always seems to creep into the show

223
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,960
at one point or the other.

224
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
I had a big spread of Jones.

225
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,960
You'll probably get this in in different ways.

226
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,960
But according to Aunt A, the Irish State Bullcaster,

227
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,960
the good people in the Republic of Ireland have voted

228
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
no to the list been treaty.

229
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Yeah?

230
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Good one.

231
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,960
Yeah.

232
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,960
I got thousands of messages, emails, text messages.

233
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,960
And of course, it happened when I was actually flying back.

234
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,960
So the minute I got in the car at the airfield,

235
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,960
here at Ferrox, I turned on the radio.

236
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
And I was like, boom.

237
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,960
By the way, I really liked the BBC World Service.

238
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,960
Man, it is really superior to a lot of just the newsbotons

239
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,960
in general, of course, on regular radio 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

240
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Well, the radio 5 does go in a radio 4 goes into depth

241
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,960
into a lot of topics, which is nice.

242
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,960
But the world service, the quality of course is shit

243
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
because it's a medium wave.

244
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,960
But then again, it's almost like listen to a really bad MV

245
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
three-file.

246
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Oops.

247
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
I didn't want to play that one.

248
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Here's what I wanted.

249
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
Come extra.

250
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Come extra.

251
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Come extra.

252
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
Come extra.

253
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Come extra.

254
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Come extra.

255
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Come extra.

256
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Come extra.

257
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Come extra.

258
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Come extra.

259
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Come extra.

260
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Come extra.

261
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
What do you think?

262
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Will it be about Ireland?

263
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
One can only guess.

264
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Hello.

265
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
Adam.

266
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
That's where you present your carry.

267
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,960
So, in the year 2004, Big Bang EU Entertainment took place,

268
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,960
and old EU members thought that new EU members

269
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
will hinder the development of EU.

270
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,960
But the contrary is through Polish immigrants

271
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,960
have extremely high work ethic.

272
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,960
No lesser than Koreans and Japanese,

273
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,960
and the Czech beers are the best in the world.

274
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,960
And the Kritek Estonia has created

275
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,960
a software that you, Adam, carry, and your Uncle Dvorak.

276
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Use every week Skype.

277
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Skype.

278
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
Yes.

279
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,960
Recently, the old EU members,

280
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Netherlands and Friends have rejected new EU constitution,

281
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,960
and last week also Ireland

282
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,960
that would be the third word country

283
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,960
without many, many billions of subsidies from EU.

284
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
It does.

285
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Well, let me finish one.

286
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Has rejected EU treaty.

287
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,960
Biting the hand that was feeding it.

288
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,960
You know, doesn't that say something there?

289
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Comments your blogger?

290
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
I mean, doesn't that?

291
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
Is that exactly the way it should be?

292
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,960
That they said despite that they're getting a billion euros a year

293
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
from the European Union.

294
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
They're still saying, hey, hold on a second.

295
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
You know, we don't like this.

296
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Obviously, people would know that they're putting that at risk.

297
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Again, I think it's just because they don't understand

298
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
what's being said.

299
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,960
And, you know, and ministers of European Parliament have

300
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
copped to this.

301
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
I said, yeah, yeah, that's true.

302
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
We really should do a bit of job.

303
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Well, now's your chance.

304
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
Now, you guys going to go to it.

305
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,960
You put up a website with 20 or 40 points and say,

306
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,960
this is what this thing is about, and here's what

307
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
each issue is.

308
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
It's that simple people.

309
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,960
Without which, the new EU treaty,

310
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,960
without which the economy of EU will be damaged,

311
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,960
because in fact, EU will not be able to work smoothly.

312
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
I see, I don't know, I just don't agree.

313
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,960
I think the EU so far is working fantastically.

314
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,960
At least, at the surface level,

315
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960
it seems like a lot of things are going well.

316
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,960
No matter what this document says,

317
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,960
it'll take years and years to implement everything

318
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,960
and smooth over whatever bumps are bound to be in the road.

319
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
But what is it?

320
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
What will make it run smoother?

321
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
What will make it run smoother than it is right now?

322
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,960
Please, someone explain what the treaty says.

323
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,960
And the comic strip blogger,

324
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,960
since you know it's a well, give me the 10 or 20 points

325
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
that are listed in this treaty.

326
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
You're the EU specialist.

327
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
Go down the list.

328
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
It's 269 pages.

329
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
It weighs 11 pounds when printed out.

330
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Please tell me what it says.

331
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,960
You're going to be able to face globalization.

332
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,960
Nobody wants real globalization, man.

333
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Because that means there's a new world order.

334
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Wake up, CSB.

335
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Well, I will continue to like Irish people anyway.

336
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,960
And I will not stop buying Q&A and Guinness,

337
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,960
but now we only need to rethink future of European Union.

338
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Europe.

339
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Hmm.

340
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Well, I don't see there's a problem with the future of the European Union.

341
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
First of all, we've got the same money,

342
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,960
which is a good start, at least most of us, too.

343
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
With the euro.

344
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
It's a strong currency.

345
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
We have a great time with playing football against each other.

346
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,960
That seems to be working out fine.

347
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,960
You know, you have this downers like the Eurovision Song Contest.

348
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,960
But in general, I think we all like each other.

349
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
We get along.

350
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
We work with each other's countries.

351
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
What do we need to do?

352
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
What do we need to shore up here?

353
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,960
What are the things that and what benefit will it be to the citizens of the European Union?

354
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
That's what I want to know.

355
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
Just make it simple and tell me.

356
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,960
And I bet you that people, if they see the benefit, they'll vote for it.

357
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
It's that simple.

358
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
Hey, Adam.

359
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,960
It's a topic right here.

360
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
And this is not about new currency.

361
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
No.

362
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,960
Hey, I just picked up my Saturday edition of the Wall Street Journal.

363
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Top headline.

364
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,960
Europe and turmoil after Irish vote.

365
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,960
Apparently, the Irish have rejected the Lisbon Treaty by 53 to 47 percent.

366
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
Yep.

367
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
What do you go at them?

368
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,960
They work for us.

369
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
It's not like I had anything to do with it.

370
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,960
But if I change just one person's mind, then I'm very proud of that.

371
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,960
Actually, I got an email that I want to share with you.

372
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,960
This came in today.

373
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,960
From I think it's Daniel.

374
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
Hi, Adam.

375
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Yeah.

376
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
My name's Dan.

377
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
I'm one of your few underage listeners.

378
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,960
Just wanted to say I really appreciate all you do for us.

379
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Can't wait to listen to your show when I get home from school.

380
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
I agree.

381
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,960
Mainstream media is just drugs for your brain.

382
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
That's why I listened to the DSC.

383
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Also, I'm thinking about buying the new iPhone 3G when it comes out.

384
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
It'll be nice to know what you think about it.

385
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,960
If it's mail, 16, live an upstate New York student.

386
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Love, you know, homo, great hair.

387
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Hope you win.

388
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Remember they should work for us.

389
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Hey, Dan.

390
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Well, I'm going to get one.

391
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,960
I think that comes out on July 11.

392
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,960
I'm going to get a UK one because I really need a good UK number.

393
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,960
And besides, I think that deals probably better with the UK version.

394
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,960
And I'll let you know how it goes.

395
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,960
I'm sure that dropping in the toy that will still be a no-no.

396
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,960
But otherwise, I think it's as we say here.

397
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,960
It's taken off all of the boxes.

398
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,960
Jesus.

399
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
Jesus.

400
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,960
Put back.

401
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
Hi, Adam.

402
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
It's Matt from Gamesweasel.

403
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,960
On this week's show, I review Rates driver grid on the Xbox 360.

404
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Also play Lego Indiana Jones on the DS.

405
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,960
And you can win copies of a loan in the dark for the Xbox 360.

406
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
That's all the gamesweasel.com.

407
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Yeah, just wanted to remind you that we had this new product, new sponsor of the Charlie.

408
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,960
And for those of you who use hard drives, external hard drives, like a USB or a fire wire drive,

409
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,960
for big media files.

410
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,960
And I have mine on order because boy, do I need this device.

411
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
And I know other people that I know people do use a lot of Photoshop files.

412
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,960
These are gigabyte files.

413
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,960
And man, when you look at the archiving process that I have to go through on this show,

414
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
I'm going to let me take a look.

415
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Excuse me.

416
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
Oh boy.

417
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Nice shake.

418
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Let's see how my MacBook Pro, which, of course, I'm using to record the show.

419
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,960
I now have 57 gigs available of a total 148 gigs.

420
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
You know, that's not going to last me all that much longer.

421
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
I've only had this thing for, what is it?

422
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
Nine, ten months, something like that.

423
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,960
Now, I use an external USB, so USB drive.

424
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,960
It's one of the, you know, like a let's see, which I'm not, I'm not too keen on let's see actually.

425
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,960
I use that for backup with time machine.

426
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,960
But really, I just like to have one drive that can store all of the source code files,

427
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,960
which is just a lot, you know, concerning all the source material.

428
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,960
And then, of course, the, the actual renderings, and then there's the project files.

429
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,960
And they'll, and believe me, not a lot of work goes into this.

430
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,960
And so this Drobot is essentially, it's an external drive that, it works a bit like a raid

431
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,960
where it's fail safe, but it grows as you grow.

432
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Oh, yeah, it just keeps on growing, baby.

433
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,960
And the way it works, I can't wait to get it.

434
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
The way it works is, you put in a drive.

435
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,960
I think it's like almost like a regular ATA based, you know, like a western digital.

436
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
You see, I'm just a raw drive.

437
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
You slide it into a slot.

438
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,960
Yeah, that's like your one terabyte or two derabytes.

439
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
You even have four terabyte versions.

440
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,960
And, you know, then if you need more space, you can just pop in a new one.

441
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,960
You can keep popping them in.

442
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
You can actually upgrade them.

443
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,960
So if you had, you know, let's say four one terabyte drives.

444
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,960
You could take one out, put it in a four terabyte, you know, put it in a four terabyte drive,

445
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
without, you know, losing your data.

446
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,960
You can even do it on the fly, hot swappable.

447
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
It's really outrageous.

448
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,960
It costs $499.

449
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,960
There's a bundle they have now.

450
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,960
Actually, so it's safe.

451
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,960
You want to buy the regular unit, the Drobot basic.

452
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,960
It's $50 off if you use the code DSC, obviously, for daily source code.

453
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,960
Then they have the bundle, which is the Drobot unit with a western digital green power,

454
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,960
one terabyte hard drive or a two terabyte or four terabyte.

455
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,960
Actually, only last till June 30, you see, you have to hurry up on that one.

456
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Also, $50 off.

457
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,960
Use the code DSC, go to DrobotStore.com.

458
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,960
And now, let's try and solve the hit test.

459
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
The hit test.

460
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,960
I'm counting casting.

461
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,960
I'm going to miss this, you see?

462
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
Hit test.

463
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
Hit it test.

464
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
Young boldness.

465
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Hey, Adam, it's time for the hit test again.

466
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
And this is intro number one.

467
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Straight to it.

468
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Please, y'all.

469
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,960
It's in a one of these starting something.

470
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
Got to be starting something.

471
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
No, it's Michael Jackson.

472
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Number two.

473
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,960
I'm sure it's like earth wind and fire or something like that.

474
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
I don't know the song.

475
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Earth wind and fire.

476
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
And number three.

477
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:21,960
Don't push me because I'm close to the edge premise to flash with the message.

478
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Yon, making it easy on me today.

479
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,960
And these are the answers.

480
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,960
The hit test.

481
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,960
From 1979, answer number one.

482
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,960
This is Michael Jackson.

483
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,960
Love me.

484
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Did I see you?

485
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Can I say one of these starting something?

486
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
Because that was wrong.

487
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
Obviously it's don't stop.

488
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Don't stop to get enough Michael Jackson's answer number one.

489
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,960
And this is answer number two.

490
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,960
From 1980, earth wind and fire.

491
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
I still don't recognize the song.

492
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,960
I can't let go of earth wind and fire is answer number two.

493
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,960
And this is answer number three.

494
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
From glass everywhere.

495
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,960
People pissin' on the fidget no to just don't care.

496
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
I can't taste mouth.

497
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Can't take the noise.

498
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Got no money to move on.

499
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
I guess I got no choice.

500
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,960
Don't push me because I'm close to the edge.

501
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,960
It's I'm trying not to lose my head.

502
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
It's like a joke with some times.

503
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,960
It makes me wonder how I keep going under.

504
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,960
It's like a joke with some times.

505
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,960
It makes me wonder how I keep going under.

506
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,960
From 1983, Graham has the flesh and the fury is five and the message.

507
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,960
And that concludes here's number 126.

508
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,960
So Adam, how did you do this for you?

509
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Well, I think in my haste I messed it up on Michael Jackson,

510
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,960
but I'll say two out of three then just to make it fair.

511
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,960
Like always, hitters.mefio.com is the place to find the answers to this and any other hitters.

512
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,960
And also the links to why two, so you can buy the tracks featured in the hitters online.

513
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,960
Thank you for playing Adam.

514
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Thank you.

515
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
Thank you for listening.

516
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,960
Next week I'll be back for another hitters.

517
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,960
So until then, have fun.

518
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Take care.

519
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
And remember to try to think with your hearts.

520
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
Bye-bye.

521
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960

And he is a complete virtuoso.

529
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,960
His name's Welp Rivera.

530
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Influenced by the heaviest rock bands in the world.

531
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
He takes it to the classical tip.

532
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Orchestrated for the Charlie.

533
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,960
This is Tears.

Oh, damn.

675
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
Well, Roberto.

676
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,960
You know, that's coming out of a computer or synthesizer.

677
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
Man, it just blows me away.

678
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
What is doing the orchestration is awesome.

679
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
It sounds authentic.

680
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,960
It doesn't sound like like meaty or anything.

681
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
It's just awesome.

682
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
Fantastic.

683
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,960
I could listen to that.

684
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,960
When you crank that up on a pair of really good speakers,

685
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,960
it will freak you out.

686
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
I guarantee.

687
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
Adam, it's sweet from the Bay Area.

688
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,960
So we're just doing some thinking.

689
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,960
You know, we've been talking about dual clear energy for a while here.

690
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,960
And I haven't open minded.

691
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,960
But something's caught in my mind that.

692
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,960
I don't think we've talked about.

693
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
And that's it.

694
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,960
We've got a couple of nuclear power plants that are active in the Bay Area.

695
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
One's on East Bay.

696
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,960
And if you press another one and there's definitely one on the central valley.

697
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
Rancho is big.

698
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
And just after 9.11.

699
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
The press jump over on A.

700
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,960
You know, these things are protected.

701
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
And the turn is fixed target.

702
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,960
It's probably going to be the nuclear power plants because they can create.

703
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,960
You know, a strong nuclear blast out of these things.

704
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
By doing X, Y, or Z.

705
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
And we're in danger.

706
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,960
And we've got to get the protected.

707
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,960
And of course, they've never been protected.

708
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
Now, I know.

709
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
Atomic Rod Adams.

710
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
He has jumping out of his feet right now.

711
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,960
If you're seeing the play this on the show.

712
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
I want to know why that's not true.

713
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,960
I want to hear the atomic rod explain to me that it's not.

714
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,960
If that fear was overblown.

715
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
But better yet.

716
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,960
I want to know why.

717
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
I want to know a little bit of detail.

718
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Why is that not true?

719
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
What has changed?

720
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,960
Why is that?

721
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Why isn't it clear?

722
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Power plant is not as dangerous as they used to be.

723
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,960
I haven't read a lot of detail.

724
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,960
It's true somewhere out of the load to hear that.

725
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,960
Yeah.

726
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
You know.

727
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
Yeah, they were crushed.

728
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
What's that?

729
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
What's going on?

730
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,960
Hold on.

731
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
Oh, no.

732
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,960
This is weird.

733
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,960
Something's happening here.

734
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,960
I'm not quite sure.

735
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,960
Where's this coming from?

736
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
Do you guys hear that?

737
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,960
This is freaking me out.

738
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
Hold on.

739
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
I don't know if you can hear this.

740
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,960
But wait.

741
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
Let me.

742
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Maybe if I get rid of this.

743
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,960
Well, that's stop.

744
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
Yeah.

745
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,960
You guys didn't even hear that.

746
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,960
Did you?

747
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Yeah.

748
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Oh, crap.

749
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
I'm sorry about that.

750
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
Okay.

751
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
I don't.

752
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,960
For a second there, I considered editing that out because you couldn't hear what was going on

753
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,960
because I hit a web page and it just like freaked out on me.

754
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
So forget about it.

755
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,960
I won't do that.

756
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
Yeah.

757
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
Very interesting.

758
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,960
And of course, completely in line with what atomic rot has always been saying,

759
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,960
that, you know, this is like all perception.

760
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,960
So what you're saying is after 9-11,

761
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,960
people were talking about the vulnerability of nuclear power stations

762
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
in San Francisco and the Bay Area.

763
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,960
And nothing has been done to protect them from any type of terrorist attack.

764
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,960
And of course, there's lots of nuclear moon juice factories around the United States

765
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,960
and around the globe.

766
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
So atomic rot.

767
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,960
That is a great question for you, my friend.

768
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,960
You know, I got to get raw to jingle man.

769
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
He deserves it by now.

770
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
That's for sure.

771
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,960
Looking forward to that answer.

772
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
And also, did you hear about this other?

773
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,960
This was great.

774
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
This has been circling around the net.

775
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,960
See, where does this article come from?

776
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,960
Times online.

777
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,960
Apparently, a scientist who I think is operating

778
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,960
in the Bay Area.

779
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
Yes.

780
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
See, the company is called LS9.

781
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Has developed a DNA modified bug in insect

782
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,960
that when he eats like wood chips,

783
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,960
he actually poops out oil.

784
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,960
Crude oil.

785
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,960
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

786
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
It's too funny.

787
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,960
And so now, of course, they have to see if they can make this bug poop on scale.

788
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,960
But, oh, my gosh, can you just imagine the branding we can come up with for that?

789
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,960
Oh, that's beautiful.

790
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
Yeah, LS9.

791
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
Lemus here and nine.

792
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
You've got to check this out.

793
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
I'm sure they have a website somewhere.

794
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,960
I can't find it.

795
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,960
But anyway, if the story goes,

796
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,960
the scale is really the big problem right now.

797
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,960
If they wanted to produce enough oil for the United States to use on a daily basis,

798
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,960
they basically would have to have a plant.

799
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,960
For growing these DNA modified bugs,

800
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,960
you know, the size of like a higher or something like that.

801
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,960
So that may be a non-starter, but still very, very interesting.

802
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
Let me see.

803
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,960
I got to wrap this up.

804
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,960
I got like a conference call coming up and all kinds of stuff going on.

805
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
Of course tomorrow.

806
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
I think let me just check the calendar tomorrow.

807
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,960
I'm home as well.

808
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,960
Tomorrow is even a slower day.

809
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,960
So the storm, I don't want to promise anything.

810
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,960
But I'm definitely trying to get a couple of charities out.

811
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,960
Because I know we're on to a couple of topics here that are just going on fire.

812
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,960
And we've got to keep tracking this Lisbon treaty.

813
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,960
Because who knows what they're going to try and pull on us?

814
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,960
You know, those guys that work for us.

815
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:32,960
So now we've, see, we heard from Charles of Drunken London at the beginning of the show.

816
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
And this, you'll probably like this.

817
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,960
Because I have three, three voice messages from him.

818
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
So the first one you heard.

819
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
Now check this one out.

820
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,960
As goals, I'm home in London.

821
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
You know, I am, you know.

822
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

823
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
I know who you are.

824
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
Well, I'm there to meet today.

825
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,960
I'm hanging out with her for the day.

826
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:58,960
And she said to me, you can't be a prime minister if you're Jewish.

827
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,960
And I said, what?

828
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
What?

829
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,960
She said, well, this really had to convert to church Winkland.

830
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:15,960
So I know you're sort of American Dutch and now an Englishman.

831
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
But do you have to be?

832
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,960
I think Charles is already living up to his name on this one folks.

833
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
He's Anglican.

834
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
To be the prime minister of England.

835
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
Is it?

836
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,960
I mean, is it?

837
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
Is it?

838
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,960
Yeah, like you report into the head of being this church.

839
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,960
Yeah, it's just being clean, right?

840
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,960
Yes.

841
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,960
It has the English church.

842
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,960
Whatever the fuck that means.

843
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,960
Is that the way it is?

844
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,960
Is that, is that?

845
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,960
You know, Charles, that's a really good question, man.

846
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,960
I had no idea.

847
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,960
So if you want to be prime minister, you have to be a member of the Church of England.

848
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
And if you are of a different faith, you have to convert.

849
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,960
I don't know if that's true.

850
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,960
You know, England doesn't actually have a constitution as far as I know.

851
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,960
But as they refer to the Magna Carta a lot.

852
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,960
And I know I know how to pronounce it, but I'm sorry.

853
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,960
I don't actually know a lot about the history of the Magna Carta.

854
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
I have seen it with my own eyes and the museum.

855
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,960
I'll have to look that up and see what's going on with it.

856
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,960
What?

857
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
What?

858
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,960
Yeah.

859
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,960
Is anyone out there can explain that?

860
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:30,960
And also, could maybe your sister, he's got a cool name.

861
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,960
Something might blossom.

862
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
Willow.

863
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,960
Hello.

864
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
Hello.

865
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,960
A little bit about this Roman...

866
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
What's the word?

867
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,960
There.

868
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,960
That's just been elected as sort of Neo-Nazi reform Neo-Nazi.

869
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,960
But he says he's going to kick all the Romanian down.

870
00:39:49,960 --> 00:40:00,960
And supposedly his police forces are already burning down the houses of Romanian chipsies

871
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
in Rome.

872
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,960
Yeah, comics are blogger mentioned something about this maybe last week, about two weeks ago.

873
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,960
About this guy who's like, I don't know about burning down the houses, but yeah, I'm sure

874
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,960
Willow will be more than delighted to check in with the report.

875
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,960
Oh, yeah.

876
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,960
I've got a rambling.

877
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Yes, you have my friend.

878
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,960
You go swim, but ready to pop it.

879
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
Dude.

880
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,960
You're too funny man.

881
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
I love it when you call it.

882
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,960
He has one more that he's so plastered.

883
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,960
He's so hammered.

884
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,960
And it's the funniest one yet.

885
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
You know what I'm going to do?

886
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,960
I'm going to save that one until tomorrow.

887
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,960
Adam, hey, Friday 76 daily source code.

888
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,960
Excellent.

889
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,960
Excellent.

890
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Thank you so much.

891
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
It was fantastic.

892
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,960
And one more thing.

893
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,960
You know, there's two people.

894
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Doers and talkers.

895
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,960
Thanks for inspiring.

896
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,960
And it's just a handful of us that talk.

897
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,960
Dude, we could change the world.

898
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
I really believe that.

899
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,960
So to all the viewers out there, thank you.

900
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,960
Thank you.

901
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,960
I'm already to be a one of them.

902
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,960
And I really appreciate the ESC.

903
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,960
It's part of my life.

904
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Thank you, Adam.

905
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,960
All the best.

906
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
And you're absolutely right.

907
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
They work for us.

908
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,960
I know a girl.

909
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,960
She puts the color inside of my way.

910
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,960
But she's just like a maze.

911
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
We're all over the world.

912
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,960
I'll continue to change.

913
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,960
And I don't know like it.

914
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:48,960
To stand on the steps with my heart and my head.

915
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,960
And now I'm just starting to see.

916
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:01,960
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me.

917
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,960
So people need to call for a chance.

918
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,960
So people need to just wanna be.

919
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,960
So people need to call for a chance.

920
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,960
So people need to just play the game.

921
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,960
So people need to just play the game.

922
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,960
So people need to just play the game.

923
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,960
So people need to just play the game.

924
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:46,960
So people need to just play the game.

925
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,960
So people need to just play the game.

926
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,960
So people need to just play the game.

927
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,960
So people need to just play the game.

928
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,960
So people need to just play the game.

929
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,960
So people need to just play the game.

930
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,960
So people need to just play the game.

931
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:21,960
So people need to just play the game.

932
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,760
So people need to just play the game.

933
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,960
So people need to just play the game.

934
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:43,960
Oh, you see that skin, it's the same, she's been stale in there

935
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:51,960
Since the day she saw him walking away, now she lives

936
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,960
Clean it up and mess it me

937
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,960
Some people said, oh, I'll take

938
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,960
I miss this poor man like y'all

939
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,960
Some people think we know the truth

940
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,960
That's the truth, that's the truth

941
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,960
That's the only way to pull you away

942
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,960
And be the world on the silver bed

943
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,960
And what would it be?

944
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,960
We know when to share

945
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,960
But no one who truly cares for me

946
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,960
Some people want it all

947
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,960
But I don't want nothing at all

948
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,960
If you're a new baby

949
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,960
If I ain't got a new baby

950
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,960
Some people want it all

951
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,960
But I don't want nothing at all

952
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,960
But I don't want nothing at all

953
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,960
If I ain't got a new you, you, you, you

954
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,960
So far there's bigger to your darkness

955
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,960
The darkness will let you turn

956
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,960
Because we can't love it

957
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,960
We turn into lovers

958
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,960
So much bigger to your darkness

959
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,960
Still, as you can bring

960
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,960
You find out how much they can take

961
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,960
Those will be strong

962
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,960
And those souls are out

963
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,960
Those will be calm with our warmth

964
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,960
And what about you?

965
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,960
Can't hide me

966
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:09,960
So far there's bigger to your darkness

967
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,960
The darkness will let you turn

968
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,960
Because we can't find out how much they can take

969
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,960
So far, let's begin to your darkness

970
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,960
The darkness will have a lack of time

971
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,960
Because they come and love us and turn into my lives

972
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,960
So far, let's begin to your darkness

973
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,960
So far, let's begin to your darkness

974
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,960
So far, let's begin to your darkness

975
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,960
The mash of this world of course was especially for fathers day

976
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,960
For all the fathers out there

977
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,960
I did definitely source this one a mash up town.com

978
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,960
Dr. Art really hit home with that one mash of those two songs

979
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,960
Well he didn't do it but posting that one with us two songs mashed together

980
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,960
Particularly if you've got a daughter then

981
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,960
Well you can know how I feel right now

982
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,960
If you feel the same with you have a daughter or a son

983
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,960
Or if you're a daughter or a son

984
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,960
Which I guess we all are in one way or another

985
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,960
