00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,600
I'm coming home to reach this country, my territory, away from the soul, the Apache, the

2
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,680
The command sheet, the Rappelhole, the Navajo Terrorist, we talk Africans from their country to

3
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:41,280
build our way of ease and catch them in sleep and living in fear. Terrorism, we found a grenade

4
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,560
and killed innocence of veyens, babies, non military personnel, we found the Black civilian community

5
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,400
of Panama, with stealth bombers and killed unarmed teenagers and toddlers, pregnant mothers

6
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,720
and hardworking fathers, we found codophies home and killed his child, we found the Rappelhole,

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,080
we killed unarmed civilians, trying to make a living, we found a grenade and stood in, to pay back

8
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,200
for the attack, for an innocent kill, hundreds of hearts, working people, mothers and fathers,

9
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,400
who left room to go that day, not knowing that they'd never get back home, we found a Russia,

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,320
we found a Russia, and we found a far more than the thousands in New York and printed on it,

11
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,560
and we never found it in it.

12
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,960
He's crying in the playground, I was picking up children, I just couldn't go so far,

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,080
he was not soldiers, people just trying to make a day by day, we have support and sleep,

14
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,800
terrorism against the Palestinians, and Black South Americans, and now we are in danger.

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,360
Because it's tough, we have never seen it, and now we're all pregnant back into our home,

16
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:58,720
right now, America's security is coming home, Delta shared Charlie,

17
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,600
7-8-0, $16 billion worth of airplane strapped to my ass,

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,400

45
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,760
down to city hall we got married actually had the car uh commune car I believe it was uh sedan

46
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,160
a circle the block while we're getting married and uh we drank the champagne in the car before

47
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,880
we even back at our 56th street uh 42nd floor apartment the beginning of uh quite an adventure

48
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,160
and it has not stopped and by the way all that seems a little literally just like yesterday um

49
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,200
and the nicest thing today was this beautiful car that we got from uh from Christina

50
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,720
who uh by the way is turning 18 and in 20 days 22 days oh where's the time going and there's so

51
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,680
much to do and I'm just finally waking up myself and figuring out what's going on and feeling

52
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:37,200
great every single day so before I forget I love you lady Patricia uh today's uh program is entirely

53
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:43,440
sourced from the uh from the drop drop dot io slash daily source code uh which uh as you know

54
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,040
has now been disconnected from Twitter updates sorry about that minor snafu talked about it

55
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,600
I know agenda with John C to Warack over the weekend on the on the Saturday show a number 40 check

56
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,880
that out if you want to hear all kinds of uh uh cookie stuff that we talked about over the weekend

57
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,720
today though um as I said everything source from the drop uh except for the uh a couple of voicemail

58
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,760
calls and actually now I think about it you know you actually can leave voicemails on the on the drop

59
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,600
as well and and I'm I'm just loving this thing I'm using it as a as a as a complete uh really as a source

60
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,640
for almost everything you guys send so much cool stuff and it's neatly organized in blog format

61
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,720
like that is a real way to you know it's better than tagging it's uh it has easy download links and

62
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,960
if you actually use the number then I wouldn't you have to go anywhere else to check out the uh the

63
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,840
voicemails and then everyone have a record of the voicemail that you sent in uh which is great in

64
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:42,000
case I don't use it on the air which obviously happens because there's just not enough time in the

65
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,400
universe to play all the comments uh if you want to take a note of it here's the number and I'll put

66
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,200
it into the show notes for the data source code drop uh plus one this is what we want to put

67
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:58,160
into your cell phone so it works from anywhere in the world plus one six four six four nine five

68
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,160
nine two zero three now here's the bummer part and this is why no one will ever use it you

69
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,360
have to use a pin code to actually get through which is two triple zero six which is really easy

70
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,160
to remember because it's kind of two you got three zero's two times three is six two triple zero six

71
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:24,000
and I thought so and I was entering the studio complex uh let me see a couple of uh interesting

72
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,120
little bits of news that I wanted to share we do this one actually from uh just the other day

73
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,800
the Royal Bank of Scotland even thought the credit crisis was bad well it's uh it's definitely

74
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,920
causing shock waves over it and notice the word shock shock waves over here the Royal Bank of

75
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,120
Scotland which actually happened to count with the Royal Bank of Scotland this has less to do with

76
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,680
the count holders at least until they run out of money or out of deposits um and this is more about

77
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,240
shareholders uh but to unveil the biggest loss in UK banking history after taking a hit already

78
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,200
of almost six billion pounds from the quote credit crisis not even calling it subprime anymore

79
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,240
that would be twelve billion dollars Britain's second largest bank is this week expected to

80
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,800
reveal a pre-tax loss of at least one billion for the first six months of the year with analyst

81
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:20,240
warning it could slide to as much as 1.7 billion in the red holy creaky crepola that's a lot of

82
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,400
money and uh I don't think it's over everybody I see was in the financial sector talking about

83
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,720
you know the state of where we're at is just like freaking out let me check oil for a second

84
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,920
because uh the drops below a hundred and uh uh hundred and twenty oh interesting it's a hundred and

85
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,920
nineteen and that's today uh Tuesday August 5th though who knows it's all over the map no one really

86
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,520
knows what the hell is going on but one things for sure the banks are running out of money and I'm

87
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:53,200
trying to come up with a really easy way to explain how money works and particularly this business of

88
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,320
uh fractional banking fractional reserve banking where essentially if you give me if I if I

89
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,680
'm a banking you give me ten bucks but I can then go ahead and I can use that ten bucks nine more

90
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,720
times in addition to the one I'm already holding as long as I hold that one and lend that money out

91
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:16,800
that's one part the real uh part is the uh is the interest and here's just here's a little bit of

92
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,840
brain work I want you to give yourself okay if there's a there's a known quantity of money in

93
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:28,320
circulation right if it's phantom if it's paper it doesn't matter let's just say there's a hundred

94
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,480
some things what kind of hundred trillion doesn't matter just a hundred if of that one hundred

95
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,680
half of it is lent lent out to people so they you know borrowed that to buy houses and cars

96
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:51,040
kitchens and go on vacation you know pay for college pay additional medical bills if a half

97
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,680
of that hundred fifty is lent out at interest that means that there's more money has to come back

98
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,640
than is actually in circulation so where does the money come from the money can only come from other

99
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,520
people within that system and that's the people who fall off the edge you know your house is

100
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,680
foreclosed on they take your car away uh you fail to repay your student loan and get all kinds

101
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:22,320
of other crap coming down the pie catch you when you fail that's when uh that money is taken away

102
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,280
from you or that that value and then it's distributed usually back to the bank so I'm trying to find

103
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,440
an easy way to explain that so because we really have to understand what the hell is going on

104
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,600
with our money because that's where the inscrute and and of course money is in in general the root of

105
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,440
all evil also want to bring your attention to i'm pretty sure that in the in geeky circles this

106
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,880
story has been circulating Gary McKinnon this is the kid literally i have to say kid he's um

107
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,960
i don't know he's like he's like he's about uh late twenties maybe early thirties now but in

108
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:01,520
2000 uh 2001 he had watched the disclosure project which we talked about here on the daily source code which

109
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:09,200
was released in 2001 where you had a whole bunch of uh officials from inside the air force and

110
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,840
other governmental agencies including NASA saying you know UFOs exist we've had contact with them

111
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,720
and i'm willing to testify before congress so this guy who basically is the has the equivalent

112
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,360
hacking skills of a Microsoft certified engineer by his own admission uh when and start snooping around

113
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,880
and wound up actually finding any any basically was really using Microsoft technology so it's just

114
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,320
how secure it is of course it wasn't locked down the uh the the admin passwords are all blank

115
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:47,760
and he came up with uh one picture which uh i'm trying to find it now not the picture itself

116
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,760
because you know actually didn't even really see the picture other than in some low res almost like a

117
00:13:51,760 --> 00:14:00,080
vnc you know screen copy he found that in uh he had found two folders of uh spacecraft apparently

118
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:06,080
or craft one marked touch the other one untouched and probably the more interesting piece of data

119
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:14,000
that he said he's seen but did not download was a spreadsheet uh which listed quote non-terrestrial

120
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,120
officers and quote fleet to fleet transfers and it had names but it wasn't specified if this was like

121
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:29,440
extraterrestrial um officers or fleet or if uh if it was maybe air force i mean that this is what

122
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,880
he says he saw and so the guy's been sitting here and the u.s wants to extradite him and they want

123
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,320
to throw him in jail and they really want to throw him in jail for like 60 or 70 years you know

124
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,880
trying to get the maximum uh out of uh i guess it's like five five years and five thousand dollar

125
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,920
fine for every computer you quote destroy or or break uh in a hacking attempt so uh uh the

126
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:00,240
guy is definitely uh definitely going down for a long time if they get him and he's been and he's

127
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,680
been uh wow there's something wrong with the sound here today i'm just gonna ignore it um so this

128
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,160
Gary McKinnon has been fighting this and he uh he just lost his uh appeal for this extradition by the way

129
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,720
there's no agreement as far as i understand between the u.s and the u.k. for extradition

130
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,200
yeah there's a one-sided agreement uh which of course uh the the british government signed the

131
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,680
u.s. government apparently has not signed and so they're gonna they're gonna send this guy out

132
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,600
he hasn't been tried here in the u.k uh there's been no real proceeding as far as i can understand

133
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,080
they're gonna throw them over to the states and because of this because of what he did i mean yeah

134
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,360
it should be stopped yes you could make an example of him but 60 70 years extradition

135
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,200
getting thrown in jail and this is a heavy ass shit man and why what's so important about these

136
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,880
pictures that he only he saw hasn't made copies over hasn't shown us at least or this spreadsheet

137
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,520
i mean you guys someone must really think this guy is extremely dangerous in order to

138
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:06,400
to put him into this level of uh uh i'd call this beyond harassment it's it's just a little bit

139
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,760
crazy uh all the links by the way you can find on the drop at daily source code or drop

140
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,320
out of your slash daily source code but today i will also be posting all of them in the links

141
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:25,840
at daily source code dot com okay all right so uh and there's so many cool phone calls that

142
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,600
came in so much excellence stuff first i got to play something that's a little bit the light

143
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,560
hearted here this is from our buddy Ray he's totally making this into a it seems like a weekly item

144
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:50,560
it is well what can i say the soundtrack to my life

145
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,320
soundtrack to my life my life let's take a look at the landscape on a rope trip through your life

146
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:07,680
this episode of anchors the soundtrack to my life brings us back to 1987 and was 12 years old

147
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:14,240
during 13 in September i'm living with his parents and some sisters in nestle and omsle very

148
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:21,040
small but beautiful village just outside the southwest of Amsterdam and when for his education to do

149
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,920
and still i can say i'm glad to fail that time for you for a progressive religious high school

150
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,920
in the south of Amsterdam during this school period and of course the start of his purity

151
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,240
and was getting very interested in radio and transmitting he had to rebuild his whole transmitter

152
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:44,320
with streets probably handled the street with his parents and was having such a good time with his

153
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:54,320
broadcasts and so on to one of the people who is 27 and so yes the skyder

154
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,320
well here we will have you radio transmitter you've got to be a piece of junkie also

155
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,760

163
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,120
and talked to the dust of four in the beginning of this week's road trip and the curries

164
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:09,760
the soundtrack to my life takes a trip out and we're laying to 1970s and we don't walk in pain

177
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:43,120
For being an open way, they can tell it to make you so much better about yourself, it's just so eventually all from me, about the fath man to remember him and the speech without it shall end it from nothing to nothing to say.

178
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
So what are you doing?

179
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
You talk about what you want to know.

180
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,120
Who is Skybird?

181
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,120
I think you got inspired to come to me.

182
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,120
And how am I the sun, man?

183
00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:24,120
And you played it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over

184
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,520
and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over

185
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,220
stuff and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over right over and over and over and over

186
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:37,760
and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over God Eve,

187
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,720
behind that about about the kid and being called fat and turning

188
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,840
into a song about rubber band man. That's cool. But actually I missed some

189
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,520
of the scratches that were that I knew exactly where you would hear the

190
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,720
scratch or the little ticks in the in the record. I was I could I could

191
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,280
my subconscious was like waiting for that to come back. It wasn't

192
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,960
skybird actually. I know what you're talking about man. This is T-burdened.

193
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,720
Oh yeah, the good old days of the CBs. Yeah, I was way into that shit.

194
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:14,080
I had a single side band and would use either USB or LSB. By the way,

195
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,880
that's why USB originally meant was upper side band before it became a memory

196
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,720
stick. And then you had LSB, which is the lower side band. And what you do is

197
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,200
you'd cut a diode attached to one of the prongs on the chip in your I think

198
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,800
maybe it was cutting a diode or jumping it with a wire. I can't remember. I had

199
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:38,000
one of those radio-shack realistic base stations. It was a fantastic fantastic.

200
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,040
So on 12 watts, P-E-P, peak envelope power. You could actually get to higher

201
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:49,000
frequencies. Effectively, you know, turning your 120 channel citizens band

202
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,360
transmitter into like 240. And you know, it could talk with from the Netherlands

203
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:02,640
from the house where we were at man. I could talk to Ohio to some of the KMG

204
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,200
people who were also on those frequencies illegally. And KMG stood for kiss my

205
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,280
grits. Why don't I remember all this stuff? I could go into that quite quite

206
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,480
some length, actually quite some depth. I had an antenna of five and a half

207
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,560
meter antenna, which of course is exactly half a wave length of these 27

208
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:26,000
megahertz transmitters, the CB band. And I had it hooked up to a hinge. I could

209
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,360
pull a rope from my room, which the rope went over the roof. It was, you know,

210
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,720
kind of camouflage roof. And through a series of pullies, and I could erect this

211
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,920
five and a half meter antenna to then start broadcast. And because of course, it

212
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,560
was all illegal. And and honestly, blessed my parents, man, for let me do all

213
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,560
that shit. I cannot believe to this day. They actually let me kind of wear

214
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,120
with all of that. All right. Of all the phone calls that came in through the

215
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,160
voicemail lines, phones, phone numbers listed in this show notes of daily source code

216
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,440
dot com. The most response came to the call that we received last week on the

217
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,960
full bar Friday from Chris from Seattle, I believe, who just doesn't believe that

218
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,320
911, there was any cover up involved. In fact, he went, he was quite passionate

219
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,560
by saying, you know, if any news organization actually had this information, it

220
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,240
would be the story of the year. There would be the richest news organization in

221
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,600
the world. And I think I rebuttered him well enough. And you can find a copy of

222
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,600
that rebuttal and of his original comment on the on the drop drop.io slash daily

223
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,000
source code. But he did call back in again. And this is in response to my

224
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,960
response. So let's get this out of the way right off the bat. And everyone's waiting

225
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,880
for it to hear more from Chris from Seattle. Oops. Sorry. Here we go. Hey, Adam Chris

226
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,320
Cochrane here from Seattle. Just listen to your response to my call last week about

227
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,480
you being full crap. And I said, oh, yeah, there was that too. I find it interesting. I

228
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,040
think you're missing a huge, huge point here. And as you point being, there's a huge

229
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,720
difference between rumor, mongering and journalism. Journalism is supposed to be

230
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,440
oh, rumor, mongering and journalism. You mean like when I turn on these six o'clock

231
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:12,200
news and I actually see stuff about the terrible triumvirant of Brittany, Lindsey,

232
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,600
and what's her name? Paris. I mean, that's all truth that we're reporting. They do

233
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,600
on them. I mean, they they have the actual information. They have the actual facts. Come on, Chris.

234
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,160
They're reporting of facts as it become available. Now, I think that's a very simplistic

235
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,000
view of it. But that's what journalism is supposed to be. And the news agencies that

236
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,720
we're talking about are supposed to be journalists. Okay. Fact. No building native steel ever

237
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,240
in the history of buildings made of steel. Fact. This, by the way, is not something

238
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,480
you'll find in the 911 Commission report. Fact, no building native steel has ever completely

239
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:56,520
collapsed or even partially collapsed onto itself due to fire on September 11th, not one,

240
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,880
not two, but three buildings of steel did this for the first time ever in architectural

241
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,240
history. Fact. Now, we all know they're seeing us a bunch of crap. We all know they lied

242
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,920
to us. We all know they've been the story toward whatever specific agenda that they want

243
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,840
to, you know, portraying the media or whatever. But the bottom line is they have to report

244
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,840
facts. Your question was, well, how come the Warren Commission report are the 911

245
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,800
Commission report got so much press. But all these other areas don't get press. Well, the

246
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:30,560
real reason, because the Warren Commission was a guided commission. Now, I don't know exactly

247
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:36,480
you're absolutely right. It was a guided commission. In fact, go look at the names of the

248
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,040
commission, the people who put this together. Look at the executive director and then Google

249
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:48,040
this name for me, Chris, Philip Zelekau, Philip the way you'd expect to spell it. Zelekau

250
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:56,640
Zulu echo Lima, India, Kilo Oscar whiskey. Just Google his name, okay, and see who

251
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,520
his friends are. Wasn't supposed to be a bipartisan report. He, he, he, not only is he

252
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,480
personal friends with conglies arise. He actually wrote a book, whether you got to be

253
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,040
pretty good friends to write a book. That's not very partisan. In addition, he wrote

254
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:19,280
some very interesting material about public myths. And in fact, some of his material taken

255
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,840
from my belief is dissertation was actually copied and used in the project for a new American

256
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,880
century. I mean, you can find plenty of this stuff. Just look at the top five links when

257
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,880
you Google his name, okay? So let's just keep it that for the second about the 911

258
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,600
commission. I don't think they necessarily told the 100% truth. I don't know. But

259
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,960
I want to do know is this for multiple people who suppose we had some accountability

260
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,600
going through all the information available to them. And or what they claim was the information

261
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,440
available to them. Again, I don't want to discuss the whole of the theories or the best

262
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,120
part of this. But my bigger question is, by the way, the 911 Commission report is

263
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,120
a theory. It's exactly what it is. It's a theory about a conspiracy to attack America.

264
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,720
It's a conspiracy theory. Only it's one that's published that has an official seal of

265
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,480
approval right on it. Again, go look at the people who are on that commission, okay, Chris?

266
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,480
And then you tell me what's fact. And how come, by the way, there's not a single solitary

267
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,880
mention of World Trade Center number seven in the entire Commission report. Not a single

268
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,760
mention of it. You know, so I guess we can exclude that from their conspiracy theory and we can

269
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,240
create our own. Wouldn't it be nice if they actually came out? They being the Commission

270
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,840
or whoever's in charge today and actually provided some information or their version of

271
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,480
the conspiracy theory about World Trade Center number seven? That will be kind of nice.

272
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,880
Why? Because I think that's an A more fun topic talk about. And B, it's actually more important

273
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,280
topic. You'll use all of this that crap are entire lives by the media and by government.

274
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,360
So the bigger question is why? And that's where the conspiracy theories come in.

275
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,240
Ah, okay. I'm glad you asked why. Well, of course, if this was set up, you know, why

276
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,800
was it set up? Well, just look at the geography and then look at all the wars that are

277
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,600
taking place, man, that'll really start to take, explain it all. And look at what's what's

278
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,480
actually happening before our very eyes. It is, it seems like things are even moving faster

279
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,360
when you see how, well, now we have the European Union, although not quite because we want

280
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,560
to be a lot bigger than any other union that we have, which I think is we're currently

281
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,480
operating under the Maastricht Treaty. So we need to have all 27 of these countries to have

282
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,800
all this universal law and have the European army. We already have the money, which has

283
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,280
been integrated a couple other countries want to have our money as well for reasons. They

284
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,720
think is good because they'll get big loans, which of course, they'll never be able to pay

285
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,440
off. They'll get that from the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank.

286
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,320
But that's why they're ramming through this Lisbon Treaty, man, because they want to

287
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,880
have that. And then we have our Asia-Pacific Union. We have the newly announced Mediterranean

288
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,400
Union, which we didn't really need, but we had to group a couple more countries together.

289
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,560
And then, of course, and you watch, Chris, you can call it crazy now and you can not believe

290
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:16,040
that we're not sitting on the, that we're sitting on the biggest story of our lifetime

291
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,360
and that we're not reporting it. It's not being reported on for us, the North American

292
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,400
Union. Now, you'll hear this mentioned on, on different program that you may not watch

293
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:32,280
typically like CNBC. Blue dobs has talked about this. You take blue dobs serious to see mainstream

294
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,600
enough? Sure. But one guy is not going to make the difference. One guy talking about it doesn't

295
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,200
make the news. Everybody has to follow it. And as we've spoken before, when there's

296
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,880
directives from above in the DNA of a company to not talk about it, it just doesn't happen.

297
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,720
But you watch, those unions are going to be all put together and then we'll have a one

298
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:56,840
world government on top of it, which is literally what Ronald Reagan and George Bush

299
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:02,360
for the senior engine, you're have literally talked about the new world order and you

300
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,680
all live in perfect harmony. Unfortunately, look at what your own government is doing to you.

301
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,160
Let alone some guys who are abstracted up three levels higher and don't really don't give

302
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:16,440
a shit about us. That's why they're doing it because that's where all the power is. That's

303
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:22,600
where all the money is. And absolute power corrupts absolutely. And power is a very, it's I think

304
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:28,840
the strongest Afrodisiac known to mankind. And obviously to hybrid kind.

305
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,080
For instance, I mean, that's the question I haven't heard you talk about yet. And that's the

306
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,240
question that I'd love to hear you address is really why. You know, yeah, there's a bunch of

307
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,360
freaking conspiracy is going on. People can spy all the time in the world. Why? Why are they doing

308
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:51,640
it? Just for world power. I'm glad. Already in power. How great. Love you.

309
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:58,600
Yeah, well, no, no, no, no. I love you too, man. Of course. Yeah, well, of course, it's all about power.

310
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,880
It's exactly what it's about. And this probably, you know, amongst the the true owners of the

311
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:11,240
universe, you know, Rockefeller, Rothschild, Warburg, there's probably competition amongst those guys,

312
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,320
too. And you know, someone that probably all get ready to stab each other in the backs as well.

313
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,320
That's why they come up with all these secret societies to, you know, keep some kind of brotherhoods.

314
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,560
They don't go kill any other. But history is littered with this shit, man. This has been going on

315
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:28,920
for eons as long as mankind has been writing about it. You know, truly a Caesar.

316
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:37,000
The Apatra. Oh, um, these are just some recent ones that should ring true. Look, and Hitler.

317
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:45,640
Okay. So, and, and when it comes to the third Reich, wow. I mean, media had a lot to do with it.

318
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:55,400
Go Google, uh, Mr., uh, Mr. Gubbles. Go Google Hen. GO E-B-B-E-L-S. I think it is.

319
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,080
And, uh, you'll start to wake up, Chris. And that's actually what I hear. And that kind of makes me smile

320
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,840
when I hear your comment. Because I know that you're getting close. You're asking the right questions.

321
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,760
I think you have to do a little more research. And don't worry, man. You're not, you're not,

322
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,600
you're not, you're not cracking up. You're not a nut. You're not freaking out. If you start saying

323
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Jesus, Chris, I can't, I actually believe in this stuff. This stuff is really convincing.

324
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:23,160
Because at the end of the day, um, us waking up, we're waking up to a lot of things.

325
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,920
Yeah. So, you might not be waking up to the big global grand scale. Maybe that's a little

326
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,520
to a big fee to see at this moment in time. But, you know, look at what you're putting.

327
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,240
Look what you're paying for, for gas prices. And you'll look at what your, what your tax dollars are

328
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:42,760
doing. That everything's tax, man. Everything. The roads you drive on. You know, if you drink,

329
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,200
alcohol you drink, if you smoke, the cigarettes you smoke, uh, if you, you know, this, uh, this

330
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:54,520
tax is on, this is a tax on shopping. This is a tax on stuff you buy. This is a tax. Everything is tax.

331
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,440
And it's all going to your government. Do you really feel you're getting value for the money?

332
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,120
If you're working for five, six, maybe even seven months out of the year, working for the

333
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:08,520
man? No, I know you're not feeling that way, man. Uh, switching gears. Uh, there's a lot of,

334
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,520
uh, I don't understand why this all of a sudden is such big news. Well, actually, I do, I guess,

335
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:17,000
because, uh, that's how it works, right? When it catches on and it goes viral, then it's news.

336
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:25,000
So, I guess there was a confirmation from, um, uh, border and immigration, uh,

337
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:31,080
actually, it's a customs and border protection agency. Uh, that, yes, they, uh, do feel that they have the

338
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:37,160
right to search through laptops and any other, uh, electronic devices that might have hard drives.

339
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,760
You know, it could be cell phone, your iPod, you know, video, tapes, audio tapes, and, uh, they

340
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:48,040
can take those for investigation. They've had that right and they've been doing that for, uh,

341
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:54,840
for a long time. Um, and the law is very, very clear. When you are outside of the

342
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,440
US, when you're at the border, you do not have the civil rights of a US citizen. Now,

343
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,080
do I think that we have, do I feel that we have inalienable rights and rights as human beings?

344
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:11,960
Absolutely. Are those being violated? Yeah. I mean, dude, I used to remember coming to the

345
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:18,040
US, it would be like, hey, welcome to welcome back home. Welcome to America. It's not like that anymore.

346
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,640
And for me, in particular, because I'm about to make another trip coming up this week and coming

347
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,240
out to the States, and I know I'm going to go through the whole rigour roll again. In fact,

348
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,760
I'm, uh, just to make absolutely sure, I'm cleaning out the entire cache of all my browsers,

349
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:36,440
Joe, that didn't, you know, nothing can be found. I don't want any questions whatsoever about

350
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:42,760
anything. Um, because it could absolutely happen. They could absolutely take my laptop and

351
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,760
look through it and give it to me whenever they feel, um, they want to. And, uh, as the law stands

352
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,320
now, yeah, they have that right as nothing to do with, um, with the US Constitution,

353
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:58,200
as everything to do with our attitude, that's for sure. And that, and does it piss me off? Yeah,

354
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,560
absolutely. And, and so what are they looking for? They're looking for, it's always the same things.

355
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:10,440
They're looking for, um, stolen software. They're looking for stolen music. They're looking for

356
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,920
child pornography. And, of course, all kinds of terror stuff. Um, so I just wanted to say that,

357
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,440
you know, this is not new. They've been doing this. And they've been able to do this. And they've

358
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,400
been quite harassing to me. I'm usually detained for an extra hour and a half to two hours. Every

359
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:31,160
single coming, every single time I come into my own country with the US passport, I go through this.

360
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:36,680
I keep, you know, filling out the forms. I fill out the freedom of information, act, and, you know,

361
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,360
and then, so I can find out what they have in the database. I know what they have in the database.

362
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,520
They say they're looking for some other guys, some other Adam Curry from Nebraska. You know,

363
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,760
please go look for him. Get this guy. I'm tired of him. You know, they can't seem to change that

364
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:59,800
information. Uh, so right along with this, this is a great story. Those of you who've been listening

365
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,040
if you're a true chucklehead, you've been around, you know about the clear program, uh, which have

366
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,440
been harpen on ever since I saw at launch at San Francisco Airport. So this clear program,

367
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,280
we willingly give up your biometric data, namely your fingerprints and your retinal scan.

368
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,720
To the, uh, to the feds through, uh, you know, through another, through another party, through a

369
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:27,080
commercial party, in this case, the clear program. I can't forget who actually, um, runs the company.

370
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,960
I mean, we looked into that before. It's actually a Silicon Valley guy who's had some moderate success.

371
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,240
And anyway, I've been way against this because, you know, what you get is you get into like a

372
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:43,480
faster line. And of course, they check you out, they continue to monitor you. Members are monitored,

373
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:50,280
so that you're completely in the clear. So to speak. Oh, uh, a laptop was stolen. If you hadn't

374
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:56,280
read this already, it's just if it's too funny. A laptop was actually stolen from the clear program

375
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:03,160
people at San Francisco, SFO San Francisco Airport, which included, oh, like, uh, 30,000, uh,

376
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,880
members, names, passengers who had one of these, 30, actually, 33,000 applicants.

377
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,520
Information included names, addresses, birthdays and in some cases, driver license and passport

378
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:19,400
numbers and other data. Like, yeah, you're biometric data. And then, uh, who's it as the gall to say?

379
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:27,800
Whoa, is it some, maybe it's just the passenger? Yeah. So in this story, I'm reading, they pull out

380
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,080
some, uh, a traveler, uh, Giovanni Gallucci. He sounds like a traveler from outer space.

381
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,200
Your information is everywhere. And people volunteer. Their information on places like Facebook on Twitter,

382
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,480
my space and stuff said Giovanni Gallucci, a traveler. I guess it's just one of the

383
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,160
many ways that people can get our information. I mean, you hear about it all the time.

384
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:53,880
Laptops being stolen says Scott bottles. A traveler. Yeah. But it wasn't combined with your biometric

385
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,040
data, with your fingerprints and your retinal scan. And of course, they'll deny that that was a

386
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:06,200
part of what was stolen on the laptop. But this just goes to show. And who stole it? You know,

387
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:14,360
no signs of a break in? This is very, very worrying. All of this stuff. But I'm so happy now.

388
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,840
I'm really, really happy that I fought against this program and we'll not become a part of it because

389
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:26,680
it's see, there you go. Told you so. Crazy. Let's see what else we got here on the phone lines.

390
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,520
But I'm going in there. They go in my Easter breast still for the morning.

391
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,400
You know, names of daily source code for about the delusional source code.

392
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:43,720
Yeah, functional source code. Delusional. I'm just reading the news for you today, man. There's nothing

393
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:51,720
delusional about it today. It gets source code. It's delusional source code. So it's 24 feet with

394
00:40:51,720 --> 00:41:01,080
no words and under the peaceful space for us. Great work. I'm just going to keep it daily source

395
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,080
code for now until we come to something different for some reason. But think about the word source code.

396
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,720
Actually, when you think about that, I'm finding that this program, this show has actually

397
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:16,200
changed my DNA somehow. It is, well, maybe it has loosened up or energized or awakened a part of

398
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:22,840
my DNA. And source code is really a part of that. I think that maybe I'm injecting source code into you.

399
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:29,480
So take that and come up with a name. I'm injecting source code. I'm upgrading. We're upgrading

400
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:36,520
all the time. I called my sister the other day who lives in Italy, Willow. And she was actually

401
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,440
as she was camping. So I didn't want to ask her about this because she had just gotten there.

402
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:47,800
But you probably heard about Berlusconi now putting soldiers onto streets in some of the major

403
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:53,160
cities in Italy. Berlusconi, of course, Sylvia Berlusconi being the prime minister of Italy,

404
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,480
who has been the prime minister before. I kicked out for a while, came back because all kinds of

405
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:03,720
shenanigans he's involved with. He also, by the way, owns the largest Italian media companies.

406
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,640
Is there conflict of interest there, perhaps? So he's got thousands of troops on the streets

407
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:15,240
of some of their big cities like Malon and Rome. And was there any other streets they mentioned here?

408
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:24,600
Malon, Rome, Naples, Palermo, Venice. And from this report, which comes from the telegraph in the UK,

409
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:31,640
anti-gathering laws were enacted, which means you could not have more than three people standing

410
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:37,160
together in the street. Otherwise, it would be seen as a gathering.

411
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:46,520
Why? What is going on? This is crazy. A Chris in the Christen Seattle. Do you hear this, man?

412
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:51,720
Wouldn't that be weird if all of a sudden we had the troops out in the streets and you couldn't

413
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,440
have more than three people gathering together? This is Italy, man. That's supposed to be democratic.

414
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:04,760
Speaking of that, I'm actually moving a story up here. Gosh, and I can't wait to post these

415
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:10,680
links because they're absolutely excellent. I saw this from a couple of different sources. I'm just

416
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:18,200
going to post one of the links. This is about a drug bust in California. And this was in the Los Angeles

417
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:23,400
times. And you can actually go to the Los Angeles Times website and you can, you can, and this actual

418
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:30,520
page that I'll put in the in the show notes at dailysourceco.com. It tells you what to look for and

419
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,640
where to look for it. So there was a bust of, and there's a whole story here as to why there was a

420
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:42,280
medical marijuana facility was rated by federal agents. So the Los Angeles Times post these pictures

421
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:48,840
online and you see a whole bunch of police and then you see one shot of a guy who was also clearing

422
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,520
out some, you know, box of either marijuana or plants or other paraphernalia, whatever the

423
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:00,840
guys, he's, I'm just going to enlarge this picture. He's got a, it looks like he's got a Glock nine

424
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:07,960
with sophisticated holster. He's got on. It's not like a standard issue. It's got a leg strap.

425
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:14,680
And what you can clearly see is that the guy, by the way, has a ponytail and a go-t. He's wearing a

426
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:22,440
blackwater t-shirt. And I sure hope this barks off some some questions that we can get some answers to.

427
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,360
I mean, is it already now at this point where we have blackwater, who, of course, are delivering

428
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:34,920
troops, some call them death squads, but troops into a, into a rock. I don't know if they're

429
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,280
now Afghanistan or not, but I think there's tens of thousands of them. Are they now actually

430
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,560
doing the work of the police? Do we now actually have a private police force? Are we outsourcing

431
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:52,280
some of this stuff to blackwater? You know, please, someone, let me know, get into this.

432
00:44:53,080 --> 00:45:03,080
This is just absolutely amazing. And I'm just full of good ones today. If you've never seen

433
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:12,920
Fedspending.org, go check it out. They actually have a list, you know, for fiscal quarter, 2008,

434
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:19,640
the first quarter, the top 100 recipients of federal contract awards for the first three months of

435
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:25,400
2008. How much money they were receiving? What a great site this is. I guess they kind of reverse

436
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:34,040
engineer the, what is it? The federal procurement data system. So they can find out who got what

437
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,400
and how much money they got paid for. And then they link it through to where the work is being

438
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,600
executed and what congressional districts those are in. So let's just take a look at this,

439
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:51,240
talking about privatization. This is obviously mainly about the war. Number one, and this is only

440
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:56,600
for three months, right? For the first three months of the year, the Boeing corporation awarded

441
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:07,560
just chive $3 billion, which is only by the way, 5.8% of the entire amount of contracts awarded

442
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:15,000
in the quarter. And so if you click through to it, you know, it's a aircraft rotary wing,

443
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,960
which is helicopters, research and development, operational systems, services, basic research,

444
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:25,640
other demands, defense, advance development, et cetera, et cetera. So let's just go down to

445
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:31,720
list. Number two is Lockheed Martin with $2.5 billion. North of Grumman, they make battleships

446
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:38,760
1.6 billion. Number five actually is the company that the economic hitman, John Perkins worked for.

447
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,400
If you've never read the book, confession of an economic hitman, please do you'll learn about

448
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:49,720
this company that received $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2008. I mean, it's just, it's

449
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:56,040
all a military industrial complex all the way down until, well, I did, Dick Cheney's going to be

450
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:03,080
pissed off. KBR, which of course is, uh, as a part of Haliburton, only 383 million,

451
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:11,160
huh, they're not doing so good on their quotas. Um, it's just, it's all, it's all, um, logistics.

452
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:18,840
Oh, Glaxo Smith client number 47. What are they provide? $165 million. Let's see. So I click through

453
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:26,440
chemicals, $165 million worth of chemicals, and then $194,000 on drugs and biologicals,

454
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:34,200
$32,000 a medical and surgical equipments, equip instruments, I'm sorry. Another 32

455
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:42,360
grand for laboratory equipment and supplies, and then 5,000 for pharmacology services, $165 million

456
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,880
for chemicals. What chemicals did we need? And what are we doing with them?

457
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:54,280
Oh, please have a look at all of those links. You will not regret it, I guarantee.

458
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,920
Let's play some more songs. Again, all of this coming off of the drop it to drop.co slash

459
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,880
daily source code.

460
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:17,240
Got to get the big pay. I got call note to rent and of the nonsense that's slowly turning

461
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:22,120
me into a slave, but it's okay. Because of the crew, I got the best clothes and the best

462
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:26,120
neighborhood, and that's when it's about the American dream. We in the rack range,

463
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:30,360
but the rats one queen in and up seen a mountain, more than I can count. So I'm all

464
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,600
breaking hands that I'm drowning in. In the oceans of life, I've read full of strength.

465
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:39,320
And my head extra smashed, just pound it down. He come to tears up the cloud,

466
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,080
the hardest thing in the whole town this time. But my friend, that's inside. He's sitting

467
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,880
by my mind. He comes to everything, I'm on his mind.

468
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,720
I got to peek out, just to make sure, but say, because these times is changing and reshaping

469
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,880
in the summer, I can't face in a filestream. We got religious people, church and a whole

470
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,600
world we got. Bems and holes, once, boys and girls we got. The media telling us who's the

471
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:27,480
blame, but who's the media who's really running the game. Gotta get up, gotta shake it off,

472
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,120
just like the longest, unsunger in the dark. I'm getting confused, I'm getting upset,

473
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:36,040
things don't work out, I'm up in the check, regrets, creepers up my window, my life is

474
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,600
reaching up her window. I got to know my what's raking in gold, but she said, and dream, I'm

475
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,480
wasting time, because everything I want is mine.

476
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,520
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up,

477
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:09,720
have an inflatable grey day, and everything's okay.

478
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:19,560
I'm doing fine, just don't look it right, I am just fine, believe, and everything's okay,

479
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:26,120
fine, just don't look it right, I am just like the one I got to get up, gotta get up, gotta get up,

480
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:30,760
gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up. I got to get up, gotta get up, gotta get up,

481
00:50:30,760 --> 00:51:00,760
I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I

482
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:30,760
got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up now, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up all night, and get up, I got to get up all night, and get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I got to get up, I

483
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,760
The way to the world, living in the American Dream is...

484
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,760
...and getting a snickers on.

485
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,760
You gotta have the right car.

486
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,760
Oh man, what's that? That's no ending.

487
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,760
What kind of ending is that?

488
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,760
Crap.

489
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,760
Alright, a couple more things is we're moving along in time here.

490
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,760
Here's a story I want you to track.

491
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,760
Oh, particularly Crest and Cricin' Seattle.

492
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,760
I really want you to track this story, man.

493
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,760
Because actually we've got a phone call about it.

494
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:03,760
And this is just too much happening when it comes to people who are involved in governmental affairs.

495
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,760
And I'm killing themselves.

496
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:13,760
For the most peculiar things and reasons and the way you're doing it is just lots and lots of questions.

497
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,760
Adam, Eric and Portland.

498
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,760
Eric.

499
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,760
Bruce E. Ivan is dead.

500
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,760
Yes.

501
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:28,760
Apparently, reportedly committed suicide right before being arrested in connection with the

502
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,760
Anthrax attacks. I can see that I'm state.

503
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,760
Something smells fishy about this.

504
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,760
I think we need more research on this.

505
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,760
Yeah.

506
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,760
For the call...

507
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,760
Alright, Seattle, that said...

508
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,760
Oh, yeah, here we go.

509
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,760
The newspapers and the media wouldn't hold back on the story.

510
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:50,760
Remember, after September 11th, we were in shock in 177 days later.

511
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:56,760
Anthrax was set to ABC News, NBC News, CBS News,

512
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,760
The New York Post and other media outlets.

513
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,760
It's a clear case of intimidation.

514
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,760
If you follow the 911 story, you will have something bad happen to you.

515
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:13,760
On October 9th, Democratic Senate Leader Tom Dachel and Patrick Lazy.

516
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,760
Get Anthrax sent to them.

517
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,760
Again, clear intimidation, military grave.

518
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,760
Anthrax.

519
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,760
You know, intimidation or in the case of the news media distraction, perhaps?

520
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,760
I mean, there was a lot going on.

521
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,760
Fact, Chris.

522
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,760
Man, that ground zero.

523
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,760
That got chopped up real quick and carted off.

524
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,760
And it's now buried where no one can go and do any forensics on it.

525
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,760
Fact.

526
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,760
Here's what I want you to take a look at.

527
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,760
This is when I come across this one.

528
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,760
This was pretty interesting.

529
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,760
It probably came from the drop.

530
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,760
American every man.

531
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,760
It's a blog, okay, from Willy Loman dot WordPress dot com.

532
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,760
But Willy was reading this story in the New York Times.

533
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,760
And he saw that the story was actually changing it as he was reading it.

534
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,760
And he's he's documented some of these changes.

535
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,760
So that's the first thing to take a look at.

536
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,760
Also, look at the methods used by the FBI,

537
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,760
claiming will be the methods where there's they prove that Bruce Evans or

538
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,760
Ivan's that he actually did this.

539
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,760
And it includes some newfangled DNA type of science that has never before been used.

540
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,760
Yeah, okay.

541
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,760
But the thing that really bothers me about this, the most.

542
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:38,760
The really, really bugs me is if he's a guy who works in a lab and has access to

543
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,760
contracts.

544
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,760
And he wants to kill himself.

545
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:48,760
Why does he as the reports claim take massive doses of Tylenol with coding?

546
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,760
And it literally says massive quantity.

547
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,760
I mean, the guy just like shoving this down or throw it.

548
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,760
Isn't there an easier way to kill yourself?

549
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,760
If you actually know how to do it and you've got access to the stuff to do it with,

550
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,760
which could kill you quickly painlessly.

551
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,760
Or as far as we know, just put you to sleep.

552
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,760
I mean, that's weird.

553
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,760
You can't deny that's weird.

554
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,760
And there's been a couple of other really weird ones.

555
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:19,760
Paul Willstone starts talking out about the Iraq war.

556
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,760
And his plane crash is any dies.

557
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:27,760
If you were a U.S. senator and you go against the Bush administration,

558
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,760
you could have bad things happen to you.

559
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,760
So I encourage that guy to research 9-11.

560
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,760
Research physics of WEC7.

561
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,760
How did that fall without getting hit by a plane?

562
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,760
Research the intimidation.

563
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,760
Research the Senate assassinations.

564
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,760
Research Bruce E. Evans.

565
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,760
Apparent suicide.

566
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,760
Crazy is out of the box today.

567
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,760
Awareness is not a metal mental.

568
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,760
Disorder.

569
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,760
And I'm wide awake in train.

570
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,760
Yeah, baby.

571
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,760
Let me say.

572
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,760
Then there's, here's this other one, man.

573
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,760
This is, this is also a bug of me.

574
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,760
Brigadier General Thomas Tinsley.

575
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,760
Suffered a gunshot wound to his chest.

576
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,760
Late Sunday night and was pronounced dead within a half hour.

577
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,760
This is the officer who commands an Air Force wing in Alaska.

578
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,760
And they're calling this self-inflicted.

579
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,760
Better known as a suicide.

580
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:44,760
He was, he now he had just resigned in June under pressure in an agent's,

581
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,760
quote, agency shake up.

582
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,760
We should investigate that.

583
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,760
I think someone had to do with procurement, but you don't know.

584
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,760
What's going on in Alaska?

585
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,760
And here's this Brigadier General who apparently is so embarrassed about what he's

586
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,760
wrapped up in in his life.

587
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,760
He's going to kill himself and he shoots himself in the chest.

588
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,760
Come on.

589
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,760
That just makes no sense.

590
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,760
The truth can be crazy.

591
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,760
But I think that needs a little bit of research.

592
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,760
Absolutely right.

593
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,760
We got to look at these things.

594
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,760
Let me see.

595
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,760
Did I have another one here?

596
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,760
No.

597
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,760
By the way, I would suggest, you know, the nine eleven, which, you know,

598
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,760
this is now seven years ago.

599
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,760
I want to continue to research that looking for the truth.

600
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,760
I think maybe I want to, it's never going to be a waste of energy.

601
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,760
But there's so much more.

602
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,760
We have to kind of start to jump ahead and see what the next step is going to be.

603
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,760
That's what I'm doing.

604
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,760
You know, I'm looking beyond what they're going to,

605
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,760
once the Lisbon Treaty is rammed down islands,

606
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,760
throat, and island is either no longer a part of the EU,

607
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,760
or is on a slow track or a secondary speed,

608
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,760
or basically ignored and but we left the bleed to death.

609
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,760
I'm looking beyond that, you know,

610
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:04,760
and I absolutely personally am convinced that something is completely wrong with nine eleven,

611
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,760
and I don't know which of the theories isn't play,

612
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,760
but something happened there that never should have happened,

613
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,760
and there is culpability, and it's on our government,

614
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,760
and we know who's involved in the shenanigans.

615
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:23,760
But researching that over and over again is not going to prepare us for the next big thing,

616
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,760
or the next thing that's going to happen.

617
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:29,760
So I'm paying attention to all the post-saber rattling that's going on about Iran.

618
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,760
I'm looking at Russia now saying,

619
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,760
hey, why don't we go into Cuba,

620
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,760
and let's make friends with Cuba again?

621
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,760
You know, why?

622
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,760
Because the US is like putting rockets in their backyard in Poland,

623
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,760
or attempting to.

624
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,760
In other countries, right near Russia,

625
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,760
you know, what's happening with China?

626
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,760
Man, pay attention to all of that stuff.

627
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,760
That's where you got to start doing the research,

628
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,760
listening to what people are saying,

629
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,760
reading it,

630
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,760
and it is being reported on.

631
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,760
Absolutely.

632
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,760
Even all this crazy stuff about,

633
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,760
about Bruce Ivins.

634
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,760
You know, I think versions of the truth are being reported,

635
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,760
and all kinds of vitally information,

636
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,760
and you can get it from the New York Times.

637
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,760
You can get it from other places that,

638
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,760
you know,

639
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,760
should include people who were reporting fact,

640
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,760
and I do believe there is some fact in it,

641
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,760
but the major talking points as they're known,

642
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,760
the real agenda just never comes up.

643
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,760
It means it does,

644
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,760
but not with enough people.

645
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,760
It's like this show.

646
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,760
This show will never be a worldwide phenomenon.

647
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,760
Why should it be?

648
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,760
Because it had to be mentioned,

649
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,760
at least every week in every newspaper,

650
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,760
every television program.

651
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,760
There's so much distraction.

652
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,760
You forget about it.

653
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,760
Sometimes I even forget about this show.

654
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,760
There it exists.

655
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,760
All right.

656
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,760
Let's wrap this thing up.

657
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,760
One more on all here.

658
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,760
Now I had a DSC in Oregon, actually.

659
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,760
Now in London.

660
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,760
No, welcome.

661
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,760
My friend.

662
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,760
On a job up here.

663
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,760
I'm amazed at the news coverage.

664
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,760
I see I don't know how many people handle the TV in London.

665
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,760
It's terrible.

666
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,760
I'm working.

667
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,760
What we have in America.

668
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,760
I'm not quite understanding if it's terrible,

669
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,760
good, terrible bad.

670
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,760
I mean, I'd love to know what you're talking about.

671
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,760
I mean, in general, the news coverage is certainly not as much of it.

672
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,760
There is some more in depth reporting.

673
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,760
I feel.

674
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,760
But yeah, I'd love to know what you mean,

675
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,760
what by terrible.

676
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,760
You can't tell me that Fox News is great.

677
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,760
I haven't noticed this into the show.

678
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,760
But, uh, and to calling on Skype, not cool.

679
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,760
So that's just online and say,

680
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,760
it's good that people are waking out,

681
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,760
but now we need a direction.

682
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,760
We need to know where we're going.

683
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,760
We need to know what our response to the leaders are.

684
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,760
And how we can achieve, you know,

685
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,760
a correction to all the bad things.

686
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,760
Whether it's a conspiracy or not.

687
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,760
Um,

688
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,760
Oh, okay.

689
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,760
Well, let me, let me address that right off the bat.

690
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,760
So waking up is really all takes waking up and talking with each other about it.

691
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,760
It's all that it will take because then we,

692
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,760
the conversation will guide us.

693
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,760
This is exactly how the presidential briefing,

694
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,760
the daily presidential briefing,

695
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,760
where we found out and this is fact.

696
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,760
The president Bush was absolutely briefs

697
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,760
on what was going to happen on 9.11 in time.

698
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,760
He was briefed.

699
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,760
And how did that get released after the White House refused to release it?

700
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:29,760
You know, classified your eyes only because everybody was talking about it.

701
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,760
And they couldn't get away from it.

702
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,760
And the news organizations then can't ignore it.

703
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,760
Everybody was talking about it.

704
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,760
We've got to be talking about it consistently.

705
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,760
Everything that we have going on now in our,

706
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,760
in our lives.

707
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,760
It has to become a part of our vocabulary.

708
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,760
And you have to, you know,

709
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:49,760
you have to dose it because you can't just be in the business meeting and say,

710
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,760
you know, well,

711
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,760
um, that's great.

712
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,760
We'll do this contract until 2015.

713
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,760
But we're all going to die before the end.

714
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,760
The illuminati are going to get us.

715
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,760
No, that's not exactly going to work.

716
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,760
But you can slip things in.

717
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,760
And you'll see if someone's concluded.

718
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,760
And nine times out of ten.

719
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,760
If you slip something into a conversation,

720
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,760
someone will say, why, you know,

721
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,760
this funny, you say that because dot dot dot dot dot.

722
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,760
And that can usually result in a very interesting conversation,

723
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,760
because it is happening.

724
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,760
Now, whether you think it's the,

725
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,760
the aliens who are doing this to us and waking us up,

726
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,760
whether you think it's the Mayan calendar ending in planet X,

727
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,760
new burrows coming to save us,

728
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,760
take us away, kill us, pick, pick whichever one you want.

729
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,760
Or, or we're just evolving once again.

730
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,760
One thing I know is there's a cage around us,

731
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,760
and that cage is created by bankers,

732
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,760
not the bankers you read about in the news,

733
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,760
but the bankers, bankers, the big guys.

734
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,760
Those are the ones that if cage us in and they're right now,

735
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,760
they're, they're taken up all the money,

736
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,760
all of our money from all of our hard work,

737
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,760
all of the value we've created on earth is being taken away

738
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,760
by these cock suckers.

739
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:00,760
Okay, just realizing that is a step in the right direction.

740
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,760
That's what I think.

741
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,760
We got to take steps too.

742
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,760
There's no immediate fix.

743
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,760
Just like this hasn't happened overnight.

744
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,760
The European Union,

745
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,760
which is heavily contested the way this thing is being run.

746
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,760
Go look at European,

747
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,760
Google, European Parliament,

748
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,760
Demonstration.

749
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,760
And look at the demonstrations that are taking place in Parliament.

750
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,760
Have you ever seen those shots of like Japan,

751
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,760
where in Parliament, where they're all,

752
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,760
you know, jumping on each other and beating each other up?

753
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,760
It's just a little, it's a little bit,

754
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,760
it's not far from that.

755
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,760
Okay, it's really being done with words,

756
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,760
but there's a lot of beating up a lot of signage,

757
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,760
a lot of t-shirts, a lot of protests.

758
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,760
By the way, you don't hear about that too much.

759
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,760
It's not reported widely.

760
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,760
The same way we don't see flags,

761
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,760
drape over coffins coming home with our dead boys and girls.

762
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,760
You don't see that.

763
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,760
It's still a fact that reporting on the numbers.

764
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,760
Talk about that stuff.

765
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,760
Help people to wake up to these facts.

766
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,760
We're really intelligent, all of us.

767
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,760
We can figure this out.

768
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,760
And for us, it won't happen overnight.

769
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,760
But once we start talking about something,

770
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,760
the conversation will take us somewhere,

771
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,760
and something will happen.

772
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,760
Good will come of it.

773
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:13,760
What are we going to do about it?

774
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,760
Nobody talks about that.

775
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,760
They all talk about how bad it is,

776
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,760
and how terrible things are,

777
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,760
and how things are need to change,

778
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,760
but nobody gives any idea.

779
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,760
So if you're in Europe,

780
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,760
you could just slip into a conversation and say,

781
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:27,760
you know,

782
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,760
well, that of course is,

783
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,760
presuming that the Lisbon Treaty will be ratified,

784
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,760
and Ireland will be forced to accept it.

785
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,760
Just throw that one into the conversations.

786
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:38,760
You know what people most like to say?

787
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,760
Damn, man.

788
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:40,760
That thing sucks.

789
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,760
And you could say did you read it?

790
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:43,760
You say,

791
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,760
and of course I'll say no.

792
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,760
Don't worry,

793
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,760
none of the politicians did either.

794
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,760
It's a legal document.

795
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,760
Then we're supposed to not look at the small print.

796
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,760
You'll have a great conversation,

797
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,760
and maybe even a better business relationship for it.

798
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,760
The only thing that seems to keep popping in my head,

799
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,760
is,

800
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,760
oh, we need to pre-fight a lot as the individual.

801
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:07,760
We need to take responsibility for our actions,

802
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,760
and to take the responsibility of others,

803
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,760
for our actions away from,

804
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,760
yes,

805
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,760
they work for us,

806
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,760
but they're not working.

807
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,760
Maybe we need to start working for ourselves,

808
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,760
and start moving forward,

809
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,760
rather than just talking about it.

810
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,760
Anyways, love the show.

811
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,760
Who knows,

812
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,760
maybe we'll see each other in the downtown area,

813
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,760
somewhere if you're ever down there.

814
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,760
Right now, I get a slow.

815
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,760
You break it up.

816
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,760
You break it up.

817
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,760
All this and keep on talking.

818
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:43,760
You know,

819
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,760
I'm sorry,

820
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:45,760
you're breaking up there,

821
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,760
but I appreciate the comment,

822
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,760
and that is my answer.

823
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,760
Just wake up,

824
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,760
talk about it with other people.

825
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:51,760
Don't go crazy,

826
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,760
but talk about it.

827
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,760
You'll have a better life like this.

828
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,760
You'll get laid more often guarantee

829
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:01,760
from your friends at the Charlie's house.

830
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,760
No delays.

831
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,760
Looks like everything's so tough to think.

832
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,760
No cancellations,

833
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,760
reservations,

834
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,760
you don't walk,

835
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,760
and don't cause a thing.

836
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,760
No.

837
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,760
So if you feel it like you need to live,

838
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,760
all be out.

839
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,760
Come along with me,

840
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,760
we're going to have a good time.

841
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,760
Let's take a nap,

842
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,760
play your life,

843
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,760
let's take it,

844
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,760
we are high,

845
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,760
when you never spend it for,

846
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,760
baby,

847
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:35,760
we're going to show.

848
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,760
I'll take you,

849
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,760
I knew my wish,

850
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,760
so you learn how to run.

851
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,760
Let's take a nap,

852
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,760
play your life.

853
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,760
Hey,

854
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:50,760
hey,

855
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,760
hey,

856
01:06:51,760 --> 01:07:03,760
hey,

857
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,760
hey,

858
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,760
hey,

859
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,760
hey,

860
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:11,760
hey,

861
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:11,960
hey,

862
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,760
hey,

863
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,760
hey,

864
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,760
hey,

865
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,760
hey,

866
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,760
ay,

867
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:19,760
hey,

868
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,260
But good time, it's a good middle play, you are

869
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:27,660
Say it way over, way you've never been before

870
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,460
Baby, we go to school

871
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,760
I said, if you're under my wings

872
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,660
I'll steal your love of mine

873
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:39,160
Every ride

874
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,360
I'll steal your love of mine

875
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,460
Oh, yeah, I'll go first, pass

876
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,660
So, baby, hold on tight

877
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:47,760
Because we take all pass

878
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,760
So, baby, I'll shout

879
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,760
I'll steal your love of mine

880
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,760
Call me, Sue, or be the sign

881
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,760
If I hold someone, it's a bye

882
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:59,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

883
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,760
Say, don't use your love

884
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,760
Baby, if you're under my wings

885
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,760
I'll steal your love of mine

886
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,760
Let's take an hour and tonight

887
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,760
Come on, come on

888
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,760
Come on, come on. If you're under my wings

889
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,760
Let's take you away

890
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:45,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

891
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,960
поддерж.

892
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,700
from the drop.

893
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,760
the drop.

894
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,560
drop Danny O. Slash. Daily Source Code.

896
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,400
you can take him here, you'll hi how you go to heaven.

897
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,320
Yeah, I'll take virgin Atlantics leave you.

898
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,200
hour, just tell a port baby.

899
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,400
Airplane Rye.

900
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,160
They wrap it up.

901
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,440
They put a high up speed,

902
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:20,000
off to San Francisco. It's been a while. And we'll have a show before then. I'm sure Lady Patricia's

903
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:27,160
out tomorrow. As I said, she's she's actually going until and she comes back on the day that I leave

904
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:32,440
which sucks. So we're going to miss each other. And then I'll be out and I think the pot daughter

905
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:38,360
is actually she's at some festivals or concerts for two days and camping. I'm going to be

906
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:43,240
all alone. So that means we'll have plenty of room for some cha cha action everybody and bring

907
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:47,680
all the hookers. Okay. By the way, but when I was introing that song, I was thinking, what
