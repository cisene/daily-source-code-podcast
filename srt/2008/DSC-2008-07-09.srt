1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey there Adam, this is Roscoe from Lockjaw, Kentucky.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hey, I took your advice on a win-on line and looked up that hydroxy blaster.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I tell you what, Adam, I think I made a good one.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
To kick off the DSC 775, I got my hydroxy converter with a five gallon steel bucket.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yeah, I didn't want to miss around that little jar of the head on there.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And then I went ahead and, uh, so it wouldn't evaporate and so it wouldn't spill.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So I went ahead and, and soldered a lead on it.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And now I got some extra power running to it.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This thing is going to purr like a little pussycat.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
All right, Arlene, go ahead and fire it up.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's going to be great.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, I just turned it over fire it up.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You're less than an hour.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Aircraft from here will join others from around the world.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
mankind, that word should have new meaning for all of us today.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We will be united in our common interest.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Perhaps, it's fate that today is the 4th of July.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And you will once again be fighting for our freedom.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But from annihilation.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We're fighting for our right to live.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
To exist.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And should we win the day?

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But as the day might go quietly into the night,

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
we will not vanish without a fight.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We're going to live on.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We're going to survive.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Today, we celebrate our independence day.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We're 16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped by us.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In the next generation radio contenting my ears.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
For testing, he is very hurry.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
A famous middle-aged rock and roller call me last week.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The sank me for speaking out against the war.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Only to go on to tell me that he could not speak himself.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Because he fears repercussions.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Ministry kicking off, daily source code

Episode 775, watch yourself

147
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,600
We're gonna hold on, you're home

148
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,600
And that track, just about along with almost every other track

149
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,600
to end on today's program, source from the source code drop

150
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,600
at drop.io slash daily source code, everybody how you doing

151
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,600
It is hump day, addition of the source code, but of course

152
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,600
It's really the first one of the week, it's July 9th, 2008

153
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,600
The weather's been just absolutely horrendous for the past couple of days

154
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,600
In fact, today I was slated to travel to the Netherlands

155
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,600
to Amsterdam on some family business, not gonna happen

156
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Looking at the cloud layer, it's about 700 feet at the bottom

157
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,600
And about 10,000 feet at the top, in between it's just all crap

158
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,600
You know, like thunderstorms and hail and you name it

159
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
And the rain has just been almost torrential

160
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,600
It's really been just completely wet

161
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
So the good news, of course, is I'm here

162
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,600
And we can have a nice show together

163
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
I don't know if it's gonna be the only one this week

164
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
We'll talk about that in a second

165
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,600
But first of all, you've probably heard the news by now

166
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,600
If you read curry.com or if you follow along on anything

167
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,600
It's happening in Silicon Valley, we received a C

168
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Around a financing

169
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,600

170
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Yet again, a fantastic investment firm

171
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Particularly Kudos going out to Jim Feuer

172
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,600
who really helped us work this deal

173
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,600
And now I want you to understand that a C round, which is the third

174
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,600
And really the final stage of funding for any company

175
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
If you look at the trajectory

176
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Is really, it's not, you know, like investment money

177
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Well, maybe these guys have got some kind of idea

178
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,600
This is really based upon a business model that we've developed

179
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
And we really refined since our craft November

180
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Which probably explains a lot of my absence

181
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
During the week for the daily part of the DSC

182
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Because we've really been doing that

183
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Workin' hard day and night, getting it together

184
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Working with our board of directors, working with lots of people

185
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Who understand what we want to do

186
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
To understand a lot of these traditional models

187
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
And we really cracked it a few months ago

188
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
And so this money is really meant to put fuel onto the fire

189
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
So we can light this rocket and blow it off into the atmosphere

190
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Time, of course, with the trends we're seeing in the advertising world

191
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Where brand advertisers are ready, just pretty much to advertise

192
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Online video, real brand advertising

193
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
And they're just sick and tired of what the audiences are of television

194
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Which are diminishing

195
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
And be the content

196
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
So they're looking for relevance they're looking for reach

197
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
And we're seeing success with it

198
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,600
And I gotta tell you, it's been a very challenging and interesting time

199
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
To raise money for anything, I think

200
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,600
So, and of course I want to thank my partner

201
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Ron Bloom, who really put a lot of personal sacrifice

202
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Into this, you know, really raising the funds

203
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Doing a lot of the meetings by himself

204
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Or leading the teams

205
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
While also working with everyone to run the company

206
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
And make it work

207
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
And of course, major, major thanks

208
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
To all of our producers

209
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Independent, part of the media network

210
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,600
And without doubt, last and of course not least

211
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
The audience who really makes it all happen

212
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
And who keep showing up, time and time again

213
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,600
To watch and listen to our programming

214
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
So, you know, I should be really, really happy

215
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
And I just should be bouncing off the walls

216
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Of course, I am, but I'm extremely troubled

217
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
My fellow chuckleheads

218
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
I'm really concerned about what's going on

219
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
And, you know, the first thing we really need to do

220
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,600
We need to change the title of this program

221
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
From daily source code to something else

222
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Because the amount of time and research it takes

223
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
From me to really look at the conversations that we're talking about

224
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
And the things that are going on in the world

225
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
It's just, it's a lot of preparatory work

226
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
And sometimes it takes multiple days

227
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
In fact, I've been working on this show

228
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Except, of course, for the funding announcement

229
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
I've been working on it for almost four days

230
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
You know, parts of the weekend, deviated there

231
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
And, sorry, help me out

232
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Come up with something for the D

233
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
I mean, I do like the DSC

234
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
I like the Delta Sierra Charlie Aquarium

235
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
You know, I like the chuckleheads

236
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
But I think we need something different from the D

237
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Since clearly, daily is just, it's just not a possibility

238
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Not just from my own schedule and agenda

239
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
And other activities

240
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
But really, for the preparatory work

241
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
And there's a lot of reading, a lot of watching videos

242
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
And boy, I have learned so much, I feel

243
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,600
In many ways, enlightened in other ways

244
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
somewhat awakened by what's been going on

245
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,600
And what I've been able to follow and what I've learned

246
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
And hopefully you'll be able to help me

247
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Figure out some of the loose ends as we work on those together

248
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
So for the D, what would it be?

249
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Dirty source code, deadly source code, disaster source code

250
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
I want to hear from you

251
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Call in to the voice mail lines

252
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Which you're listed in the show

253
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
No, it's a daily source code.com

254
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
And of course, it's a curry.com

255
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
So what is happening in the world, man?

256
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Think things are crazy

257
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Here in the UK, we've had

258
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Multiple suicide packs of kids

259
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Throwing themselves in front of trains

260
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
And killing themselves

261
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,600
We've got increased activity of UFOs

262
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,600
The police helicopter chased one the other day

263
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Here in the UK, reported widely in mainstream media

264
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
We continue to have distractions on television

265
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Of Brittany, Lindsey, Paris, you name it

266
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,600
It seems like in a way we're awakening

267
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
We're becoming aware of things

268
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Things are happening around us

269
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,600
And the worldly powers that be are fighting it

270
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,600
I'm really not quite sure what it is

271
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,600
But I'd really like to work on it with you guys

272
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
To figure it out

273
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
And I've done some preparation on it

274
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
In today's Charlie, which is

275
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Wow, episode number 175

276
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,600
So first of all, I've been tracking oil prices

277
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
You know, this is almost a hobby of mine

278
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,600
In fact, today being Wednesday, 253 p.m.

279
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
In the United Kingdom, so British Standard Time

280
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,600
I saw oil go down yesterday drastically

281
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Down to like 135 dollars a barrel

282
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Which to me, man, something's up

283
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
You know, either there's

284
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,600
I mean, I just could not believe that this would be

285
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,600
You know, a gradual sloping off

286
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
It was down like four or five bucks all of a sudden

287
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Down into 135, 136 dollars a barrel

288
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,600
And low and behold, just as I thought this morning

289
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Word comes that Iran is testing missiles

290
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
And there's a rumbling in the Gulf

291
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
And of course, oil starts to pop up

292
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,600
It is now at 8.53 a.m. in New York

293
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Oil is almost up to two dollars a barrel

294
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,600
So there's clearly clearly things going on

295
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Clearly things that need to be brought to the forefront

296
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,600
And in particular, what is going on between the US and Iran

297
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
And we've been through this in previous shows

298
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,600
That Iran just never wanted to play game with the

299
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,600
With the dollar currency for oil

300
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
And they've threatened to flood the world markets with cheap oil

301
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
And based that trading upon the euro

302
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
And it seems like there's only a couple of ways to go

303
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
For our current United States administration

304
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
And you know what?

305
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Heck, I'll just bring in the UK administration as well

306
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,600
It's all the same thing

307
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
It seems like the only answer

308
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,600
The only solution is to come up with a reason to go to war

309
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
And then actually go and do it

310
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Do you feel the repeat?

311
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Is there deja vu happening in your mind

312
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
At all with the Iraq

313
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
One and two

314
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Well luckily we do have one solitary man in the US Senate

315
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Who is trying time and time again to point out the exact obvious

316
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Had you not heard this, Ron Paul on the Senate floor

317
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
I'd like you to take a listen

318
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
He talks about oil prices

319
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,600
And the disastrous, disastrous decisions

320
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,600
That are being made towards fellow men, women

321
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,600
All the majority of them under 30 years old in Iran

322
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
We must not go to war with this country

323
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Dow Jones average was down 350 some points

324
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Gold was up 32 dollars

325
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Oil was up another five dollars

326
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,600
And there's a lot of chaos out there

327
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Everybody's worried about four dollars a gallon gasoline

328
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
I don't think there's a clear understanding

329
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
It's actually why that has occurred

330
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,600
We do know that there's a supply in demand

331
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
There's a lot of demand for oil

332
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
The supplies may be dwindling

333
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,600
But there are other reasons for high cost of energy

334
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
One is inflation

335
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
For instance, to pay for the war that has been going on

336
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
And the domestic spending

337
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
We have been spending a lot more money than we have

338
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
So what do we do?

339
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
We send the bills over to the Federal Reserve

340
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
They create new money

341
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
In the last three years

342
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Our government through the Federal Reserve and our banking system

343
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Created four trillion dollars of new money

344
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,600
That is one of the main reasons why we have this high cost of energy

345
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
And four dollars a gallon gasoline

346
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,600
But there is another factor that I want to talk about tonight

347
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,600
And that is not only the fear of inflation and future inflation

348
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,600
But the fear factor dealing with our foreign policy

349
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
And in the last several weeks

350
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,600
If not for months now we have heard a lot of talk

351
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,600
About the potentiality of Israel

352
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,600
And or United States bombing Iran

353
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
And it's in the marketplace

354
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
It's being fed up

355
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
The energy prices are being fed up because of this fear

356
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,600
It has been predicted if bombs start dropping

357
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,600
You're going to see energy prices double or triple

358
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
It's just the thought of it right now

359
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,600
That helps to push these prices

360
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
The price of energy out

361
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,600
And that is a very real thing going on right now

362
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
But to me it's almost like Dejavu

363
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
All over again as it has been said

364
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,600
We listened to the rhetoric for years and years before we went into Iraq

365
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,600
We did not go in the correct manner

366
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,600
We did not declare war where there it's an endless struggle

367
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Where in Iran we're endlessly struggling there

368
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
And I cannot believe it

369
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,600
That we may well be on the verge of initiating bombing of Iran

370
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Leaders on both sides of the aisle

371
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Any administration that have all said so often

372
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,600
No options can be taken off the table

373
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Including a nuclear first strike on Iran

374
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
The fear is they say maybe someday

375
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
They're going to get a nuclear weapon

376
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Even though our own CIA and our NEI

377
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Says a national intelligence estimate has said they had not been working

378
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,600
The Iranians have not been working on a nuclear weapon since 2003

379
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
They say they're enriching uranium

380
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,600
But they have no evidence whatsoever that they're enriching uranium for weapons purposes

381
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,600
That they may well be enriching uranium for peaceful purposes

382
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
And that is perfectly legal

383
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,600
They have been a member of the non-proliferation treaties

384
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,600
And they are under the investigation of the IAA

385
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,600
And alberadai has verified that in the last year

386
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,600
There have been nine unannounced investigations

387
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,600
And examinations of Iranian nuclear structure

388
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,600
And they have never been found to be found in violation

389
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:01,600
And yet this country and Israel are talking about a preventive war

390
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Starting bombing for this reason without negotiation without talks

391
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Now the one issue that I do want to mention tonight is a resolution

392
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,600
That is about to come to this floor if our suspicions are correct

393
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
After the July 4th holiday

394
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
And this bill will probably be brought up under suspension

395
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
It'll be expected to be passed easily

396
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Probably will be and it's just more war propaganda

397
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,600
More preparation to go to war against Iran

398
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:42,600
And this resolution H.J. Res 62 is a virtual war resolution

399
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,600
It is the declaration of tremendous sanctions

400
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,600
And boycotts and embargoes on Iran is very, very severe

401
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Let me just read what is involved in this

402
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,600
If this bill passed and what we're telling the president he must do

403
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,600
This demands that the president impose stringent inspection requirements

404
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,600
And all persons, vehicles, ships, planes, trains and cargo

405
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Andring or departing Iran and prohibiting the international movement of all Iranian officials

406
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
I mean this is unbelievable

407
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,600
This is closing down Iran

408
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Where do we have this authority?

409
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Where do we get the moral authority?

410
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Where do we get the international legal authority for this?

411
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Where do we get the constitutional authority for this?

412
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,600
This is what we did for 10 years before we went into Iraq

413
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,600
We starved children 50,000 individuals

414
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,600
It was admitted probably died because of the sanctions on the Iraqis

415
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,600
They were incapable of the time of attacking us

416
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,600
And all the propaganda was given for our need to go into Iraq wasn't true

417
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,600
And it's not true today about the severity

418
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,600
They say yeah, but all my data job he's a bad guy

419
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,600
He's threatened violence, but you know what?

420
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Us threatening violence is very, very similar

421
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
We are must

422
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
We must look at this carefully

423
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,600
We just can't go to war at the end of the time

424
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
These violence, frivolous conditions

425
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Oh, I believe

426
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Let me tell you

427
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Man, it's been seven to one

428
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Time to tell me it's time

429
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,600
This administration is failed to do it

430
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
And now we have an urgent duty

431
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
We should do it now

432
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Do it well

433
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
It feels good, do it

434
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it

435
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:35,600
do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, rotate your body, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do

436
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,600
and our duty is fulfilled and service to one another

437
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,640
duty

438
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,000
that that also showed up on the source code drop do a do do do do do do do do

439
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,840
do do do do do do do do do do do oh yeah there you go it's almost like the good

440
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,980
forces versus the evil forces to old guys man oh man oh man I'm just so

441
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:22,620
concerned about this but you know as I search around more and as people more and

442
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,800
more people start tuning into to the show and start sending me links and

443
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,560
really turning me on to all different yeah all different types of

444
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,360
information just there is you know it's it's like this really haunting

445
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,240
feeling you know just like at the back of my neck where I'm thinking you know

446
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,120
could there actually be something to this whole illuminati story if you look

447
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,320
at you know the bloodlines if you look at the secret societies of

448
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,360
skull and bones you're there's so much information out there you know the

449
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,800
information that I've learned from the confessions of an economic hitman or the

450
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,600
the true inside stories behind the the CIA and legacy of ashes I mean

451
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,600
these are these are all books that we've discussed and hopefully you've

452
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,560
read them or you know if not find it you can even get audio book versions you

453
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:15,520
know don't even have to use use your eyes I'm thinking there's this huge

454
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,760
mountain that is just in right in front of us that that we we haven't even

455
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,640
seen you know we're looking at little a little other obstacles like towers

456
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,760
and stuff we want to dart around and don't want to fly into but the huge

457
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,480
mountain has been there and it's been growing and it's becoming ever

458
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,200
increasing in size and it's really starting to well piss me off first of all

459
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,880
but man you know this like these the talks of well here's here's something

460
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,960
that showed up on the daily source code drop okay you have to read this

461
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,680
PDF I don't really know if it's you know what the authenticity is but it

462
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,560
really does make a lot of sense having read through it although I'm no

463
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,400
mathematician which is of course part of the plan is not to have smart kids but

464
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,200
just from an economic standpoint this document which was found many many

465
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,080
years ago by accident and it's basically a manual if you will for controlling

466
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,360
an automating a population or if you will the world it's called silent weapons

467
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,320
for quiet wars and you'll find at drop dot IOS slash daily source code

468
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,480
give this thing read because even if it's not authentic man the whole theories

469
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,880
behind it are scary enough and the basic principle is it's equating the way

470
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,040
to control people and the money in an economy to one or a few people's

471
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,480
benefit they've equated it down to a science that is on on par with

472
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:47,280
electricity using conductors resistors switches volts and amps and and

473
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,160
equating each of those pieces to very basic things like inflationary rates

474
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:59,560
or the price of oil all things which as we know are under control of definitely

475
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,360
a few people I mean certainly interest rates is is completely under control of

476
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,520
the central banks and inflation is under control of institutions like the

477
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,240
Federal Reserve by printing more money you can create and create inflation and

478
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,320
when you read this document it is literally a blueprint on if not a blueprint on

479
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,920
how to control maybe on the way that we've been controlled expanding and

480
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,800
contracting the economy and making a profit on each expansion and each

481
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,680
contraction and doing that on lower levels with poor countries I mean this

482
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,520
comes right back to the confessions of an economic hitman it's really it's

483
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,800
really crazy but when you just sit back and chill out and think about it because

484
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,160
you know the first immediate thought is I know a man that can't be true

485
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,800
you always think people can't be as evil as as they're made out to be

486
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,960
certainly on the just plethora of sites that you can find on the internet and I'm

487
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,920
not talking 9-1 one stuff that's just a small little piece of the entire plan

488
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,840
if there is one and let's just say for argument sake that there is man if

489
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,240
there is there's a lot of coincidence going on and coincidence of facts and in

490
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:16,840
many cases basic laws of nature and laws of free markets it's in a way it's

491
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,600
disturbing but in another way it's really exciting because starting to be

492
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,040
able to figure all this stuff out means to me that well if it's just basic

493
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,520
physics and it's putting circuits together and increasing things here and

494
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,040
there you can inject an antidote you absolutely can make something different

495
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:42,120
and it's going to happen through all of us in fact I've read many cases that

496
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,120
the theory is should the people awake and should we become aware just aware

497
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,400
of what's going on but even that little bit of motion and commotion which

498
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,480
doesn't have to be a huge amount will basically shed off all of the evil powers

499
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,560
very akin to a dog who's wet and just kind of ruffles himself and throws off

500
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:07,560
all the water droplets to one by one we've got to start waking up thinking about it

501
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:47,320
we don't want no one no more bring our boys home to our shows we don't want big

502
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:54,000
government for the build the book proof that place all with you you don't have

503
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
your

504
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,000
we haven't followed the constitution and that's what we are to be doing

505
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
the system we have they are ripping off the middle class

506
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
and you imagine how the nation would have if we didn't have the federal reserve system

507
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
printing on this money

508
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:34,000
if you haven't seen the video have a look you'll find that on youtube run

509
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Paul the revolution song and there's a couple of cool things coming up centered

510
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
around the republican convention which will be in there was a Minneapolis in

511
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
there but they're also going to do some big stuff and I've been asked to get involved

512
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
and I am trying to change around a couple of things to actually accommodate them

513
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
so that should be pretty cool anyway back to the topic at hand there's just crazy

514
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
shit going on particularly here in the UK this is I got a couple of really nutty

515
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,000
new stories here check this out this is from the telegraph and this is from actually

516
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
from a couple weeks back I hadn't heard anything about it as is often the case of course

517
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
in the mainstream media there might be a little bit of news popping up and then

518
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
usually drops off the radar when there's another

519
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
written speakers episode

520
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
a quarter of the adult population in the UK faces an anti-pedophile test

521
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
in an escalation of child protection policies according to a report check this

522
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
the launch of a new government agency

523
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
which goes unnamed in this will see eleven point three million people in the UK

524
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
vetted for any criminal past before they are proved to have contact with children

525
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
aged under sixteen

526
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
vetted for any criminal past any criminal past

527
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
the increase in child protection measures is so great it is poisoning relationships

528
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
between the generations according to respected sociologists professor Frank for

529
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
the yeah hell yeah professor Frank hell yeah

530
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
in a report for think tank civitas which I don't know anything about

531
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
he said the use of criminal records breaks checks of the criminal records bureau checks to ensure

532
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
the safety of children and vulnerable adults has created an atmosphere of suspicion

533
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
yet no shit

534
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
so let me see the checks were introduced to tighten procedures to protect children

535
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
after school caretaker e-in-huntly murdered ten-year-old Jessica Chapman and

536
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
holly wells and so on and two thousand two

537
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
well of course that's horrible and of course we want to

538
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
you know make sure that this doesn't happen but come on I mean

539
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
parents apparently will even be checked

540
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
to be in contact with their own kids

541
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
this is this is just taking things a little bit too far

542
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'll put a link in the show notes to this one and

543
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
podcast Paul park is actually sent me something as well which I can't

544
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
seem to find at the moment you know the you've probably seen the videos on youtube

545
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I think voing or wired even pointed to one not too long ago

546
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
where someone's filming something in London and then a couple come up and say

547
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
you know it's illegal you're not allowed to film this building and of course

548
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
it's perfectly legal and if you're on public property you can film

549
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
whatever you want and well that's changing now and this is what I'm trying to find

550
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
but I guess I shouldn't and I must have thrown it away or done something

551
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
with it let me see

552
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
now

553
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
anyway the just of the article was that a change in the law is being proposed

554
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
where the constable in question that would be the police officer on duty

555
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
at his or her discretion can stop filming based upon the situation at hand

556
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
so all of a sudden now you know even though there's millions of cameras in the UK

557
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
and by the way this isn't just a UK thing in the US have a look around

558
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
millions of cameras watching our every move we're not allowed to film anything

559
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
not even in public spaces anymore or we're allowed to but at the discretion of the

560
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
constable on duty in the situation at hand they'll be able they will have the authority

561
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
to say no you cannot film I mean this is uh this is not good

562
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
no no in fact this sucks

563
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
it sucks

564
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
hey Kerry

565
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
hey Ross

566
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
thank you with the legary church colon said about fathers not having the ability to bitch and moan

567
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
about what goes on and I think he's absolutely right for the following reasons

568
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
and the primary one is that we do have ways of enacting our will

569
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I mean voting is just one small aspect of the whole thing

570
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I mean we actually have to tell our representatives what the fuck we actually want

571
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
you know and I think the term settlement majority really sums it up

572
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
that the majority of the people don't say anything

573
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
and I mean what are there representatives for some think of this

574
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
that I mean there's only two conclusions that either people are supportive of it

575
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
or that people don't give a deal

576
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and if these minority groups special interest groups these lobbyists you know can affect

577
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
them then I think that we the majority can certainly have a bigger effect on them

578
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
you know take this and run loophole for example there are lobbyists right now saying that

579
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
this is going to affect the free market economy and I'm like well this is true

580
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
but oil is infrastructure dude and infrastructure as far as I'm concerned should be regulated

581
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and considering you guys these lobbyists are basically representing people already

582
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
natively influencing the system and manipulating the free market so it's no longer free

583
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
then you know I think we have very right to backlash that

584
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
you know especially with these high bloody oil prices

585
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
so yeah I think that's what we need to do a chucklehead you know we need to get off

586
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
our assets opting silent and actually start the voicing our opinion

587
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
who knows maybe we actually might just get something done then

588
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
but that's my two cents let's get the ball rolling on this conversation

589
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
there we go great air hope you win

590
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
love you a minute we got one on the week

591
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm going to go for more as we progress and they work for us

592
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
but only when we tell them what to do that's the head let's start telling

593
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
peace head on over to the source code drop man take a look at that PDF silent weapons

594
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
for quiet wars and just read it I mean forget the diagrams and all the circuitry and all that

595
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
you don't actually need to know that the calculations although I'm hopeful that there's a chucklehead

596
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
out there or perhaps someone of the savants status who can actually help us

597
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
decode some of these some of these equations that see if it literally is that simple

598
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and if we can understand how the blueprint works how all the details are put together

599
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
then of course we can jam the machine right so it's not going to take it's not going to take a

600
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
typical type of revolution I don't think I think that as long as we all start off

601
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
with an awakening and start seeing what's happening and and start coming out of the numbness

602
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
that we've been just beat over the head with for decades now particularly was coming out

603
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
that box in the corner of your living room or these days you've got your tuna right in your

604
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
built into your computer I mean that's that's the thing we've got to look out for

605
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I would say got to be very careful so for all the UK chuckleheads I've got a nice little

606
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
UK protest song for you I thought you'd appreciate

607
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
investment in that so far because he takes us all he's a Texas man to the hungry

608
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
drives the Lexus fans you don't need them big the shins for the show but all the

609
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:40,000
people are not so safe and we are going to bring the wreck

610
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:52,000
do I think too much can we hear you all night still give a fuck tell you I don't

611
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
wave the flag because we're arrogant enough don't need to black go on

612
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
pace in the forks facing away facing career because we're friends with the states

613
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
little we are going to face be a face how we from corporations is a big disgrace

614
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
don't forget walk up on the walls where we all go report it reflects on us

615
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
best in on the beach say in the club loud up great say in the English pop man

616
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I'm amazed that we still get a lot more punch in the world with American clubs

617
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
come tell to rant animal waves and we've come back up is a low play those are real men

618
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
don't forget locked up no charge for using count I'm a pressure ain't really

619
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
man because you're idiot what's on a kid your jokes and you're idiot what's on a kid

620
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
your jokes and the good DJs get night times lost it's a load of crap like

621
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
planes made them too tough to like that straight down your back when we're old

622
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
who great kids will be like mom that trolley push cold enemy

623
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
take away no police these days those will kill Kennedy

624
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
call us the remedy this was about energy supply

625
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
the word about terror has to go down high and it's even been proved

626
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
that lead is right in the world terrors racism in disguise and we still don't

627
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
vote when for it is time and we have to

628
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
stay to this point because the new deal is the double

629
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:04,000
to avoid them this war is based on the past

630
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
from these to Z from the first to the law this was based on the past

631
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
the law the law the law the law the law the law the law the law

632
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
the law the court the första that

633
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
well men how I wish i knew who are done this track I just showed up on the

634
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,200
Drop it's showed up as Seriana and Stiles.

635
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,920
So I guess it's the performer as Seriana and I, or maybe it's Seriana style.

636
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,920
I don't know.

637
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,400
May you guys, you got to put more data into those things when you drop it.

638
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,680
Drop.io slash daily source code.

639
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,240
That's we can always find all that's really become such an intricate part of the show.

640
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,240
I'm so, it's so cool.

641
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,040
I almost want to figure out how to flow some of that over into curry.com or even

642
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,800
daily source code.com or whatever the D will stand for in the future.

643
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,600
Don't forget to help me out, give us a call, send me an email, give me some ideas

644
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,800
where what can we do with the D?

645
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,800
Let me see, we could do, you want to do one more, one more heavy thing here.

646
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,800
I've got some about fluoride, which is really pretty cool, although.

647
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,800
Let's just do something completely stupid for them.

648
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,800
Well, let's not call it stupid.

649
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,800
Let's call it a little bit of entertainment distraction because we do need to have a balance

650
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,800
in our diet today.

651
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,800
Don't you agree?

652
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
Don't you agree?

653
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,800
I'm ready for your test.

654
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,800
Get it, test.

655
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
Young boldness!

656
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
Hey Adam, how are you doing?

657
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
I am doing good, man.

658
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,800
This is hit test number one, two, nine are.

659
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
It's not right away with a drone.

660
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,800
Number one.

661
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,800
It sounds like maybe it's a depression mode or an ABC.

662
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,800
Maybe it's older than that.

663
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
Maybe it's early, eighties.

664
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,800
Number two.

665
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,800
That actually sounds like ABC.

666
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,800
Oh, man, I'm stuck in today.

667
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,800
It's all right.

668
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,800
As long as we're all entertained.

669
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,800
And the final one is number three.

670
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:33,800
I'm literally sitting here with my eyes closed and I'm realizing, once again, I'm failing on all three.

671
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,800
I can't do it.

672
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,800
I'm stopping all of these weekend answers are from 85.

673
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,800
85, huh?

674
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,800
As soon.

675
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,800
Answer number one.

676
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,800
What is this?

677
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,800
This is tremendous.

678
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,800
All down.

679
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,800
I never would have known.

680
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,800
I was into Duran Duran at the time.

681
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,800
I never can even sing along with a song.

682
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,800
Hey.

683
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,800
Oh, man.

684
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,800
Oh, man.

685
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,800
Oh, man.

686
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,800
Oh, man.

687
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,800
Oh, man.

688
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
Oh, man.

689
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,800
It's for me, in his answer number one.

690
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,800
And this is answer number two.

691
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,800
Renee and Angela.

692
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,800
Man.

693
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,800
You're not.

694
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,800
You're not.

695
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,800
I don't know any of these tracks.

696
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
Oh, man.

697
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,800
Oh, man.

698
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,800
Oh, man.

699
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,800
Oh, man.

700
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,800
Oh, man.

701
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,800
Okay.

702
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
I kind of recognize it now.

703
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
Again.

704
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,800
I must have been listening to ultra-box or something.

705
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,800
1985.

706
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
What the hell was I doing?

707
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,800
I wasn't paying attention.

708
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,800
Were these like, even in the top 20?

709
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
Answer number two.

710
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,800
Renee and Angela and I'll be good.

711
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
And this is answer number three.

712
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
Long time no see.

713
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,800
I don't know this one either.

714
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,800
You haven't little time.

715
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
Just spend it with me.

716
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,800
Okay.

717
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,800
I got it.

718
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,800
Yeah.

719
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,800
What was this again?

720
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,800
I mean.

721
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,800
Is that a loop?

722
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,800
Time to say.

723
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,800
Baby.

724
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,800
Oh, man.

725
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,800
Oh, man.

726
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,800
Oh, man.

727
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,800
Oh, time.

728
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,800
Answer number three.

729
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,800
Freddie Jackson.

730
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,800
Freddie.

731
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,800
Yeah.

732
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,800
I mean tonight the net concludes.

733
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,800
Hit the number 100.

734
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,800
Oh, yeah.

735
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,800
Well.

736
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,800
So I didn't have to do this week.

737
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,800
I stuck John.

738
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,800
So let that be a birthday present for you.

739
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,800
Happy birthday, by the way.

740
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,800
I got none right.

741
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,800
You stumped me completely.

742
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,800
As always, the answers to this hit this are to be found.

743
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,800
Hit this.

744
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,800
That's not me.

745
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,800
That's all sort of place to find.

746
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,800
The iTunes links.

747
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,800
So you can buy the tracks featured on the hit this online.

748
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,800
And I'm thinking for playing again.

749
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,800
Yeah, sure.

750
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,800
Everyone else.

751
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,800
Thanks for listening.

752
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,800
Next week, I'll be back for hit this number 130.

753
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,800
So until then, take care.

754
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,800
Have fun.

755
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,800
And remember.

756
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,800
Think with your heart.

757
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,800
Bye-bye.

758
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,800

769
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,800
Hi, Adam.

770
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,800
It's Matt from Gamesweasel.

771
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,800
On this week's show, we reviewed Battlefield Bad Company on the Xbox 360.

772
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,800
We play Okumi on the Wii.

773
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,800
We've also got some info about the new NASCAR-09 game from the drivers themselves.

774
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,800
And you can win copies of Unreal Tournament 3 for the Xbox 360.

775
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,800
That's all at Gamesweasel.com.

776
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,800
Hey, I'm big man's back.

777
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,800
WWE that the kit from Brooklyn.com.

778
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:50,800
I was watching the Larry King show the other night yet on one of these big oil executives.

779
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,800
His name was O'Reilly.

780
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,800
He's telling Larry King that the oil companies are making that much profit.

781
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,800
But Larry King, he don't dig into the game.

782
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,800
What about the $40, $50 million a year salary of getting Mr. O'Reilly?

783
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,800
Who pays for that?

784
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,800
The fucking American people.

785
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,800
I mean, who?

786
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,800
Who deserves that fucking kind of money?

787
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,800
$40, $50 million a year.

788
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,800
To all these big oil executives out there.

789
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,800
And they're claiming they ain't making those fucking money.

790
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,800
What does he grow taller than a fat fucking cop on a quality of fucking red batches?

791
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,800
Who loves fucking kids?

792
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,800
You're making fucking videos of dollars and a working man in his fucking country.

793
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,800
Got a fucking shop.

794
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,800
You, bad batches are making a work in land today.

795
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,800
He can't even go out and buy food and pay for shelters for his fucking family.

796
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,800
But it's all right.

797
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,800
It's all right.

798
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,800
But then big oil executives can get $40, $50 million a year salary.

799
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,800
That's okay.

800
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,800
But the average Joe King can't even afford the biggest fucking family.

801
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,800
I'm telling you, it's gonna be a rebel bullshit in his fucking country.

802
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,800
He might've got to take this shit no more.

803
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,800
I mean, how many times are he going to get kicked in a fucking face

804
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,800
before you kick fucking back?

805
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,800
I mean, come on, give us a fucking rate.

806
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,800
What a fucking salary.

807
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,800
What's the matter?

808
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,800
Who the $1,0, for fucking oil executives in today?

809
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,800
They got to be $40,000,000.

810
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,800
Go fucking a showship breed.

811
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,800
Breakfast, fucking batches.

812
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,800
Anyway.

813
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
They come party.

814
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,800
This is something man.

815
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,800
The rice.

816
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,800
The rice.

817
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,800
Shut up.

818
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,800
People.

819
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,800
You're a pile of fake clothes.

820
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,800
I hope you're screwed up.

821
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,800
Fuck you.

822
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,800
Nothing.

823
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,800
You ran.

824
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,800
Passen.

825
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,800
Ha.

826
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,800
Ha.

827
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,800
But this.

828
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,800
This.

829
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,800
You think it will be so screw.

830
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,800
I'm going.

831
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,800
I'm going.

832
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,800
Yeah.

833
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,800
Shit.

834
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,800
Out.

835
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,800
It's.

836
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,800
Hey.

837
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,800
I'm.

838
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,800
Repeat.

839
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,800
Hold on.

840
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,800
I'm.

841
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,800
I'm.

842
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,800
I'm sure.

843
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,800
I'm.

844
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,800
I'm.

845
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,800
I'm.

846
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,800
I'm.

847
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,800
I'm.

848
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,800
I'm.

849
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,800
I'm.

850
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,800
I'm.

851
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,800
I'm.

852
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,800
30 pack a straw 30 pack a no rogue ain't in the pro pay for

853
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,800
He's in charge in one half the living proof with a gift from the city of truth

854
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:57,800
I challenge that and not critics back and I did not start it when I said that

855
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:02,800
I'm going back no selling rhymes I went back no seven times

856
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:08,800
He's still the ill they want to see us ride I guess because the only god knows why

857
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,800
Why why why why why

858
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,800
They call me powerful I have a single reply from someone bigger with the air

859
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,800

I'm giving it back to say hey hey hey hey hey hey

862
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,800
So be so bad to say hey hey hey hey hey

863
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,800
Let me hear where you're at, say hey hey hey

864
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,800
I like ACC, the ACC time will see this piece

865
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,800
These are the kings of rock Scanner, see your lip on the storm

866
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,800
Pay me an alley go with no show, show

867

Yeah, that's that bottle of rock got the rock for Detroit

868
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,800
So for both out the art and the crowd of soul

869
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,800
Need a deal with tracks that make us that back the rock

870

I'm giving it back to say hey hey hey hey

880
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,800
So be so bad to say hey hey hey hey

881
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,800
Yeah, I saw your band

You can roll with rock, you're a comedian

887
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,800
I'm a porno, blast, I'm like amazing crazy

888
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,800
I'm gonna, some, let go of rock, this place

889
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,800
I'm super blind, it's a double white sight

890
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,800
Call my eyes, it's so deep

891
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,800
Big five, ball, fat, you share, bring it flat, you play

892
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,800
Got the longest, wing it middle, wing it, no, wing it

893
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,800
Big six, big six, big five, you're fair, see me by, see

00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,800
In a rebel, get her, ball, lift it down

895
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,800
So we're new, do, get the next generation of things

896
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,800
Who knew, I'd throw a black, I'd walk, walk, walk

897
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,800
Check on that school, fall, the mind, the blow, fall

898
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,800
Spell the old, blow, walk, check my head

899
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,800
So I don't wanna stay in here, rush out there

900
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,800
Call my eyes, it's so deep

901
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,800
Call my eyes, it's so deep

902
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,800
I'm gonna, make a witty edge, see me by your back

903
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,800
Say, hey, hey, hey, hey, say me, hey, say me

904
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,800
It's so deep, it's so deep, it's so deep

905
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,800
Say, hey, hey, hey, hey

906
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:21,800
I'm not a god, hold me, I'll let that escalate

907
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,800
I'm singing baby, baby, baby

908
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,340
Don't fight inside the box, don't fight the back

909
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,800
Say baby, baby, baby

910
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,800
I want you to try singing back, don't fight the back

911
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,800
I'm singing baby, baby, baby

912
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,800
I'm singing back, don't fight the back

913
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,800
Don't fight the back, don't fight the back

914
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,800
I'm singing back, don't fight the back

915
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,800
Hell yeah, American badass

916
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,800
Kid Rock shows it can be done

917
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,800
Turn some of that energy towards

918
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,800
You know who?

919
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:57,800
All right, so in my continuing search and research

920
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:05,800
You know, and again, I'm just, I kind of tend to stay away from a lot of the real, you know, like the occultish

921
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,800
And believe me, I've read it all, you feel free to send me links

922
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,800
But I've read all about the stuff about eating babies

923
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,800
And et cetera, et cetera

924
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,800
I think I've read just about every single conspiracy theory that is out there

925
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:26,800
Until I come across something that has been poking at the back of my mind for a number of years now

926
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,800
People have sent me messages and I don't really quite tuned into it

927
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,800
Because it's like, this is some kind of spiritual conspiracy theory

928
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,800
By the way, the conspiracy theory is just a theory

929
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,800
It's a theory about a conspiracy

930
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,800
It's nothing bad, you're not in a conspiracy when you're looking at a theory

931
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,800
So this is research is what I could consider it

932
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:52,800
And, you know, people often laugh at people who say, you know, things that seem extraordinarily out of the ordinary

933
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,800
Or just extraordinary, I should say

934
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,800
I bumped into one of those debates

935
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,800
I think was the CNN slash YouTube

936
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,800
Where was it?

937
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,800
Can't remember who asked the question

938
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,800
But it was said to Dennis Cassinage, who was a democratic

939
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:17,800
No, not not many, but he was running for the democratic ticket

940
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,800
And, you know, this is the guy who's got the really hot wife

941
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,800
So Dennis Cassinage, you know, is it true?

942
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,800
It's like his mother-in-law or his aunt or something

943
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,800
It's surely McLean, and the question was, it was Tim Russell

944
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,800
Actually, that's what it was

945
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,800
You know, you claimed to have seen a UFO, and of course everyone's chuckling

946
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:43,800
And man Obama really slaughtered him when Obama had to answer the question about UFOs

947
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,800
But, you know, people laugh at people like that

948
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,800
And it's, you know, as I said, there's lots of activity going on

949
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,800
And, you know, so I run into things like the, how was the name of it?

950
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,800
Not the, not the demo, there's something project

951
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:04,800
Anyway, it's from 2000 and 2001, I think, may of 2001 for the National Press Club

952
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,800
All of these airmen, excuse me

953
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:17,800
Air traffic controllers, pilots, people will throw work in, you know, top, top secret high security clearance

954
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:23,800
Positions within the government, all sane, hey man, you know, we've had contact with, you know, not just contact

955
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,800
We've flown their aircraft and the government hasn't been telling this

956
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,800
And there's all kinds of reasons for it

957
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:33,800
And one of them, of course, you eventually get around to the story about Niburu

958
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,800
Or planet X as it's also known

959
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:42,800
And this partially has to do with, you know, the, the Mayan calendar apparently

960
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,800
And I'm just going to try and relate the stories I've understood it so far

961
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,800
The Mayan calendar, the Mayans were very, very smart, ends in 2012

962
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,800
Which is when in the, in astrology

963
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,800
We move into the age of Aquarius

964
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,800
And I do believe that actually the planets are all lined up in a particular order

965
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:06,800
And this is also the time, in fact, it is going to be the 21st of December 2012

966
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:11,800
Which is, you can just Google 2012 and you'll find out about this instantly

967
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,800
All the, all the links on the pages are about this

968
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,800
So here's the theory, there was a planet Niburu

969
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,800
Which actually I believe by itself, by colliding into Saturn or something like that

970
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,800
Actually created the earth

971
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,800
Was in deep trouble and that we're talking 500, you know, 1,000 years ago

972
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,800
Maybe 500 million years ago, no, 500, I don't even know

973
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,800
A long time ago

974
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,800
And by the way, this is all documented in the Sumerian tablets

975
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,800
In the translation there of that is the Sumeria, which is now known as Iraq

976
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,800
There, and this is known fact in the, in the Museum in Baghdad before it got bombed

977
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:53,800
As I think I've heard somewhere, I remember reading a quote or hearing a quote of saying

978
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,800
Someone in the armed forces, or maybe it was probably some of the idiot general who said

979
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,800
Man, they got a lot of pottery over there

980
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,800
Well, of course the pottery was like, you know, artifacts from 5,000 years ago

981
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,800
It's well known that civilization more or less started in that region

982
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:14,800
And so the theory goes that there's these intelligent beings on the planet Niburu

983
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:20,800
Which only crosses the earth's path, every 3,000 or 3600 years or maybe it's 30,000 years

984
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,800
It's kind of irrelevant, but it's in some form of weird orbit

985
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,800
And it's supposed to be coming by again in 2012

986
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,800
So with these guys they initially, when they had some problems with their own planet Niburu

987
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,800
Mainly their atmosphere was all screwed up

988
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,800
And they needed gold in order to sprinkle that into their atmosphere to protect them from whatever rays

989
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,800
Or, you know, because they were acts as a reflectant or protective shield

990
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,800
And so they decided to

991
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,800
Mind this on this planet, which was planet earth

992
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,800
And of course we were kind of crawling around

993
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,800
So we kind of existed, but not really

994
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,800
This is where the missing link theory kind of comes from

995
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:59,800
So what they decided to do was to create a whole world of minors of workers

996
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:04,800
Slaze essentially who would mind this gold and then they would be able to save their own planet

997
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:10,800
So they created a hybrid and the hybrid that created was 80% of us, you know, web feed

998
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,800
Walking around like idiots

999
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:17,800
And 20% of their DNA and there's all kinds of theories about that's how you get the double helix

1000
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:22,800
The twisted DNA representation

1001
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:27,800
And that 20% is actually of highly intelligent beings

1002
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,800
Who are based on light and love

1003
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,800
So you're going to start to see a lot of similarities with

1004
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,800
Almost every religion, every story

1005
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:41,800
The numbers come back like 12 disciples, you know, the Jesus being number 13

1006
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,800
And number 13 actually being a very good and lucky number instead of unlucky

1007
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,800
And you kind of see that things are all turned upside down on their head

1008
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,800
Because what happened is, and again, I'm really sketchy on the details here

1009
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,800
So boom, they created us a self-reproducing

1010
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,800
I believe actually the fact that I've read this theory that the fact that women have pain

1011
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,800
And labor was actually a mistake in the construction of how they put us together

1012
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,800
These intelligent beings

1013
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:16,800
And through the years, you know, we started to morph and this is where all the stories of, you know, giants

1014
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,800
And goal of our travels come from

1015
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:25,800
Again, I'm just paraphrasing don't take my word for, do your own research, read the story

1016
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:30,800
So as this continues through thousands and tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of years

1017
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,800
We also start to develop that 20% and we start to become enlightened

1018
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,800
And we start to develop technology and we start to become a lot smarter

1019
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:43,800
However, the guards, the fallen angels, I believe they call it

1020
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:52,800
Who essentially want to keep or are supposed to keep, I guess, this minors, union of slaves, a global planet of slaves

1021
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:57,800
Mining for gold, which by the way, we do see defined gold is pretty important, not quite sure why

1022
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,800
But, you know, there could be an explanation

1023
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,800
And they want to, and you know, they've also evolved

1024
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:10,800
And, you know, they're all about not evolving into an enlightened being where it's all about spirituality

1025
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,800
They want to keep it in the carbon being and the way they do that is through suppression

1026
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:21,800
And by enslaving the entire population because with them, it's all about the possessions and the money

1027
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,800
It's at tre, and they want to keep that gig going because hey, it's kind of a good gig, I guess

1028
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:31,800
If you look at it from there, it's perspective, where if, which, of course, anyone who, you know, can send off, can create wars for profit

1029
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:37,800
Which is what wars are all about is obviously has a very distorted reality field view

1030
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:45,800
So anyway, so in 2012, the Nibru is supposed to come back and they're going to check up on us

1031
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:51,800
And I guess this is why, you know, the evil forces on earth

1032
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,800
Who are all connected to royalty, so legend goes

1033
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:04,800
In fact, I've read that 34 of the 42 US presidents all have bloodline connections back to royalty up to, well, even the Queen of England

1034
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:12,800
And don't forget those oranges, the Queen of the Netherlands, who's husband Prince Bernard started the Builderberg group

1035
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:17,800
So you see how all these things start to kind of fit together and

1036
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:27,800
And they, you know, they're building, and this is well documented, they're building all kinds of electronic shields, which, you know, how about star wars, you know, what could that be for?

1037
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:32,800
And this is where the conspiracies, the plot really thickens in the conspiracy and the theory of it

1038
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:38,800
They want to keep the Nibru out, they don't want to come and help us through the age of Aquarius

1039
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,800
They want to help us into that dawning

1040
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:47,800
And at the same time, they're going to control us through mind control, which, of course, is already working very successfully

1041
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:55,800
By essentially tweaking the economy around us, so making oil very expensive

1042
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:00,800
Or then, you know, giving and helping us, being flush with cast or we can build up all kinds of debt

1043
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,800
And then taking it away, that's the expansion and contraction as I talked about

1044
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,800
What's really interesting though, is talking to Patricia about this

1045
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:10,800
And she said, oh yeah, well, this is what, you know, this is what the hippies were talking about all the time

1046
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,800
In fact, I picked up the song

1047
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,800
Well, maybe I will play the whole thing because

1048
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:21,800
When you listen to it, the dawning of the age of Aquarius from the musical hair

1049
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:25,800
This is about what is supposed to happen in 2012

1050
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,800
And they were singing about this in the 60s and 70s

1051
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:58,800
And now watch it listen to the lyrics, okay?

1052
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:04,800
Because it's really all about what is supposed to come

1053
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:11,800
Harmony and understanding

1054
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:21,800
Timothy and trust of all

1055
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,800
The mind is true liberations

1056
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:31,800
So it kind of supports the whole theory, you know, and back in the day Patricia was a part of that

1057
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,800
It's, you know, she has the age for it

1058
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,800
It's just they were maybe a little bit too early

1059
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:39,800
And didn't have the internet and couldn't communicate that well amongst themselves

1060
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,800
I think they had some good dope dope

1061
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,800
Let's listen to it again

1062
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:06,800
So it seems like that's, you know, after you peel away all the layers of the onion

1063
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:13,800
Such as 9-11, which I'm pretty convinced we certainly need to get a whole bunch more answers on what happened there

1064
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,800
I mean, if you've seen any of the most recent videos

1065
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:22,800
And if you think you've seen them, if you watch them in 2003 or 2004, go back and go look again

1066
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,800
And go look at YouTube or Google video because there's a lot more evidence out there

1067
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,800
I'd also like you to take a look at pilots for 9-11 Truth.com

1068
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,800
I think it's.com.org

1069
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:40,800
Man, if you're into flying and you actually see the details as provided by the NTSB and the FAA and the NSA

1070
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,800
I think even of the black box contents and of the data that's coming out of the flight recorder

1071
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:51,800
You will be amazed at how many complete loose ends there are

1072
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,800
And just, you know, the multitude of questions

1073
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:00,800
You know, it's too technical to go into here, but man, just check it out

1074
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:06,800
But this whole idea of the kind of the space thing, I gotta tell you, I'm kind of into it

1075
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:14,800
And a lot of things start to click in the place, you know, is the suppression

1076
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:19,800
But then again, the enlightenment, something, you know, just being around the corner

1077
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:23,800
And everywhere you see on the internet, people were tuning into this idea

1078
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:29,800
You know, about waking up and coming out of your sleep and that it's built into our DNA

1079
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:35,800
And we've evolved and we're kind of in this race for the next four years, you know, four or five years

1080
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:43,800
Are we going to enlighten into beings that find intellectual, being intellectual and love and find power from light

1081
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:48,800
Is that, is that actually, you know, what's going to happen or the dark evil forces take over

1082
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:53,800
And every, you know, my question is, well, what should we do? What can we do?

1083
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:58,800
And every single answer I get is just start to wake up and help others to wake up

1084
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:04,800
And then it will happen all by itself. I don't even think there's going to be any kind of huge physical

1085
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:09,800
Revolution that's going to be needed because of the power and that's part of it

1086
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:15,800
I think that's part of our mission. Do I sound spacey to you because I certainly feel it that way

1087
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:20,800
But I've never seen a UFO in my life. I've never seen aliens pickled in a jar or anything like that

1088
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:25,800
But I know I saw an engine that wasn't from our terrestrial technology

1089
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,800
If the government has really been in contact with superior alien

1090
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,800
Wouldn't we see some evidence of it

1091
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,800
There has been a monumental cover up

1092
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,800
Your government knew we were dealing with extraterrestrial intelligence

1093
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,800
And as you probably know we have indeed retrieved crash-tardware

1094
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:14,800
And we have reverse engineered it and we have indeed been flying some of that hardware

1095
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,800
And this base is not too good to any miles outside of Nellus

1096
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,800
The town's a ground control

1097
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,800
I'm standing through the door

1098
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:59,800
And I'm floating in the most peculiar way

1099
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:07,800
And the stars look very different today

1100
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:14,800
For here my sitting in the temple

1101
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:21,800
Far, far, far

1102
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:29,800
When it's on this blue and there's nothing I can do

1103
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:37,800
The first and most famous alleged contact was the Roswell flying saucer crash of 1947

1104
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:43,800
A fascinating government official is warning we may be on the verge of intergalactic war

1105
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:49,800
Saying quote, the Bush administration has finally agreed to let the military build a forward base on the moon

1106
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:54,800
To put them in a better position to keep track of the comings and goings of visitors from space

1107
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,800
And to shoot at them if they so decide

1108
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:06,800
One bus one hundred thousand miles of really very soon

1109
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:14,800
And I think my space just knows which way to go

1110
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:21,800
Till my white line of hope very much now

1111
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:28,800
Clouds control to reach a time when your sun gets lit

1112
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,800
The sun glink on and you'll be on my reach a time

1113
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,800
Can you feel my reach a time?

1114
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,800
Can you feel my reach a time?

1115
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,800
Can you?

1116
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,800
I'm my project manager again

1117
01:10:47,800 --> 01:11:09,800
The US government is playing host to extraterrestrial biological entities for EBEs

1118
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,800
I'm identifying flying objects in fact real is real is the airplanes flying over your head

1119
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:20,800
And that there has been a monumental cover up for more than half a century

1120
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,800
It's very significant that someone of the staffer of a governor would come out and say that they

1121
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,800
It's not what they experienced a UFO

1122
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,800
Because it brings a lot of credibility and strength to the case

1123
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:39,800
NASA knew very little about the object reported by the Apollo 11 crew

1124
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:43,800
It was obviously an unidentified flying object

1125
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,800
The time has come for the government to tell the people what it knows

1126
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:52,800
The truth has got to come out for over 30 years to late

1127
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,800
The people not only have a right to know they have a need to know

1128
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:01,800
Well it's not impossible if this spacecraft came to Earth from an alien civilization

1129
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:05,800
Boy talk about making history on the radio

1130
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:09,800
The disclosure project that's what I couldn't think of

1131
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,800
That's the name of it Google that or take a look at it on YouTube

1132
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,800
The disclosure project it will open up your eyes

1133
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,800
So now of course I'm feeling I'm feeling pretty good

1134
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,800
I'm feeling like there's a lot of stuff happening

1135
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,800
And I hope I've been able to take you through this show

1136
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:28,800
Hopefully not too much of a downer and not too much of a freak out

1137
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,800
Because you know you can of course go nuts if you really start to think about this stuff

1138
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,800
But bit by bit let's just keep our eyes open

1139
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:43,800
Let's watch each other's back and let's be in a lookout for things that are really big moving pieces

1140
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:48,800
Like with this new Polywell energy device that has been developed

1141
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,800
Hold on a second this was a fantastic story that I saw

1142
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,800
I'm like and it looks so alien in nature

1143
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,800
It is

1144
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,800
Bussard iEC fusion reactor

1145
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:04,800
Which could produce a hundred megawatts and you see pictures of this thing

1146
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,800
It almost looks like what's the Jody Foster movie

1147
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,800
My brain is not with me today or at least not the memory part

1148
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,800
Anywell and anywell anyway

1149
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:20,800
This polywell thing is something that some guy developed

1150
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,800
And then I guess Dr. Nibola is his name

1151
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,800
He's picked this up and they're starting to see results

1152
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,800
And there's all kinds of exciting things going on

1153
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,800
So let's be careful of what's happening

1154
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,800
Let's as I said watch watch our backs

1155
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,800
Let's definitely live our lives with passion

1156
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,800
And while at last

1157
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,800
Enjoy our freedom

1158
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,800
Another fine medial presentation

1159
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,800
Stick it in your ear

1160
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,800
Thank you
