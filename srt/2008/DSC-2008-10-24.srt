166
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,120
Power to the vine

167
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,120
Power to the boys and play rock and roll

168
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,120
I make mine a lot so sweet

169
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,120
I do the girls a new before

170
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,120
So I'm yet to be

171
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:52,120
Power to all our friends

172
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:57,120
We don't need to take the blame of the beat

173
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:03,120
The people we want to be

174
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:07,120
Baby, power to you and me

175
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,120
There's one strong man

176
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,120
Plowing in the valley

177
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,120
He's living off the land

178
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,120
Power to the land

179
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,120
There's some young girl

180
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,120
Land down in the morning call

181
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:26,120
Laying in the sun

182
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,120
Power to the sun

183
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,120
Power to the boys and play rock and roll

184
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,120
I make mine a lot so sweet

185
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,120
I do the girls a new before

186
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,120
So I'm yet to be

187
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:47,120
Power to all our friends

188
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:52,120
We don't need to take the blame of the beat

189
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,120
The people we want to be

190
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:03,120
Baby, power to you and me

191
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,120
Power to the boys and play rock and roll

192
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,120
I make mine a lot so sweet

193
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,120
I do the girls a new before

194
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,120
So I'm yet to be

195
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:21,120
Power to all our friends

196
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:26,120
We don't need to take the blame of the beat

197
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:31,120
We don't need to take the blame of the beat

198
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:36,120
Baby, power to you and me

199
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:40,120
We don't need to take the blame of the beat

200
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,120
I gotta kick her

201
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,120
Baby, power to all our friends

202
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,120
Surf Cliff Richard

203
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,120
You know this song is from

204
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:57,440
is from, oh man, I don't know, this has got to be from early 70s and I can still sing the words

205
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:04,320
almost, almost the whole song through. It's kind of hokey but it's just one of those sound

206
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:11,840
tracks in my lives and you know what, it is a song about power and we are going to need to band

207
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:17,600
together and bond together to get through those and to prepare to change things every single step

208
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:22,640
of the way. Again, the first, the first way to do that is just by awakening the rest of the

209
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:28,320
world up to what's really going on. From the BBC, this article, and this is from earlier in the week

210
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:35,600
21st of October. Of course, we all laugh about the nut cases who say, hey, there's a movement towards

211
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:41,600
a new world order and it's going to start in finances. In fact, title of the article,

212
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:50,240
Sarcosi, that is the president of the European Union currently, the president of France.

213
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:59,040
He wants a European Union economy team. Here comes French president Nicholas Sarcosi has called

214
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:06,480
for a European economic government to ensure a more united EU response to financial turmoil. Now,

215
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:10,880
just follow me for a second here with what happened with the European Union.

216
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:16,720
It started off as kind of like a trade agreement and economic union. And then, well,

217
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,320
you know, we might as well have some money together. That's where it's started to go wrong

218
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:26,080
because you control the money, you control the entire, you control people and they are controlling

219
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:32,480
and now they want to have an economic government to really control everything you do.

220
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:42,480
Oh, man, it's happening. It's so happening. The 15 countries that use the Euro agreed on a massive

221
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:49,360
bailout package earlier this month. I mean, make no mistake. This is not because of people not

222
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:55,200
paying mortgage in the United States. This is all part of the system. It has seen interbank lending

223
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,960
dry up threatening the wider economy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, bloody, bloody, bloody, bloody blow.

224
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,360
European governments must follow up with bold steps on the recent commitments. This is, uh,

225
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:12,800
the usual troublemakers who are recommending this the international monetary fund, the world bank.

226
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:18,000
Those guys seem to be laughing quite a lot, though. Don't they? So it didn't start in America.

227
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,880
Yeah, we got our problems and there's definitely a lot wrong here, but this is happening globally.

228
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:29,280
And I can tell you that many countries in Europe are a lot further down the road. You just don't really

229
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:34,160
know it yet because I don't know. Maybe because it's your, you got too much American television.

230
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,000
You think you're actually free, but you're a lot further down the road. The Netherlands has an

231
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,680
example. They're already talking about work credits. So companies will be forced to take you to work

232
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,760
for them and you'll be forced to work for them with you. Wanted or not because the government says,

233
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:55,440
so, come on, this is not right. One thing I want to reiterate, this is not something that's

234
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:02,080
started with mortgages only in America. This is something that has been coordinated globally,

235
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:09,280
certainly the United States, certainly the European Union. Whatever you say, it didn't start here,

236
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:16,240
it was coordinated. The global, they're doing it to us that trying to bring us down, stay awake

237
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,240
and we'll be safe.

238
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:52,000
We've got a new queen, we'll see it all in a variety, set fire, let's go buy it in the store,

239
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,280
let's buy it in the store. We've got this, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world,

240
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,160
this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world,

241
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,000
this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world,

242
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,160
this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world,

243
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,000
this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world,

244
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:21,040
this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is always the world

245
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:34,000
this is the world, this is the world, this world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world, this is the world,

246
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
All the fun is just a lot of time

247
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
We need to solve the fire

248
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
We didn't mind it, but we tried to find

249
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Little rock, half the night

250
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
We make you mad, I can't watch

251
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
What we need to show a light

252
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
We don't know where we're going

253
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Love and love, I'm trying to go

254
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Can't fall, you may stop

255
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
But no harm, I tried to knock the little mic

256
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh

257
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
And then the space will keep my fear

258
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
We can't stop, it's a little no-go

259
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Do you know if it's in the ring?

260
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Hey, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

261
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
So far, so far, so far, so far

262
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
We didn't stop, but far

263
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
But we did find it, but we tried to find it

264
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I mean, why I chose Stranger industry land

265
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
A little in Berlin, may it be the nation

266
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Law and 얘는 are burningits, be your way

267
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Ole Miss Jorn, Glendis, Can Be You Fails

268
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
All knowledge, great about attention

269
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
So just keep him safe, blow away

270
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
What I do, I have to say

271
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Take me strong, I'm alive

272
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
There's always women, so far, so far

273
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
We're here, free, thus far

274
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
We did so the fire

275
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
We did so the fire

276
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
We did so the fire

277
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
We did so the fire

278
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,000
We did so the fire

279
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
We did so the fire

280
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
We did so the fire

281
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
We did so the fire

282
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
We did so the fire

283
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,000
It's pretty much a little history lesson for you there

284
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
You hear all that crap that went down

285
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
That song really Joel says we didn't start the fire

286
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
At first we didn't they started it

287
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
They've been burning with it for a long, long time

288
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I'm so happy to tell you that

289
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I'm going to share the secret of life with you my secret

290
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I'm going to be able to articulate it

291
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
How you can change your life

292
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
And subsequently since we're all connected

293
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Change the world

294
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
It's almost like an experiment we're going to do together

295
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I guarantee you're going to have results

296
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
You're going to be reporting back to me

297
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
You're going to be sending invoicemails

298
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
You're going to be making an entire audio montage

299
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
How happy you are that you've discovered this secret

300
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
And it is just a bright shining light

301
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
That will help all of us get through what's happening now

302
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
What's coming

303
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
No matter what happens

304
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
You can change it

305
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And it's a...

306
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I'll manage some holistic shit

307
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
You're going to love it for sure

308
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I've had a lot of teachers in getting to where I am today

309
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Understanding how the world fits together

310
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
After obviously having been a part of the system

311
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Having been a part of the big lie that television is

312
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Yeah, very minor stuff and entertainment lies

313
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
And editing lies and editorial lies

314
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
But it is a part of a mind control machine

315
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
And that same box can be used for good

316
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
It is given me tremendous education

317
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
And even things that I heard a year ago

318
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Or two years ago or ten years ago

319
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Or people that I've been following

320
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
It all has become so clear

321
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And I know it's all becoming clear to you as well

322
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
As you've been listening and following along

323
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
With what's happening on this very show

324
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
No matter how infrequent it appears to be

325
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,000
One of those people who just has been a tremendous teacher

326
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
To me and to millions of others

327
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Unfortunately passed away earlier this year

328
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I want to play a piece that some friendly chuckle had popped up on the source code

329
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Drop.au slash daily source code

330
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Because it once again just reminds you

331
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Reminds you who's really in charge

332
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
So take it from a man who was around long enough

333
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
And saw it early on in his life and his career

334
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
George Carter

335
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
But there's a reason

336
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
There's a reason for this

337
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
There's a reason education sucks

338
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
It's the same reason that it will never ever ever be fixed

339
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Never going to get any better

340
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Don't look for it

341
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Be happy with what you got

342
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Because the owners of this country don't want that

343
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I'm talking about the real owners now

344
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
The big wealthy

345
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
The real owners

346
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
The big wealthy business interests

347
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
That control things and make all the important decisions

348
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
They get the politicians

349
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
They're irrelevant

350
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
The politicians are put there to give you the idea

351
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
That you have freedom of choice

352
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
You don't

353
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
You have no choice

354
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
You have owners

355
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
They own you

356
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
They own everything

357
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
They own all the important land

358
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
They own and control the corporations

359
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
They've long since bought and paid for the senate

360
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
The congress, the state houses, the city halls

361
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
They got the judges in their back pockets

362
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And they own all the big media

363
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
All the big media companies

364
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
So they control

365
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Just about all the news and information you get to hear

366
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
They got you by the balls

367
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
They spend billions of dollars every year

368
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Loving, lobbying

369
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
So get what they want

370
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Well, we know what they want

371
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
They want more for themselves

372
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Unless for everybody else

373
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
But I'll tell you what they don't want

374
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
They don't want a population of citizens

375
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Capable of critical thinking

376
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
They don't want well-informed, well-educated people

377
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Capable of critical thinking

378
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
That doesn't help them

379
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
That's against their interest

380
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
That's right

381
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
You know something

382
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
They don't want people who are smart enough

383
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
To sit around the kitchen table and figure out

384
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
How badly they're getting fucked by the system

385
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
They threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago

386
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
They don't want that

387
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
You know what they want?

388
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
They want obedient workers

389
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Obedient workers

390
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
People who are just smart enough to run their machines

391
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
And do the paperwork

392
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
And just dumb enough

393
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
To passively accept all these increasingly

394
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Shittier jobs with the lower pay

395
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
The longer hours the reduced benefits

396
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
The end of overtime

397
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And the vanishing passion that disappears

398
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
The minute you go to collect it

399
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And now they're coming for your social security money

400
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
They watch your fucking retirement money

401
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
They want it back

402
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street

403
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
And you know something? They'll get it

404
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
They'll get it all from you

405
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Sooner or later

406
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Because they own this fucking place

407
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
It's a big club

408
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And you ain't in it

409
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
You and I are not in the big club

410
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
By the way, it's the same big club

411
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
They used to beat you over the head with all day long

412
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
And they tell you what to believe

413
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
All day long beat you over the head in their media

414
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
It's only what to believe

415
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
What to think

416
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
What to buy

417
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
The table is tilted folks

418
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
The game is rigged

419
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And nobody seems to notice

420
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Nobody seems to care

421
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Good on us hardworking people

422
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
White collar blue collar doesn't matter

423
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
What color shirts you have on

424
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Good on us hardworking people

425
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Continue

426
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
These are people of modest means

427
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Continue to elect these rich cock suckers

428
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Who don't give a fuck about them

429
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
They don't give a fuck about you

430
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
They don't give a fuck about you

431
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
They don't care about you

rotational

477

As everything

478
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Squinds

479
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
In theELL

480
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
In the K Expl catalyst

481
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
The government told us that

482
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Because the land you love is freedom

483
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
It's just that the land is regulated

484
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And if we hold him together

485
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
We can bring him back to USA

486
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:44,000
In this land

487
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:51,000
We like to be in this land

488
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:58,000
We're talking to USA

489
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Bring back the U.S.

490
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Say it!

491
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Tenacious D, the government totally sucks

492
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
You know, on the daily source code

493
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Yeah, they totally suck

494
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
We let them suck

495
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
We forgot to remind them continuously

496
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
That they work for us

497
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
So this thing is hitting home

498
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,000
And I've decided that I've got to share

499
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Friends of mine

500
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
What do we talk about?

501
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Who, man?

502
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Was it four weeks ago when I got here

503
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
And Christina, who takes care of the condo

504
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Forming and basically cleans up after my ass

505
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
She had lost her house

506
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Because her mortgage skyrocketed

507
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Her husband or lost his job

508
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Yeah, you might have heard

509
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
One of our investors

510
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Sequoia Capital had an all-hands meeting

511
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
A couple weeks ago

512
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Where they had they started off with this

513
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
You know, this big power point

514
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
And it was like RIP

515
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Rest in peace the good times

516
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And everyone has to cut

517
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
60-70% of course

518
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
This is really for companies

519
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
They're not making any money

520
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
So a lot of companies are going to go out of business

521
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I heard that the electric car company

522
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Tesla is essentially shut down

523
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Everyone who put in their money

524
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Maybe even lost their money

525
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Because they were using it to develop with

526
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
We've got

527
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Boeing laying off people

528
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
We've got forward laying off people

529
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
We've got banks laying off people

530
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
It's hitting every single industry

531
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
This is exactly what you heard

532
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Peter Schiff and Glenn Beck talk about

533
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
You're going to get inflation

534
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
You're going to get huge unemployment rates

535
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
And it's hitting our own

536
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Chocolate heads

537
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
It's hitting our own

538
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Matt, who was often contributed to the source code

539
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Sent out an email to a lot of his colleagues

540
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
And people who's been working with

541
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
He's a great guy

542
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I've known him for quite a long time

543
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Done business with him

544
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I just want to share his email with you

545
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Since it was clearly not directed

546
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Only to me

547
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
But at an email list

548
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Clearly to his associates

549
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
And just to share this

550
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And you know

551
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
To feel his pain

552
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Because we're all going to feel it

553
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
One way or the other

554
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
High he says

555
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Sadly, the financial health of Porter Noveli

556
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
is taken another turn for the worse

557
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Porter Noveli is a PR company

558
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
They had another massive round of layoffs

559
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
This week

560
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Unfortunately, I was among them this time

561
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
This was especially surprising

562
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Since I was busy all the time

563
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
And in fact, I had to hire on

564
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Four freelancers just to keep up with the work

565
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
In my department

566
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
If you hear any positions, please feel free to contact me

567
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
At this address

568
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I can get you my resume

569
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
After 10 years of collecting dust

570
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
All the best

571
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
From that

572
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And this is what really really bugs me

573
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Okay

574
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
So we have this

575
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Trillion dollars

576
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Which is probably more like

577
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Three or four trillion dollars

578
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
After the central banks

579
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Get a hold of the so-called cash

580
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
They're receiving

581
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
It's going into fixing this BS

582
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Financial system

583
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
It's bailing out people

584
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
They're taking the money

585
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
They're buying places down

586
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
They're getting ready to flee

587
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Well, the crap comes down

588
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
And we have to sit around with all the

589
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
All the debris and the pieces that are left over

590
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And people like myself

591
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
You know, mevio

592
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
It fits in the small medium business category

593
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
And the small category

594
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
You know, we don't have more than 75 people

595
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Worldwide

596
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
In fact, it's less than that

597
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
You know, we work our ass off

598
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Travel, not seeing families

599
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Working on weekends

600
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Not just myself, not just my partners

601
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
And co-founders and upper management

602
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
The whole company's working

603
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Really, really hard

604
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
They're pitching in

605
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
They believe in trying to build something

606
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
We get nothing

607
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
No, in fact, we get screwed

608
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
We're only getting taxed more

609
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
We're going to get totally bone

610
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Where is the whole backbone

611
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
The whole concept of America

612
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Is that you work hard

613
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
An honest wage

614
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
You have a vision

615
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
You believe in something

616
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
The law of attraction

617
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
We're going to talk about the

618
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Secret of life

619
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
And you move forward

620
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
And all the other people

621
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
On the high end

622
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
They're getting bailed out

623
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
On the low end

624
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
They're getting handouts

625
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
What is this supposed to...

626
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
What is this going to come to?

627
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
This is not the way it's supposed to work

628
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Where in the world can we have

629
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Something that is like

630
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
The true American dream of work hard

631
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Play hard

632
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
And enjoy the fruits of your labor

633
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

634
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Chocolate heads

635
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

636
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

637
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

638
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

639
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

640
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

641
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

642
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

643
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

644
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

645
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

646
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

647
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

648
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

649
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

650
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

651
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

652
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

653
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

654
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

655
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

656
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

657
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I don't know, but it ain't here

658
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Filming

659
01:13:49,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

660
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:49,000
oh oh oh oh

661
01:14:49,000 --> 01:15:19,000
oh oh oh oh

662
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:34,920
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no it's not that's all right

663
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,800
If anyone can bring a bag, it's us.

664
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:45,040
David Bowie, Pat, Petty, this is not America, I think that was the Falcon of the Snowman,

665
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,440
was the only thing.

666
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:56,320
You know, I just realized it being well past midnight, I haven't had any dinner.

667
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:02,840
I got back from our final meeting of the week, I did have breakfast, I did have lunch,

668
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:08,040
but I was so excited to finally get downcrackin', just spend a couple hours prepping

669
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:13,280
the show, gettin' ready, and, well, there you go, I don't think it's a good to eat this

670
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,280
late.

671
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:17,840
But I'm not done yet, ah, ah, ah, this is going to be probably one of the longest

672
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,360
shows I've ever produced, but it's 800, so you know, maybe it's one of those you keep

673
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:27,160
around, and if not for just the history of what we talked about on this show, then maybe

674
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:31,280
for the music, for the soundtrack to our life, which I've put a lot of research into this

675
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,280
one.

676
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:36,040
Really broke out the old archives.

677
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:42,680
Let's see another chucklehead who left a comment on the source code, drop.io slash daily

678
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:43,680
source code.

679
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,000
Adam, Eric from Portland.

680
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Wow, of course, Eric from Portland, a frequent caller.

681
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,720
I heard Joe Biden the other day say that there's going to be a crisis, a generated crisis.

682
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:59,680
Wow, you know, the tape was all greeny and it wasn't clear, it sounded like this was

683
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,320
not supposed to be on tape.

684
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:06,880
I'm wondering if you think this is a projection of a false bike terror attack, is this

685
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,080
international politics putting in there?

686
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,080
I'd love to hear you take on that.

687
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,080
Yeah, I told.

688
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:16,200
That's it, yeah.

689
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,160
Which reminds me, please visit our sponsors.

690
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:25,560
Go to the show notes of daily source code.com or in this source code entry at curry.com.

691
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:31,160
And I use them, please use my codes for domain names, for cool stuff at Brooksstone.com,

692
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:32,920
what else do we have?

693
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:38,320
Budget, run a car, e-music, if any of those things, if you're going to buy any of that

694
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,320
anyway for whatever reason, just use one of my codes.

695
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,640
You can't get a better price.

696
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:43,640
That's why they're there.

697
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:47,720
That's what we do in negotiate those prices so that you have the best deal available.

698
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:52,320
Why waste time going somewhere else for those categories of stuff?

699
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,680
So yeah, about that Joe Biden comment.

700
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,920
That was actually, he was at a fundraiser in Seattle.

701
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:00,960
I believe this was Sunday a week ago.

702
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:06,120
And yeah, and of course the audio was all over the source code drop, but it's, it's not

703
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:11,560
going to be legible by the time it goes through multi-MP3 compressions, et cetera, into

704
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,560
your earbuds.

705
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,320
Well, I'm your speakers where you may listen to this particular format of show, the longer

706
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,280
format source code.

707
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:23,440
So here's what he said, because it, and of course, this is, you can find the link in

708
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,920
the show notes.

709
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:29,400
Mark my words, Biden told donors at a Seattle fundraiser, Sunday night.

710
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:35,840
You will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy.

711
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,840
Wow.

712
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:37,840
That's big there, right?

713
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:44,120
So I'm just going to say that means a political incident, a global political incident.

714
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,480
The world is looking.

715
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:51,080
He says we're about to elect a brilliant 47 year old senator president of the United States.

716
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,080
Watch.

717
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:57,320
We're going to have an international crisis, a generated crisis to test the metal of this

718
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,320
guy.

719
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,320
You hear that?

720
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:00,640
A generated crisis.

721
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,040
This is what the financial crisis is all about.

722
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,040
It is coming.

723
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,040
It's known.

724
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:10,440
It may even have something to do with that secret meeting they had in the House of Representatives

725
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:14,960
where they'd locked everything down, kicked everybody out, and it was something was told to

726
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,760
them that were not supposed to know, well, I'm pretty sure it was about this.

727
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,160
Because they know about it.

728
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,560
Don't be fooled.

729
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:28,160
Biden goes on to say, he's going to need help to something something to stand with

730
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,600
them because it's not going to be apparent initially.

731
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,240
It's not going to be apparent that we're right.

732
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:37,120
Not quite sure what he means by that.

733
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:42,520
But I'm sure it does relate to the fact that it's known, that it's coming, and I'm

734
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,200
pretty convinced it has to do with the American dollar.

735
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,120
So some say we'll be somewhere in January, could be late.

736
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:54,800
And I think it'll probably start somewhere in January and around spring, summer next

737
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,840
year, is when it's really going to hit, they're going to say screw it.

738
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,080
We don't want your dollar anymore.

739
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:03,280
That's the only thing I can imagine that this is about.

740
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:06,360
And it doesn't matter who becomes president of the United States.

741
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:09,560
They both work for the same people.

742
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:10,560
Okay.

743
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,960
They were working for big corporations for Wall Street and directly for the banks.

744
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:20,640
Just follow the pyramid all the way up and you come to the same true owners of the earth.

745
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:27,640
It was funny, by the way, in that, how that hearing, congressional hearing, where they

746
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:37,240
are talking to Greenspan and to, was it, cocks and to snow?

747
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:43,960
At a certain point, the Republican, which is named Davis, I believe.

748
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:50,640
He said, he asked the question to this panel of three, these three thieves, and liars, said,

749
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:56,080
in the past 20 years, gentlemen, do you have any idea which presidential candidate

750
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:00,320
received the most donations from subprime mortgage lenders?

751
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:04,280
In other words, Wall Street does nothing to do with what the company did as long as it's

752
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:09,440
a Wall Street company who deals in crap money and making up money and lying and cheating

753
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,040
and stealing from us.

754
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:16,040
In 20 years, gentlemen, which presidential candidate received the most donations, basically

755
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,040
from Wall Street?

756
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:24,320
The answer, Barack Obama, but it's only a little bit more than John McCain received,

757
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:29,240
so neither of these jibronies deserve to be running anything but the taps in the Lincoln

758
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,240
Bedroom.

759
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:35,000
It's a farce, and unfortunately, I'm not going to be here to share with you what's going

760
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,320
to happen after the election.

761
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:41,480
After November 4th, I'll be in Europe, I'll be reporting in from there, and I'm sure

762
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:46,560
tomorrow, I know a gentleman, John C. Duboric, and I get together will be talking about it.

763
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,760
About the hypocrisy of this American electoral system, and about how the entire world

764
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:56,640
has been snow jobbed into believing that you can only choose one of these two candidates.

765
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:04,080
Yes, one of the two tribes who will go to war over control, over us, control by the same

766
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,480
slave masters.

767
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:21,840
One is all too bad, so one, one is all too bad, so one, one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so

768
01:22:51,760 --> 01:23:21,760
so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one you all so bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so one is all too bad, so two was all too bad,

769
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,760
It's time for you to be alone

770
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:29,760
We're all alone

771
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,760
We're all alone

772
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:38,760
We're all alone

773
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,760
We're all alone

774
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,760
We're all alone

775
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,760
We're all alone

776
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,760
We're all alone

777
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:55,760
I'm sure you're alive

778
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:05,760
I'm alive

779
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,760
All alone

780
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,760
I swear we're all alone

781
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:11,760
Love and love

782
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:12,760
Love and love

783
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:25,760
This is the worst thing you can follow me

784
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:33,760
This is the worst thing you can follow me

785
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:40,760
Thank you, John, John, what is all that you can do?

786
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:47,760
John, John, John, what is all that you can do?

787
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:57,760
We got such a chance, and you're the one we got the way

788
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:10,760
We got such a chance, and you're the one we got the way

789
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,760
All of them ain't here

790
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:22,760
We got a chance, and you're the one we got the way

791
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:28,760
We got a chance, and you're the one we got the way

We got a chance, and you're the one we got the way

We got a chance, and you're the one we got the way

822
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,760
We got a chance, and you're the one we got the way

823
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,760
We got a chance, and you're the one we got the way

824
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:51,440
machine works. I'm going to read you one paragraph from this TV and the social construction

825
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:59,440
of reality. Okay. Let me say that again. TV and the social construction of reality. So check

826
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:04,040
this out. The technical events test, which is a test you have to do. I'm not going to go

827
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:09,240
into it right here, but the technical events test dramatically reveals the functions of

828
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:15,440
the political institution of television in A, training us to shorten our attention span,

829
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:23,040
be making ordinary life appear dull and see injecting a hypnotic quality into our ordinary

830
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:31,320
awareness and decourshing us into its reality. This happens continuously and it happens

831
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:38,040
in drama. It happens in news. It happens with particularly with so-called reality shows with

832
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:43,960
which have nothing at all to do with reality. And it's really part of a very old concept.

833
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:50,960
This is not new at all. It's just a 20th or now a 21st century version of something

834
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,960
that's been around for centuries.

835
01:27:52,960 --> 01:28:01,000
Yeah, I'm scoring. Hey, you're a crazy bastard, but let me show. I love no agenda too. I've been

836
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,640
reading about the Roman Empire and read an article or a section today of a book that

837
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:11,480
I was in a pretty industry and in light of what you've been talking about lately. It says

838
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:16,640
but the gladiatorial games served a purpose beyond mere entertainment to the Romans, the

839
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:21,280
games and other forms of public entertainment, the field both a political and a social

840
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:27,480
need. Certainly they served it avert the idle masses from political unrest. It was said

841
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:33,400
of Emperor Trojan that he understood that although the distribution of grains and money

842
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:39,920
satisfied the individual, spectacles were necessary for the contentment of the masses. So in

843
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:44,720
other words, he knew he had to give him things, give him grain, and I give him money to

844
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:51,480
keep him satisfied, but they also need to be content with some diversion henceforth.

845
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:54,920
Now we have the American Gladiators.

846
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,920
Hey man, thanks for the show.

847
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,360
That's right. That's just one version of a spectacle. We've had a spectacle that's been

848
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:03,640
on television for 10 years by now.

849
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,640
Over here of the Cherry Springer show.

850
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:39,640
Now here comes our next dance and it's a squad best because it's a true and trash brother.

851
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:43,000
If many acres back in Crackets like when animals attack they all exhibit reprehensible

852
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
behavior and if in the no sir of their clothes they're on their toes and how it goes

853
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,400
they get so violent they have to sign a waiver. There was worry because they can't find a

854
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:53,440
twin blame on the air they don't care they got no shame. There was a good one true for

855
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,680
the little strange way and he found out that his wife had a sex change. They have a

856
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,680
dinner seat on screen when he else tells a link. They have a history of reviving

857
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:04,400
after Jersey's baby. So they had to find. We're the same twins and they're the best

858
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:08,640
night. Five days since that awful ball. They still haven't got the blood off the wall

859
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:12,400
and it's bad. Three days since the bitter. But when they gank you in a game you

860
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:16,560
always like to get a. Finally done on me. We're done with time on that cherry

861
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,800
Springer. Baby, I'm a sleeper with your sister.

862
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:24,840
Oh, which one? Oh, what happened sleeper? We got that friend Jay.

863
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:28,840
Oh, damn. Oh, me too. I'm a sleeper with your dog, woofie.

864
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:32,840
What the fuck? What the fuck? I'm a sleeper with your pet go.

865
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:36,360
That ghost doesn't love you. Just don't watch it. There's just no stopping. Your brain

866
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:40,200
shuts down. That your eye goes dropping. Jerry's the king of confrontation. He's

867
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:44,280
a sensation. He puts a sense of indication. It's totally worthless like a bad check. It's

868
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:47,280
like a train wreck. Don't want to stare but you gotta look away. I felt he just

869
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:51,200
he beat us up shows. But with my weirdos, the ratings are being higher every day. If you

870
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:54,000
see the show, well then you know it just as low as you can go the gas or tacky and they're

871
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,960
raging and freezing. So I'm ugly with them and the room and that is cool. I'm in the face of

872
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:01,000
some motherfucked drag queen. What is the game that show where people scream of

873
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,800
Venetese? Can't get here from a chair to their hobbies. Jerry, during all the crowds

874
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,560
heard their favorite chant shit. I heard of my TV. I just can't. I have a tendency to

875
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:12,000
watch a ring that you see. I have a history of taping each one. It's bad.

876
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Whoa, he says the show about. I know girls with problems. They should work out.

877
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Five days, that's the big surprise. So I'm worried for the cheese to leave. What do you

878
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
say?

879
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Yeah.

880
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Yeah.

881
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Yeah.

882
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
It's alright, man. As long as you realize what's going on.

883
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Yeah.

884
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:43,000
We live in the society of the spectacle. Something that was discovered centuries ago.

885
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Good book written about that.

886
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Like in 18900 something or other.

887
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Man, that's another link I got to go find for you. Hey, just a reminder, the secret of life

888
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:00,000
is coming up, which is going to save you. It's going to, it's been saving me for years.

889
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
And I'm going to share that secret with you. I mean, it's not a big secret. It actually

890
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,000
is called the secret we're going to talk about. It's been documented a book, which

891
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:14,000
really puts it into context. But it's all part of themes and theories and

892
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:22,000
different, different learnings that that I've come across throughout my path and life.

893
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,000
And we are hand on such a high note. You're going to be just zinging through the weekend

894
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,000
and for many, many weekends to come. Just taking with television for a moment here because

895
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
there was something really funny that showed up on the drop. This is a cure of

896
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Phillips from CNN. And sometimes the truth really does shine through on television.

897
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
It's, it's fascinating when it happens.

898
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,000
It, you could call it a Freudian slip. And if you want to call it that, well, this one's

899
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
to do this. And the battle for the White House, from two of our favorite analysts,

900
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Roland Martin, well, I don't know. I'm a go favorite there. CNN political analyst and

901
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:57,000
you know you love me, you know. At least, Leslie Sanchez, Republican

902
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:02,000
strategist and CNN political, kind of contributor is always on time.

903
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Let's hear that one again. And as Republican strategist and CNN political

904
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:11,000
kind of contributor is always on time.

905
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Oh, that's funny. That's funny. She meant it too. You know she meant it.

906
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I want to get back for a second to our international chuckle heads.

907
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Just need to talk about Europe for a second here as I stated earlier that

908
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,000
what's going on in the world is really going on in the world. And it's not just the

909
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,000
United States. Let's shift over to Europe for a second.

910
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:40,000
This is following on on what I said about the European Union.

911
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
This is actually from the European Parliament. It's just a great piece of

912
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
video. Now, in the United Kingdom, a lot of people do not like this guy,

913
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Farage, I think his name is, who was of the UKIP, the United Kingdom

914
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Independent Party. And I think just listening to what he has to say, he

915
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
may just be getting a bad rap. I have no idea what his history is

916
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:04,000
with, you know, with his political career in the United Kingdom.

917
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
But hearing him stand up in European Parliament, saying the following

918
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
really gave me once again great respect for this guy, at least for his

919
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
thinking and his current words because it's spot on the month.

920
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
From 8th of October.

921
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
President, what a funny old European Union it is, isn't it?

922
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Last Saturday afternoon, after a Johnny Good Lunch at the

923
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Alize, the European leaders stood on the steps and they talked with

924
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:33,000
very weak smiles about solidarity. The smiles were weak, of course,

925
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,000
because President Sarkozy's U.S. star bailout plan had already

926
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
clapped in the bed of dust. But nonetheless, United

927
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Wastand is what was said, and yet with almost comic hypocrisy,

928
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:49,000
the German Chancellor decided that German interests come first,

929
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
and European interests come second, and she acted.

930
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Perhaps for the first time in years, she got louder applause from her

931
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
own electorate, because it was the Irish that started this trend,

932
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,000
the week before, by going their own way, and my admiration for Ireland,

933
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I have to say, grows by the day.

934
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
But I think for the last week, it's going to prove to be the

935
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
watershed moment for this entire European project.

936
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:16,000
You see, the only way to stop countries acting in their own

937
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
national interest is to take that power away from them, to form

938
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
a treasury department, there in Frankfurt, that has power,

939
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,000
over tax, and power, over government spending.

940
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
And indeed, I've heard some of the EU extremists,

941
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
this afternoon, effectively call for that.

942
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Yet, you can't do it, because it won't come on public support.

943
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,000
In fact, to do that, there'll be even more unpopular than your

944
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,000
hated Lisbon Tracy. No more likely is that what's happened

945
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
in the last week marks the beginning of the end.

946
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
The markets are saying it already.

947
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Italian government bonds now yield 1% more than German or

948
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Frenchist youth, government bonds.

949
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
The markets are saying that economic and monetary union

950
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,000
will not last, and I'm not surprised, because it never

951
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
was an optimal currency zone.

952
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
One interest rate could never fit all these different countries,

953
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
and you've never had proper public support.

954
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
But it must be one thing or the other.

955
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
It's either a full EU state that controls everything,

956
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,000
or it is disintegration and back to national control.

957
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
The credit crunch is hitting and hurting all of us,

958
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
but I see a speck of light at the end of a tunnel.

959
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I see a dividend, possibly the beginning of the end,

960
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
of this whole mad and unwanted project.

961
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Fantastic.

962
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
You know, I have no idea why he gets such a bad rap in the UK,

963
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
perhaps it's because maybe they've set it up that way.

964
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
You know, whoever controls the media can put anyone in any kind of

965
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
light they want to, but this guy is spot on.

966
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Either Europe, the people of Europe of all the individual

967
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
countries who already work together, who already like each other.

968
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
We have the love parade together in Berlin.

969
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
We do all kinds of stuff as normal people.

970
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Forget about what our unelected representatives are doing

971
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,000
in the European managing Europe and the European

972
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
unions top there in Brussels.

973
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Forget about all that, okay?

974
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,000
What he's saying is correct.

975
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
They want to control everything.

976
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
They want full control over you.

977
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,000
I believe that Europeans, possibly, are more awake than the Americans

978
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
and you can start doing something about this.

979
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Start fighting again, something that Bob Marley identified

980
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
decades ago as the Babylon system.

981
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
It is a vampire mass.

982
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,000
We refuse to beat.

983
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:43,000
What you wanted us to beat.

984
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
We are what we are.

985
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,000
That's the way it's going to be.

986
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
If you don't know.

987
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,000
You came and you came down.

988
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Or you'll eat the words.

989
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I'll put your energy in the mouth.

990
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Talk in love, I'll bring those.

991
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Leave them free, Bob.

992
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
And the energy.

993
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
It's just for every image.

994
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I didn't know why it came.

995
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
It's much too low.

996
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
It's the rhythm.

997
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
It's the rhythm.

998
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,000
As we've been tried, it's the one way.

999
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Ride with words too long, treat it.

1000
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Leave it.

1001
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:42,000
It's Bob Marley's 언제 It's the vampire.

1002
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Yeah.

1003
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Again.

1004
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Have come to hear it.

1005
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
with the Mayors.

1006
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:53,000
What we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if

1007
01:39:53,000 --> 01:40:23,000
we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't tell you what we have to teach them if we can't

1010
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Uh, please see last two bar Friday for an explanation of that one.

1011
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
You know what, I gotta get into my bar Marley mode here.

1012
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Yeah.

1013
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Oh, yes, much better.

1014
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I feel good now.

1015
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,000
A wonderful fade out once again.

1016
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Okay, something here for a new check-out.

1017
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,000
The chuckleheads formerly known as the arrowheads who I used to listen to my,

1018
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,000
my program in the Netherlands, however short it lasted.

1019
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Of course, that was, that's what you get when you try to tell the truth and

1020
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
open people's eyes and mainstream media.

1021
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Eventually, the financial system comes in and stops it all.

1022
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Um, the president of the Dutch, uh, central bank,

1023
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
not velling.

1024
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
And, uh, there's a link in the show notes for you guys.

1025
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
It's in English, so other people can participate, but just to show how it all fits

1026
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,000
together, you've probably heard of the trilateral commission,

1027
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
which was set up by one of the true owners of the globe.

1028
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
The Rockefeller's David Rockefeller, along with the Chase Manhattan Bank, which, of course,

1029
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
is now JP Morgan Chase.

1030
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Um, he was a member.

1031
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Oh, it has been a member of the trilateral commission since 2005.

1032
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:44,000
These are the guys who actually have put out the blue prints for this, for this new world order,

1033
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:48,000
for this first, the financial collapse, taking control over the finances,

1034
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,000
then taking over governmental control.

1035
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Look, I don't mind if we're all called the same country, but I kind of like the idea that,

1036
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:59,000
you know, they're different cultures and, and some different things when you cross the border.

1037
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:04,000
And that's what makes us beautiful as a, as a, as a people as a population of the globe.

1038
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Is it, we're not all the same, that we are a little bit different.

1039
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:12,000
But to have guys like this guy, just looking at his picture makes my stomach turn.

1040
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
These are the people who are all in this, it's like the builder group.

1041
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Only the builder, which, by the way, was set up by the Prince of Orange, Prince,

1042
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Baron Art of the Netherlands.

1043
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, there's, there's a lot, there's a, there's a reason why I'm doing this stuff.

1044
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
There's a reason because I lived in these countries.

1045
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I'm living in the UK, I've been in America.

1046
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:37,000
For whatever reason, this is currently my destiny, I guess, to bring this information to you.

1047
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:44,000
And, uh, boy, it's, uh, you know what it is, it's the way of the world.

1048
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,000
The way of the world that we're going to change.

1049
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:52,000
And I'm going to teach you how you can use your inherent power and the law of attraction,

1050
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,000
what you own to change the way of the world to change it and make it better.

1051
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1052
01:44:44,000 --> 01:45:14,000
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1053
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:21,000
If you're hard to solve, I don't have a treat

1054
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Cause the worst is gone

1055
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Stay young at home

1056
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:32,000
I call you never and we're all in the world

1057
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
And we're all in the world

1058
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Yes, we're all in the world

And we're all in the world

We're all in the world

We're all in the world

1087
01:49:25,220 --> 01:49:28,020
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah. Dedado La La La La La a sixties, yeah yeah.

1088
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:34,620
19 years old, you know, 1819 they really didn't know worth when in fire. So share this

1089
01:49:34,620 --> 01:49:39,020
with your kid with you or if you're a kid, enjoy. Because if you're 1819, yeah, you're

1090
01:49:39,020 --> 01:49:43,140
grown up, you're still a kid in my eyes. Just a couple of updates on the things. This

1091
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:47,660
is actually some homework for you, shakalheads, the shakalheads and shakalheads

1092
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:55,280
in turn, not your now. This is a great link from Dr. Jim Howenstein, MD, and the

1093
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:59,800
title of is it why you should avoid taking vaccines. Now, there's been a lot of talk,

1094
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:06,800
you know, I've been doing my bit to warn people certainly of the dangers of these new

1095
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:13,480
vaccines, which are intended to be cash cows for the pharmaceutical industry. Oh, another

1096
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:24,240
hairball. Excuse me. That helps. Oh, man, they went down the wrong tube. What he does

1097
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:31,320
he breaks down beautifully, how vaccines actually have done very little to stop a

1098
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:37,440
horrible diseases and how actually a lot of the natural development of the world

1099
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:41,360
and our knowledge of what is good to eat and how to take care of ourselves. Probably

1100
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:49,160
helped a lot more. If anything, a lot of the vaccinations detracted from or it made

1101
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:57,400
the really hurt. Let's put it that way. And it goes all the way up through through some

1102
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:02,680
of these newer vaccines that they were talking about. So just to help spur on the conversation,

1103
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:05,840
I'd like you to take a look at that link in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

1104
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:14,840
or in the Charlie Entry at curie.com. One other thing for those of you who I am skip that,

1105
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:20,880
I'm just gonna rid of that. I'm done with that one. I'm trying to think what I should

1106
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:33,920
do next. I am suggesting with this, this is a great idea. Hey Adam, hey I'm doing it. I'm

1107
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:38,000
doing it. Okay, that's number 144 and we're gonna start right away with intro and

1108
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:51,520
be one. Oh boy. Oh man, that sounds like oh, y'all and I don't know man, I can't get it. Number two.

1109
01:51:51,760 --> 01:52:03,840
Hey, come on. Is that like, hey, come on. There's a party over here and a fantastic voyage.

1110
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:13,680
And number three. Oh, hey, that's earth wind and fire. Let's group tonight. I believe. So it's

1111
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:18,320
probably all from the 70s. I couldn't get the first one. Let's see how we do. And it's time for

1112
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:25,040
the answers and this week they're all from. Oh, take that one. And this is answer number one.

1113
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:36,480
This is Carol Gianni, hit it on the lover. I was nervous. I was nervous. I was near the 70s and

1114
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,480
we went.

1115
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:57,200
Carol Gianni is answer number one. And this is answer number two. This is Lakeside.

1116
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,360
Okay.

1117
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:25,440
Yeah, fantastic voyage. All right, Lakeside is answer number two. And this is answer number three.

1118
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:32,240
This is earth wind and fire. Let's group. Let's group tonight.

1119
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,880
Uh-huh.

1120
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:56,640
Earth wind and fire. Let's group. And answer number three. And let's conclude.

1121
01:53:56,640 --> 01:54:02,000
It's a number one, it's 44. So Adam. How did you do this week?

1122
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,000
What do you do this week?

1123
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,000
I'm poorly young.

1124
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,280
I would say that is three out of a possible six doors because they got the name of the

1125
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:11,840
band Lakeside ROM and you get the titles.

1126
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:15,120
The answers to this and the other hitest and also the links to the iTunes you can buy

1127
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:16,120

Bye-bye.

Oh man.

Thanks, Yon.

1139
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:47,360
Funny that we both had a earth wind and fire.

1140
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:50,760
Totally different vibe, totally different songs there, but thank you so much for it.

1141
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:54,200
Was it hitest number 144?

1142
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:59,720
One little update on Steve Fossard who went missing on my birthday actually, September

1143
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:05,280
3rd last year, of course he was, well I think they found his wreckage and they're not

1144
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:10,520
sure if they did actually, you know I should get an update on that on the situation there.

1145
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:16,440
If they ever found any of his remains, some hikers found his, found this billfold or some

1146
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:21,080
of his personal possessions and indeed it would look like wreckage of the airplane.

1147
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:24,760
But I remember telling you that Richard Branson had said that it was really unfortunate

1148
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:28,720
because it was working on this top secret project, something that was supposed to be really

1149
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:35,040
awesome and it had to do with submarines and this video showed up on the drop, it's a video

1150
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,040
from LiveLeague.com.

1151
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:39,320
I'm going to play this for you because it explains exactly what he was doing, link in the

1152
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:41,480
show notes so you can actually see the whole thing.

1153
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:48,000
His big secret project, this was to make a record dive to the bottom of the planet.

1154
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
This is the deep space challenger.

1155
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,840
It looks like a plane, but is actually a winged, submersible, capable of diving to the

1156
01:55:54,840 --> 01:56:00,440
Mariana Trench, a lowest spot on Earth, 37,000 feet below the surface.

1157
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:04,000
Until now, the ship has been kept under wraps in a Richmond warehouse.

1158
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,400
I would have dramatically, dramatically open the oceans for exploration.

1159
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:10,600
It would have been a game changer.

1160
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:14,800
Graham Hawks says the craft would have flown to the bottom of the ocean in an hour and

1161
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:17,480
40 minutes and then rocketed back up.

1162
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:21,960
He wouldn't say what it cost to build, but it was almost ready to launch when faucet

1163
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:22,960
disappeared.

1164
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:26,040
You would finish testing.

1165
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:32,280
All the systems have been tested under pressure at the Department of Defense facilities.

1166
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:35,480
We were four weeks away from splashing it in.

1167
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:38,680
But now that faucet has died, the project is on hold.

1168
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:48,160
Deflight challenger is just, I think, an extraordinary beautiful machine to my eyes.

1169
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:52,080
And it's not like anything else has been seen on this planet before.

1170
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:53,280
We've really got to see this thing.

1171
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:54,600
You've got to check that video.

1172
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:56,200
It's just absolutely awesome.

1173
01:56:56,200 --> 01:57:01,000
And of course, it begs the question, if it was so close from actually making that deep

1174
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:08,200
dive, and he passed away so mysteriously and did he actually pass away or he disappeared,

1175
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:13,560
you've got to ask yourself the question, is it coincidence or is there something at the

1176
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:20,240
bottom of the ocean that someone doesn't want us to know about, will there be a true

1177
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:21,240
secret down there?

1178
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:23,240
The secret of the ocean.

1179
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:24,240
Stay with me, Chocol-Heads.

1180
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:26,280
The secret of the universe is next.

1181
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:58,240
Do you want to know the secret of the ocean?

1182
01:57:58,240 --> 01:58:01,240
Do you promise not to tell?

1183
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:06,240
Do you want to know the secret of the ocean?

1184
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:09,240
Do you promise not to tell?

1185
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:13,240
Do you promise not to tell?

1186
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:15,240
Do you promise not to tell?

1187
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:17,240
Do you promise not to tell?

1188
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:19,240
Do you promise not to tell?

1189
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:20,240
Do you promise not to tell?

1190
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:21,240
Do you promise not to tell?

1191
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:22,240
Do you promise not to tell?

1192
01:58:22,240 --> 01:58:23,240
Do you promise not to tell?

1193
01:58:23,240 --> 01:58:24,240
Do you promise not to tell?

1194
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:36,240
Do you promise not to tell?

1195
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:42,240
Do you promise not to tell?

1196
01:58:42,240 --> 01:59:05,680
The Beatles. Do you want to know a secret? Well, you came to the right place, my friends.

1197
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:11,840
Chuckle heads. Something new to wind up this extraordinarily long episode of the Daily

1198
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:16,720
Source code looks like we're moving up on two hours. So if you're still with me, then it's

1199
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:25,360
going to pay off, I believe. This is now the other day after we had one of our management meetings,

1200
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:35,120
you know, we're gearing up to head into the economic tsunami, head on my partner, friend and co-founder

1201
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:43,760
of mevio. We've been in business together for 14 years now. He said, would you mind just walk

1202
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:47,440
with me to the bookstore? I want to go pick a song up and he was going to go pick a book up and I said,

1203
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:55,920
sure. And he picked up this book, which is actually, it's a really small, very small book. It has a companion

1204
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:03,440
DVD, which he offered me. But I said, no, I'd be much more interested in the book. It's called the secret

1205
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:10,080
by Ronda Burn. And I believe when this book first came out, let me just see if I can see when the

1206
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:16,000
first day it came out. I didn't read it at the time. But remember there was kind of this who

1207
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:24,720
plot around it? Does it say here? So I'm going to shoot stir, it doesn't actually give us the,

1208
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:31,920
well, not quite sure when it came out. But anyway, I'm going to recite a bit from this book.

1209
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:40,720
And you definitely need to pick this up because, you know, ever since, probably a 1989, 1990,

1210
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:48,160
I started, you know, becoming interested in things like a neural linguistic programming that's

1211
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:52,080
what we used with the sense say or experiment those of you who've been around long enough actually

1212
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:58,480
you heard a throwback to that earlier in the show where I could anchor your thoughts to something.

1213
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:04,800
So, whenever I burped, then you would automatically think since sale, the positive of power,

1214
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:11,680
the power of positive thinking, the Anthony Robbins, I've listened to all his tapes, I've read many

1215
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:16,800
many books. And I'm, you know, I've tried a lot of these, you know, business self health books,

1216
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:21,040
but that's never really worked for me. But I, I've always known that there was something

1217
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:27,120
within us all the way up to recent times where I've been in contact with people who

1218
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:34,960
talk about what might happen in 2012. And of course, visitors from outer space and our natural

1219
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:43,600
frequencies, the human frequencies of the earth. Even some of this goes to, to, when the energy

1220
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:51,840
elite captured or hijacked the development of energy and basically forced us into fossil fuels,

1221
02:01:52,800 --> 02:02:00,160
things that people like Tesla were into. Anyway, it's the book is called the secret and I'll just

1222
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:05,920
start off from going to read a couple paragraphs here for you starting off with what is the secret.

1223
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:09,840
This is, and I guess what they did is they went out the interview to hold a bunch of people and this

1224
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:15,520
can be found on the DVD. This is a Bob Proctor. You're probably sitting there wondering,

1225
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:22,960
what is the secret? I'll tell you how I've come to understand it. We all work with one infinite

1226
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:29,680
power. We all guide ourselves by exactly the same laws. The natural laws of the universe are so

1227
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:36,080
precise that we don't even have any difficulty building spaceships. We can send people to the moon.

1228
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:42,800
We can time the landing with the precision of a fraction of a second, wherever you are, India,

1229
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:49,520
Australia, New Zealand, Stockholm, London, Toronto, Montreal, New York. We're all working with

1230
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:57,120
one power, one law. It's attraction. The secret is the law of attraction.

1231
02:02:58,160 --> 02:03:04,640
Everything that's coming into your life, you are attracting into your life. And it's attracted to

1232
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:09,680
you by virtue of the images you're holding in your mind. It's what you're thinking.

1233
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:17,120
Whatever is going on in your mind, you are attracting to you. Now let me continue here.

1234
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:23,920
The greatest teachers who have ever lived have told us that the law of attraction is indeed the

1235
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:30,240
most powerful law in the universe. Poets, like William Shakespeare, Robert Browning, William Blake,

1236
02:03:30,240 --> 02:03:35,520
delivered it in their poetry. Musicians such as Ludwig von Beethoven expressed it through their music

1237
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:40,400
artists, such as Leonardo da Vinci, depicted it in their paintings. Great thinkers, including

1238
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:47,120
Socrates Plato, Ralph Waldo, Emerson, Patagarras, Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Isaac Newton,

1239
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:52,720
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Victor Hugo shared it in their writings and teachings.

1240
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:57,440
Their names have been immortalized and their legendary existence has survived centuries.

1241
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:04,560
Religion, such as Hinduism, hermetic traditions, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam,

1242
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:09,120
and civilization, such as the ancient Babylonians and the Egyptians delivered it with their

1243
02:04:09,120 --> 02:04:15,200
writings and stories thousands of years ago. Recorded throughout the ages in all its forms,

1244
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:20,800
the law can be found in ancient writings throughout all the centuries. It was recorded in stone

1245
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:27,280
in 3000 BC. Even though some coveted this knowledge and indeed they did, it was always and

1246
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:34,080
has always been there for anyone to discover. The law began at the beginning of time. It has

1247
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:40,880
always been and will always be. It is the law that determines the complete order in the universe.

1248
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:45,200
Every moment of your life and every single thing you experience in your life,

1249
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:50,800
doesn't matter who you are or where you are. The law of attraction is forming your entire life

1250
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:57,200
experience and this all-powerful law is doing that through your thoughts. You are the one who

1251
02:04:57,200 --> 02:05:04,320
calls the law of attraction into action and you do it through your thoughts. A perfect example

1252
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:09,440
to demonstrate the secret and the law of attraction is this one. Now you may know or heard of people

1253
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:15,680
who acquired massive wealth, lost it all and within a short time acquired massive wealth again.

1254
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:21,280
What happened in these cases, whether they knew it or not, is that their dominant thoughts

1255
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:26,800
were unwell. That's how they acquired wealth in the first instance. Then they allowed fearful

1256
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:33,200
thoughts of losing the wealth to enter their minds until those fearful thoughts of loss became

1257
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:38,560
their dominant thoughts. That tip the scales from thinking thoughts of wealth to thinking thoughts

1258
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:44,800
of loss and so they lost it all. Once they had lost it, however, the fear of loss disappeared

1259
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:51,760
and they tip the scales back with dominant thoughts of wealth and wealth returned. The law responds

1260
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:57,600
to your thoughts no matter what they may be. Well, of course, is just one example you could

1261
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:03,200
wish for health, you could wish for happiness, you could wish for anything you want. That's the beauty

1262
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:09,840
of the law of the attraction, the true secret to the universe. Janasarov says in the book,

1263
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:15,360
the simplest way for me to look at the law of attraction as if I think of myself as a magnet.

1264
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:21,760
And I know that a magnet will attract things to it. You are the most powerful magnet in the

1265
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:28,160
universe. You contain a magnetic power within you that is more powerful than anything in this world.

1266
02:06:28,160 --> 02:06:34,880
And this unfathomable magnetic power is emitted through your thoughts. Now, I know this sounds

1267
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:41,120
crazy, but I wouldn't be reading this to you if I didn't absolutely 100% believe it and have

1268
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:49,200
seen this happening in my own life time, oh, and time again. And this is the interesting thing.

1269
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:55,440
When you're thinking these thoughts, the thoughts, the magnet doesn't understand the word

1270
02:06:55,440 --> 02:07:01,440
don't or can't or any negative connotations. You can't say, I don't want to become sick.

1271
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:08,880
That doesn't work. You have to think it positive, I want to be healthy. It's not like I don't

1272
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:13,680
want to become poor. If you're thinking, I don't want to become poor. You're going to become poor.

1273
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:22,000
Whatever poor is in your realm, whatever poor is in your destiny, but thinking in a negative

1274
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:25,760
connotation does not work. That's not how you turn the magnet on.

1275
02:07:28,640 --> 02:07:33,600
Okay, here's another favorite part that I liked in this book. Thoughts are magnetic and thoughts

1276
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:41,520
have a frequency. As you think, those thoughts are sent out into the universe and they magnetically

1277
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:49,200
attract all like things that are on the same frequency. Everything sent out returns to the source

1278
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:55,280
and that source is you. Think of it this way. We understand that a television station's

1279
02:07:55,280 --> 02:08:02,000
transmission tower broadcast via a frequency which is transformed into pictures on your television.

1280
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:07,600
Most of us don't really understand how it works, but we know that each channel has a frequency.

1281
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:12,160
And when we tune into that frequency, we see the pictures on our television,

1282
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:17,840
which shows the frequency by selecting the channel and we then receive the pictures broadcast on

1283
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:23,520
that channel. If you want to see different pictures on our television, we change the channel

1284
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:30,960
and tune into a new frequency. You are a human transmission tower and you are more powerful than

1285
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:35,840
any television tower created on earth. You are the most powerful transmission tower in the

1286
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:42,240
universe. Your transmission creates your life and it creates your world. The frequency you

1287
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:48,400
transmit reaches beyond cities, beyond countries, beyond the world. It reverberates throughout

1288
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:55,520
the entire universe and you are transmitting that frequency with your thoughts. Pictures you receive

1289
02:08:55,520 --> 02:09:00,160
from the transmission of your thoughts are not on a television screen near living room. They are

1290
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:06,080
the pictures of your life. Your thoughts create the frequency. They attract like things on that

1291
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:12,880
frequency and then they are broadcast back to you as your life pictures. If you want to change anything

1292
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:20,000
in your life, change the channel and change the frequency by changing your thoughts. Chocolate heads

1293
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:26,880
by using the law of attraction, the secret of the universe. We can change the world and make it a

1294
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:35,040
better place. Think about the generations and they want to make it a better place for children

1295
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:44,640
and their children's children so that they know it's a better world for them. They can make it a better

1296
02:09:44,640 --> 02:10:00,400
place. There's a place in your heart and I know that it is not. It's a place

1297
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:11,360
was brighter than tomorrow. If you have a try, if you find there's no need to cry, it's a

1298
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:22,880
place, but there's no better sorrow. There are ways to get there. If you care enough for the living,

1299
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:36,320
make a little space. Make a better place. You'll do whatever you want. Make it a better place for you and

1300
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:47,600
me and me and I are human beings. There are people right. You care enough for them and make a better

1301
02:10:47,600 --> 02:11:02,400
place for you and for me. If you want to know why, there's a love that cannot lie. Love is strong,

1302
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:12,640
you don't need care for your forgive me. We try, just see, and this place we cannot feel.

1303
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:24,480
Stop existing and start living. There's a better ways, love is going

1304
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:38,320
Make a better world. Make a better world. You'll do whatever you want. Make it a better place for you and

1305
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:49,920
for me and me and I are human beings. There are people right. If you care enough for them and make a better

1306
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:58,800
place for you and for me and I are human beings. There are people right. You don't need to cry for you and

1307
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:04,480
me and I are human beings. There are people right. You don't need to cry for your forgive me. You don't need to cry for your

1308
02:12:34,480 --> 02:12:47,040
happiness. There are people right. You don't need to cry for your forgive me. You don't need to cry for your

1309
02:12:47,520 --> 02:13:01,200
and make a better world. Make a better world. Make a better world. Make a better place for you and

1310
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:12,960
for me and I are human beings. There are people right. Make a better world. Make a better world. Make a better

1311
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:27,120
place for you and for me and you are human beings. Make a better place for you and for me and

1312
02:13:27,120 --> 02:13:34,560

1313
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:48,960
and for me and I are human beings. There are people right. Make a better world. Make a better world. Make a better world.

1317
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:23,440
create the picture in your mind, make it happen in that picture that is changing your

1318
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:29,400
frequency. It is turning on your magnet. It is attracting different particles of the same

1319
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:34,680
frequency to your magnet to your life. And because we're all connected, if you make your

1320
02:15:34,680 --> 02:15:38,920
life better, all of our lives are going to be better. And focus on what you really want

1321
02:15:38,920 --> 02:15:42,760
to achieve. Because we're going to have to do it. And the only way to do it is to become

1322
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:47,880
aware. Not to become aware of the world around us. We talked a lot about that on today's

1323
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:54,200
anniversary episode of the Daily Source Code and 800 episodes. I've never thought how

1324
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:59,560
it would get here. But we're here. And we have this opportunity. And now that you

1325
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:04,400
know that there is something within all of us. And this is my personal, you know, my

1326
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:08,400
own secret. And it's worked very well for me. I've been extremely happy, extremely

1327
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:13,640
healthy and very successful. And it's not just because I'm a lucky bastard. You create

1328
02:16:13,640 --> 02:16:18,480
your own luck. You created by attracting that, attracting what you want. You're going to

1329
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:23,080
need that. It's a part of your tool set. We're all going to have to bond this together.

1330
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:27,120
And if we all focus, and if we all create a better world in our minds, and I want to get

1331
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:32,200
a lot of feedback from you guys. There's a voicemail number. You can call, uh, listed on

1332
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:37,520
the drop, uh, drop.au slash daily source code or upload something. Tell me your experiences.

1333
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:42,320
Tell me that if you've been using it, if you've tried it out, if it's worked for you,

1334
02:16:42,320 --> 02:16:48,760
you will be absolutely amazed when we all bond together. And we create a massive magnet

1335
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:53,680
on one frequency. I'm telling you, we'll be unstoppable.

1336
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:58,360
Juggle heads, thanks for hanging out for this special edition of the daily source code, 800

1337
02:16:58,360 --> 02:17:02,960
episodes. Next week, when I get back to the UK, we're going to pick up and do a couple

1338
02:17:02,960 --> 02:17:07,360
a week. And there'll be a little bit shorter. But I think the format is kind of working.

1339
02:17:07,360 --> 02:17:12,760
Until then, enjoy your freedom, enjoy your power, and live your life with passion.

1340
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:16,360
Another fine, medium presentation. Stick it in your ear.
