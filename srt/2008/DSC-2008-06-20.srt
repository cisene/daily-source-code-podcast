1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
All right, let's pray.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's pray.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's pray.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's pray.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Got a rock.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Got a rock.

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Got a rock.

8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Got a rock.

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Thank you for this chance to kick us.

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Kick us.

11
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Kick us.

12
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We are your humble servants.

13
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Please give us the power to blow people's minds

14
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
with our high voltage rock.

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is this.

16
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You think it will be so soon.

17
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And the battery.

18
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
One two three,

19
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
one two three.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Sixteen million dollars worth of airplay

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
strapped by us.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
To the next generation,

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
radio content in my ears.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We don't need enough.

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Dealing,

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
breathing,

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I like how you think I'm flying

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
into this jerk.

29
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I guess it is a curry.

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It was my teenage night.

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My thoughts were short.

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
My hair was long.

33
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Caught somewhere between it for a man.

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
She was 17.

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
She was far from in between.

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It was summertime and northern this year.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Splash me through the fan bar.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Talking about the campfire.

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's the simple things in life.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Like when and where.

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We didn't have no internet.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh man, I never will forget.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Way to move like shine upon her head.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And we were trying different things.

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And we were smoking, throwing things.

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Making her a lovely, draw me red song.

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Look, sit in whiskey out the ground.

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Not taking bottom all up.

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
See the heat, oh man, I'm all summer long.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
See the sweet, oh man, I'm all summer long.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Getting all up from the dark.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Watching the waves roll off the rocks.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You'll fall ever, hold a spot inside my soul.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
With this thrilling sun.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We couldn't wait for night to come.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
To hit that same place, rock your roll.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
While we were trying different things.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And we were smoking, throwing things.

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Making her a lovely, draw me red song.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Getting all up from the whiskey out the ground.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Not taking bottom all up.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
See the sweet, oh man, I'm all summer long.

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Looking at the sweet, oh man, I'm all summer long.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hey kids, there's this kid rock and this whole thing,

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and the bait and downloading music.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
A legal name stealing that I guess you was just really gone way too far.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I mean, it's like a company swing kids.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The kids are writing something you know, you can only go down low.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
My music's still. If you're welcome, you're on a duck, I'm fucking rich.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And so how can I bitch about someone down low in the summer?

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm just like, you know, we can only go down low in my music.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,440
Fucking rich, and so how can I bitch about someone down low in the song or two?

73
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,720
I really can't, but what I'd like to encourage all of you to do at this point, let's level the playing field.

74
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,480
Still, everything.

75
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,920
Now nothing seems to strange as when the leads begin to change.

76
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,640
Oh, how we thought those things would never end.

77
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,120
Sometimes they hate that song, and I'll start to sing along.

78
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,320
And think man, I'd love to see that girl again.

79
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:55,840
And we tried different things, and we were smoking on a thing, making all I want to make to believe and so.

80
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
Hell yeah.

81
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,880
The whiskey of the bottle, now they get out to my heart, sing it and we all know.

82
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,640
And then you got to love that for a footballer Friday kick off.

83
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Is that right?

84
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
What?

85
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
Kidrock.

86
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,040
Oh, it's so far along.

87
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,240
Of course, little bit of the leader's skitter in there, with sweet home Alabama.

88
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,880
And of course, you said we could steal the song, so what better way to kick off the

89
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,880
footballer Friday?

90
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Hey, everybody.

91
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
It is Daddy Sorskord episode.

92
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,800
First, 771 coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey, known as Gulford.

93
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:33,160
This is the footballer Friday music expressed free train blasting through your pots, Jim and

94
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,400
your ear, but it ooze around your brain.

95
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:47,640
I stop and I'm thinking about the life I can't breathe out, watching another

96
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,520
fall of the other, like faith that's the way it is.

97
00:04:52,520 --> 00:05:01,080
These days I'm feeling good at this morning, and it's mainly crazy, but I was fairly

98
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:13,200
born, but I have learned to feel alive, but I must be out of my mind, to act this way,

99
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:21,240
I still feel all the same, and I'm okay, but when you're seen in it, it's one thing

100
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:30,080
you can expect, and if I can't see it, it'll all be in my mind, and it's all

101
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:38,080
in my mind, to act this way, but I must be out of my mind, to act this way, but I must be out of

102
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,080
my mind, to act this way, but when you're seen in it, it's all in my mind, to act

103
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:51,080
this way, but when you're seen in it, it's all in my mind, to act this way, but when you're

104
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:58,080
seen in it, it's all in my mind, to act this way, but when you're seen in it, it's all in

105
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:07,080
my mind, to act this way, but when you're seen in it, it's all in my mind, to act

106
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,080
this way, but I still feel all the same, and I'm okay, but when you're seen in it, it's

107
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:22,080
one thing you can expect, and if I can't see it, it'll all be in my mind, to act

108
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,080
in it, it's all in my mind, to act this way, but when you're seen in it, it's all in my mind, to act

109
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,080
It's not enough for me

110
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,080
All the faces all the pain you want to say

111
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,080
I think you want to say

112
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,080
I think I want to smile

113
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,080
I must be half of my mind

114
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
To have this way

115
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,080
I still have all this time

116
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
But I'm okay

117
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
But will you see me next

118
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
Or take your hands with me

119
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,080
I can't see the love me

120
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,080
I love the love I used to be

121
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
I love my mind

122
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
To have this way

123
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,080
I still have all this time

124
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
I'm okay

125
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,080
But will you see me next

126
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,080
I can't see the hell me

127
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Out of my mind

128
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
I can't see the hell me

129
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
This thing just appeared on the floor

130
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
My mind

131
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
What is it?

132
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
Take a screenshot

133
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
I think or a screenshot

134
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
Out of my mind

135
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
I saw it on the pond

136
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
Same music network

137
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
I'm like, whoa

138
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
After I listen to it

139
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
This is awesome

140
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
Fantastic stuff

141
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
And I've got more like that

142
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
For you on today's daily source code

143
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
And I was actually going to jam

144
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Right through and play a whole

145
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
I'm going to hold a whole bunch of stuff

146
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
Line up of course

147
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
I've got a hit test to go

148
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,080
Got some soundtracks

149
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
From the soundtrack

150
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
To my life

151
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
Which hopefully will be added to yours today

152
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,080
But then I came across

153
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,080
You know there's a couple of shows

154
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
That I subscribe to

155
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
You can check out my on the go channel

156
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
Which is pretty much the one I listened to

157
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Every day

158
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
I just click it in the morning

159
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,080
It's atom.podshow.com

160
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Really easy to figure out

161
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
And remember

162
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,080
And one of the shows I have in there

163
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
is the BBC Newspot

164
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Which is fantastic

165
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
Because it's really

166
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
It's like an aggregate

167
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
Of all of the best bits

168
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,080
Of all the BBC radio shows

169
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
From the previous day

170
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
So of course there's a lot of

171
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Radio 4, Radio 5

172
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
It's mainly talk stuff and interviews

173
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
But the highlights are usually kind of

174
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
Pulled right out

175
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
And I came across something

176
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
I just wanted to share with you guys

177
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
Because it'll blow your mind

178
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
When you hear it

179
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
Hold on a second

180
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
Let me just make sure

181
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
I've got all

182
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,080
Q to properly hear

183
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
Hold on

184
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Now I'm not quite sure

185
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,080
What the show is

186
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Which program it's taken from

187
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
Which of course

188
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
I'll have to look for later

189
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
And put into the show notes

190
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,080
But essentially it's a journalist

191
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Who covers Afghanistan

192
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,080
And I think it's a general

193
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
I think

194
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
And this is from the

195
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
You know the British services

196
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Now you have to understand

197
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
Then the past

198
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Was it two weeks or last month

199
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Nine

200
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
Nine boys and girls

201
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
Actually I think eight boys

202
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
And one girl

203
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
Come back dead

204
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
And from Afghanistan

205
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
And I'm really

206
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
And they show the coffins

207
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
Here on TV by the way

208
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
At least I've seen one

209
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,080
Maybe it's just stock footage

210
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Who the hell knows

211
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,080
But it's starting to become a point of discussion here

212
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
Obviously as it should be

213
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
Because there's a

214
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,080
7 or 8,000 British troops in Afghanistan

215
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
And there's a lot of troops

216
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
Of countries around the world

217
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
Because it's a NATO effort

218
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
Now what does that mean?

219
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
Exactly

220
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Well listen to this bit

221
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Very surprised

222
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
I'll jump in

223
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,080
And point out some of the things that I find interesting from the soundbites

224
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
In the last 10 days

225
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Nine British soldiers have died in Afghanistan

226
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
Including one woman

227
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Their deaths have prompted yet more questions

228
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,080
About the success of the current military operation

229
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Five lives Stephen Chittendon

230
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,080
Went to the Garrison town of Colchester in England

231
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
And spoke to the wife of one serviceman

232
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Who's in Afghanistan

233
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Actually this is

234
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,080
So that's just the beginning of the piece

235
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
I want to get to that guy who called

236
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
I think he Campbell spoke to them both

237
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
And began by asking Colonel Mike Juer

238
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
There we go

239
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,080
British forces in Afghanistan

240
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Great question

241
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,080
Why are the forces there?

242
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Here we go

243
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
We're not just asking

244
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
Of course the fact is NATO was there

245
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
There are 47,000 troops there

246
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
And 27 nations

247
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
That's the point

248
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
It's not a matter of Britain being there

249
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,080
It's a matter of the west in general

250
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Being there for its own self interest

251
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
That's why we're there

252
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
He just said in an article

253
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,080
And there was never said why we're there

254
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Well that's rubbish

255
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
I'm close to him

256
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,080
I'm so many times I'm in a sick of you

257
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Notice this tactic

258
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
We've said it so many times

259
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Where they're there

260
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
So countless number of times

261
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
There were sick of telling you why we're there

262
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
That's a very interesting tactic

263
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Because I bet you

264
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,080
If I go out on the street

265
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
I don't think even half or half of the people you ask

266
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,080
Would actually know the standard answer

267
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
Bring it

268
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
Why we out there

269
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,080
Where there to prevent Afghanistan

270
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,080
They're coming the base

271
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,080
It was when it night eleven was launched from there

272
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
Now

273
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
Let's just replay that little bit

274
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Okay

275
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Remember

276
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Britain also went into Iraq

277
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,080
With United States based upon evidence

278
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
Of terrorism

279
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,080
Links

280
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
And of course the weapons of mass destruction

281
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
But

282
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
Terrorism

283
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,080
We went into Iraq because that's where all the bad guys were

284
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Right

285
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
Isn't that right?

286
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,080
Well nine eleven was launched from Afghanistan

287
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Is what he's saying

288
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
Let's just listen to that again

289
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Make sure I heard it right

290
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
And they were never said why were there

291
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Well that's rubbish

292
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
It's been said simpler times

293
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
Some so many times

294
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
That one sick of hearing it

295
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Why we out there

296
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Where there to prevent Afghanistan

297
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
They're coming the base it

298
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Whilst when it night eleven was launched from there

299
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
And when it was a sanctuary for terrorism

300
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,080
And a headquarters for world terrorists

301
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
And that's why we're with there

302
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
Is it also about

303
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,080
Providing democracy and making sure

304
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,080
And there is a quality of women

305
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
As much as it can be

306
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
And education

307
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
All those things still important

308
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
Yeah

309
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
What a great question

310
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
So of course the guy says

311
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
No it's our terrorism

312
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,080
It's not about any pipelines

313
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
Don't look at the pipelines

314
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
The place

315
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,080
And it's not the pipelines

316
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
It's a terrorism

317
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Yeah I'm glad you brought that up about women and children

318
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Well of course

319
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
Of course they are

320
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,080
I mean like you go on with a whole range of reasons

321
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
I'm trying to be succinct

322
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
And give you one main reason

323
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
But if you want me to go on for hours

324
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
I could go on for hours

325
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,080
Oh I must say there's so many reasons

326
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
We are there

327
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
I could go on for hours

328
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,080
Of course

329
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
Of course

330
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Of course there are all those reason

331
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Peter also just manages those reasons

332
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
And he's right

333
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,080
They cannot be achieved easily or quickly

334
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,080
And that doesn't mean you shouldn't try

335
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,080
The army is only creating space

336
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,080
You can't win a war

337
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,080
A war like this

338
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Any way you can win some wars

339
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
By purely military means

340
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
But a war like this

341
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
You cannot of course

342
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
And Peter and I'm sure we would agree with that

343
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,080
You can only create space

344
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,080
How does that mean?

345
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,080
You can only create space

346
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
The final frontier

347
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,080
You're making a fool of yourself Colonel

348
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,080
For other influences to work

349
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
And those may take you

350
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,080
You only have to look at all the confidence he was

351
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
Since 1945

352
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
Okay

353
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Taking up to 30 years

354
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Some of taking 10 years

355
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
Some 15, some 20

356
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
Oh we could be there forever

357
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,080
Trying to take a long, long time

358
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
But we're not

359
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,080
We lost Peter's line

360
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
But we've got him on the phone

361
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
He was at Peter

362
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
Yes I am

363
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
So this is about this is getting ugly in a second here

364
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Nothing I'm afraid

365
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,080
But I think I know what it probably was

366
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
Now listen to this

367
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
This is the reporter right

368
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
It's a journalist and he's going to give

369
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
His opinion

370
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,080
About eradicating terrorist training camps

371
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
And making sure they aren't re-established

372
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
And rebuilding society

373
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
I'm sorry

374
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
But this is completely unrealistic

375
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
We have what is it

376
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,080
Eight thousand troops in Afghanistan

377
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,080
And one more province in one part of it

378
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,080
The president of Afghanistan

379
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
He was supposed to be supporting barely control

380
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
His own bedroom

381
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
I like that

382
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,080
The president of Afghanistan

383
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,080
The one that wears a lamb feed

384
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,080
This is on his head

385
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,080
He can barely control his own bedroom

386
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
Did I miss something that I missed

387
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
I'm kind of scandal somewhere

388
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
With Karzai

389
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,080
I must have missed something

390
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
I have to look that one out

391
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,080
The country is mainly run by warlords

392
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
The various reasons

393
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Which we've been said to be

394
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,080
All actually empty

395
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,080
We are incapable of preventing

396
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,080
The Taliban from operating with Taliban

397
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,080
I've seen most of the best two people

398
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
Many people live in Afghanistan

399
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Many guys thanks to a badly drawn border

400
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,080
From 1871

401
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,080
No British or any other part

402
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
As ever succeeded in obtaining control

403
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Ever Afghanistan by military means

404
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,080
We would try to act twice in the 19th century

405
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,080
The idea that with our peaceful military results

406
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,080
We can't even afford to protect our soldiers

407
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,080
That idea that with our peaceful military results

408
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
We can achieve more than the Russians did

409
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
With hundreds of thousands of troops

410
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
And to be in charge of getting to the country

411
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
It is frankly ridiculous

412
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
You really need to hear this whole thing

413
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
So I'll put a link in the show

414
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
No, so you can listen to it

415
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
Meanwhile

416
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
Check out

417
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
The way you support

418
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
The 4th

419
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
The 4th

420
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
The 1st

421
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
The 1st

422
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,080
The 1st

423
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,080
The protest is alive and well my friends

424
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,080
And behind the 4th image of the son of man

425
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
It shall stand

426
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,080
And it's in hip hop

427
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
Crank this up

428
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
Listen to the message

429
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,080
But it's important

430
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
And it's about all of us

431
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
Of all colors

432
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Yeah

433
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
Yeah

434
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Yeah

435
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,080
Yeah

436
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,080
Yeah

437
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Yeah

438
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
Yeah

439
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,080
Yeah

440
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Yeah

441
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
The voice of racism

442
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,080
Region of gospel is devilish

443
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,080
A fake church called the prophet Muhammad terrorist

444
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,080
We're getting call is not religion

445
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
But a spiritual bond

446
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,080
And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Quran

447
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,080
He bombed innocent people trying to murder the dumb

448
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,080
When you gave them those chemical weapons to go to war

449
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,080
This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings

450
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,080
This kind of lease of rice

451
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
It's just the new age Sally Hemings

452
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
I break it down with critical language

453
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
And spiritual anguish

454
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,080
The truth is that hang with the guilt of the train

455
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Christ to murder them stole his religion

456
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
And painted them white

457
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Translated and psychologically painted philosophy

458
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
Conservative political right wing

459
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Ideology

460
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Clube together

461
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,080
Slappily the blasphemy of a nation

462
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
Got my back to the wall

463
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,080
Cause I'm facing assassination

464
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,080
Quantanamo Bay

465
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Federal incarceration

466
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
How could it be

467
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
The land of the free

468
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
The home of the brave

469
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,080
Indigenous holocaust

470
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,080
And the home of the slaves

471
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,080
Corporate America

472
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,080
It's an offbeat to the rhythm

473
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,080
You really think this country

474
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,080
Never sponsor terrorism

475
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
Human rights violations

476
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,080
We can sing through the saga

477
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,080
El Salvador

478
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,080
And the country's in Nicaragua

479
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
And no one top of that

480
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,080
You still want to take me to prison

481
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
Just cause I won't trade humanity

482
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
For patriotism

483
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
It's like M.K.O.Sra

484
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,080
Controlling your brains

485
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
And just thinking

486
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
For the new perspective

487
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
The change

488
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
They want to rearrange

489
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,080
The whole point of view

490
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
With a ghetto

491
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,080
The fourth branch of the government

492
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
Once to settle

493
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
A bent in a full of glittering

494
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
General justice

495
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,080
Fightin' for freedom

496
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,080
And fighting terror

497
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,080
For what's reality

498
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
No freedom

499
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,080
Not the history

500
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
But a place that we live in

501
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,080
Stop letting corporate news

502
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,080
Tell lies to your children

503
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,080
Like the blood of Abraham

504
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,080
Through the truth

505
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
And the arrows

506
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
Prooking upon

507
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
Like a woman's heart

508
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,080
Abused in the marriage

509
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,080
The brink of holy war

510
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,080
Modeled up

511
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
Like a miscarriage

512
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
And bedded

513
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Correspondent

514
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,080
Don't tell the source of attention

515
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
And they refuse

516
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
The even mention

517
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,080
You're a peon

518
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
Intervention

519
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
Or the massacres

520
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
And Jeanine

521
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,080
The innocent screams

522
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,080
US manufactured missiles

523
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
And M.S.S.T.s

524
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
Weapon contracts

525
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
And corrupted American dreams

526
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
Media censorship

527
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
Locking out the video

528
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,080
Screams

529
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,080
A continent of oil

530
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,080
Kingdoms

531
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
For Morgan, democracy is just the world

532
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,080
And the people are starving

533
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,080
And average citizens

534
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,080
Made to be blind

535
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
To the reason

536
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
And deserts full of genocide

537
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
What a body is freezing

538
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,080
And the world doesn't believe

539
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
That you're fighting for freedom

540
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
Because you fought the Middle East

541
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,080
And gave birth to a demon

542
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
It's open season

543
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
With the CIA

544
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,080
Boking my crib

545
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,080
Trapped in a ghetto region

546
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,080
Like a Palestinian kid

547
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
When nobody gives a fuck

548
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
Whether you die you live

549
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,080
I'm trying to give the truth

550
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
And I know the price is my life

551
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,080
But when I'm gone

552
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
No singing song about immortal technique

553
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
Who'd be headed to president

554
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
And the prince isn't sheaks

555
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,080
You don't give a fuck about us

556
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,080
I can see for your facade

557
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,080
Like a fuller name

558
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
You're standing in the presence of God

559
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
Bitch, make a scare to the truth

560
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
When it looks at you hard

561
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,080
It's like M.K. Oldtrog control

562
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
And your brains

563
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,080
Just thinking

564
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,080
For the new perspective

565
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,080
The change

566
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,080
That what a real range

567
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
The whole point of view

568
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
And it ghetto

569
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
The fourth branch

570
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
That government

571
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
One is to settle

572
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,080
A band in a fuller clittering

573
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
Gender rather defighting for freedom

574
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
And fighting terror

575
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
But what's reality

576
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
Much along is coming soon

577
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
To the hood

578
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
To kill you

579
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
While you hang in your flag

580
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
Out your project window

581
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,080
Damn

582
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
The fourth branch

583
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
That government

584
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
A.K. The media seems to now

585
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
Have a retirement plan

586
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
For ex-military officials

587
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,080
As if their opinion

588
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,080
Was at all unbiased

589
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
On my sheeps

590
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Should speak for men

591
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,080
So shut the fuck up

592
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,080
Your mindless home

593
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,080
And you know it's serious

594
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
When he's saying media outfits

595
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
A spending millions of dollars

596
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,080
On a PR campaign

597
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,080
To try to convince you

598
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,080
Their fair and balanced

599
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
When there's someone

600
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
A most ignorant

601
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
And racist people

602
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
It's giving that type of mentality

603
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
A safe haven

604
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,080
We act like we share

605
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
In the spoils of water

606
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,080
They do

607
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
We die in the wars

608
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,080
We don't get the contract

609
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,080
To make money

610
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,080
Or for afterwards

611
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
We don't get weapons

612
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,080
Contracts nigger

613
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
We don't get cheap labour

614
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,080
For companies nigger

615
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,080
We aren't cheap labour

616
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,080
Nigger

617
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Turn off the news

618
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,080
And read nigger

619
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,080
Read

620
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
Immortal technique

621
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
The fourth branch

622
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
And although maybe directed directly

623
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
At the ghetto

624
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,080
I sometimes feel in the

625
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,080
Immortal words of Stevie Wonder

626
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,080
We all live in a villa

627
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
Village ghetto land

628
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,080
That's uh

629
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
That's powerful stuff, man

630
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,080
That of course was found on the source code drop.io

631
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,080
Dash or slash daily source code

632
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
Fantastic track

633
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
Really really like that

634
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,080
And well just on the topic for another moment here

635
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,080
A couple of people sent this to me including

636
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Parkie

637
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,080
Uh

638
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Exactly according to plan

639
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,080
A rock is preparing to allow

640
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,080
Four of the biggest western oil companies

641
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,080
To renew exploitation of the country's vast

642
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,080
Reserve for the first time in almost four decades

643
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,080
This is exactly what the plan was

644
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,080
I can't remember where it was

645
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
I'm sure I can google it and find it for you

646
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,080
But there's a whole plan

647
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
This was all set up

648
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
This is all dived up

649
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
They knew exactly which companies were getting

650
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,080
Which parts of uh

651
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
Iraq for oil exploitation

652
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
And now they're getting per mission

653
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,080
So here are the companies

654
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,080
Iraq's oil ministry stepped up talks

655
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
With BP

656
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
That's uh British petroleum

657
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,080
Exxon mobile shell and total

658
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,080
After the US vice president

659
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
Mmm

660
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,080
Dick Cheney visited Iraq in March

661
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,080
Where he also pressed the government to revive

662
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,080
Efforts to pass the hydro carbon law

663
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,080
That nationalist MPs were blocking

664
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,080
So the first contracts are expected to be signed later this month

665
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,080
90% of uh Iraq's budget comes from oil revenues

666
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,080
This was exactly the plan

667
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,080
It's happening right under our noses

668
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,080
Exactly as as we knew it would happen

669
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,080
And what do I get?

670
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
One news report

671
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
This is an outrage

672
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
You got it

673
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,080
I'd like to make a motion

674
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
To rock this mother out

675
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
Your honor

676
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,080
Please don't bang that gavel

677
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,080
You can try this cowbell out

678
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,080
Let's don't give a nod

679
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
To the hardest work

680
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,080
And law here

681
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
He's Jersey Ty

682
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Yeah

683
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,080
He's Jersey Ty

684
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Oh yeah

685
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,080
Your honor

686
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,080
What do you say?

687
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,080
He might

688
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
How's it going Adam?

689
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
It's Jersey Ty

690
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
The official musical

691
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,080
Just of the

692
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,080
Chacha

693
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
So coming out of California

694
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,080
Is one of the greatest band names of all time

695
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
The band's name is Candy Graham for Mongo

696
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,080
Which of course comes from my favorite movie

697
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
Blazing Saddles

698
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
But the song man

699
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
The song I wonder

700
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Stands on its own

701
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,080
Is one of the best er guitar songs

702
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
I've ever played for Yana Fubar Friday

703
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,080
So get that tennis racket out and get ready to rock

704
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,080
Because this is Candy Graham for Mongo

705
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080
With eye wonder

706
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
Ah

707
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
The Delhi source code

708
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,080
Talk to you later buddy

709
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:47,080
Like it up

710
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,080
I was on a double dating New York City

711
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,080
We took the girls to meet us by the man

712
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,080
And then when you come round the corner

713
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,080
You look so pretty

714
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,080
I'm glad I forgot to get my Tuxedo grip

715
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:20,080
And I won't know how it is

716
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,080
I won't know how it is

717
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
We are now

718
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,080
CBD

719
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,080
My friend

720
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,080
Did like two bells

721
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,080
To me and you

722
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,080
Started kissing

723
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,080
I felt your heart beat

724
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,080
Through your tears

725
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:09,080
And I won't know how it is

726
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:16,080
I won't know where it will stay for it

727
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,080
If I can't find this ball

728
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,080
I'll feel something

729
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:29,080
I won't know how it is

730
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:39,080
I won't know how it is

731
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,080
I won't know how it is

732
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,080
If I can't find this label

733
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,080
I will definitely give you the table

734
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Everything was going perfectly

735
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,080
You can play the tab

736
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,080
You're friendly with a cab

737
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
And you roll until it's on night

738
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
Out of reach

739
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Cause you're écrit from thekey

740
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,080
Cause you're Wilton Young and somebody

741
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,080
Cause you're Wilton Young and somebody

742
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,080
Cause you're Wilton Young and somebody

743
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,080
Cause you're Wilton Young and somebody

744
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,080
Cause you're Wilton Young and somebody

745
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,080
Cause you're Wilton Young and someone

746
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
Cause you're Wilton Young and somebody

747
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,080
Cause you're Wilton Young and somebody

748
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,080
Cause you're Wilton Young and somebody

749
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,080
Cause you're Wilton Young and somebody

750
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,080
Cause you're Wilton Young and somebody

751
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,080
I want you...

752
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,080
I want you...

753
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,080
I want you...

754
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,080
I want you...

755
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,080
I want you...

756
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,080
Candy Grins from Mongo.

757
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
I wonder how it ends.

758
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,080
Well, after about 3 minutes, 48 seconds eventually, it always does.

759
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
Thank you very much, sir.

760
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,080
You're as he taught official musicologist of the Daily Source Code, always there on a Friday

761
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,080
when you need him when we have an actual football Friday scheduled planned and executed.

762
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,080
Now, I'm going to do the head test for you, but I've gotten some complaints about the year.

763
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,080
Yes.

764
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,080
Hello?

765
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,080
Hello.

766
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,080
Yeah, I've been in the same lens.

767
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,080
Hmm, mate.

768
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,080
Now, I've got a little bone to pick with you.

769
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,080
I spoke with scoring on the head test.

770
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,080
Now, I think it's about some we introduced some figure into the scoring.

771
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,080
We're taking half a point here and a three-quarters of a point there.

772
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
It really isn't on.

773
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,080
What we need to do is we need to implement the following scoring system.

774
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,080
All right.

775
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,080
If you get...

776
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,080
The name of the artist's correct, you get one point.

777
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
One point.

778
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,080
You get the name of the track, right?

779
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,080
You get one point.

780
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
Okay.

781
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,080
So if you get both right, you get two points.

782
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
Right.

783
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,080
And if you get all three right, you get six points.

784
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,080
Right. Got it.

785
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,080
I think that will give us a good baseline for moving forward.

786
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,080
And if anyone wants to go back through the head test,

787
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,080
and do some statistical analysis.

788
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,080
I think that will be fairly splendid.

789
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
No, I don't think so.

790
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,080
I'm back to work.

791
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
I'm off to Orlando.

792
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
I'm Sunday.

793
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,080
The Bahamas on the Wednesday afternoon.

794
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,080
And over to LA at the end of July.

795
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,080
So I'm not traveling too much for the moment.

796
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,080
Take care.

797
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Don't forget.

798
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
They work for us.

799
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,080
The official sign off of the chat chat.

800
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,080
Okay. So I've got it.

801
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,080
One point for the artist.

802
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,080
One point for the track.

803
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,080
Six total possible points possible.

804
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
Possibility.

805
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
Wise.

806
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,080
Okay.

807
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Let's do it.

808
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
One point for the casting.

809
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
We've had a jury.

810
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,080
This is the hit test.

811
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Hit it.

812
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,080
Hit it.

813
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,080
Young pole.

814
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,080
Hey.

815
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,080
Hey Adam.

816
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,080
This is hit test number 127.

817
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,080
All right.

818
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,080
We're going to start right away with intro.

819
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
Number one.

820
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
Hit me.

821
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,080
I know that one.

822
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,080
It's the cars and drives.

823
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,080
He's going to drive home.

824
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,080
Tonight. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy.

825
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,080
Feeling good.

826
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,080
Number two.

827
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,080
Cockroven.

828
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,080
Cockroven.

829
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,080
That's going to be one star only for that one.

830
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,080
Crap.

831
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,080
And number three.

832
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,080
Madonna.

833
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
Madonna.

834
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,080
Express yourself.

835
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,080
Express yourself.

836
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,080
Okay.

837
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,080
I think according to the official scoring.

838
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,080
I have five out of six possible.

839
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,080
The answer.

840
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
All right.

841
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
Yes.

842
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
Number one.

843
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
The cars.

844
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
Ninety four.

845
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Who's going to take win?

846
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,080
It's you.

847
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
Just go on.

848
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
We're going to take you home.

849
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,080
And we're going to have it tonight.

850
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
There we are.

851
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,080
The young pull-up master makes here.

852
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
Answer number one.

853
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,080
And hit that number one hundred twenty seven.

854
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,080
The cars and drives.

855
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,080
Answer number two.

856
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,080
Ninety eighty seven.

857
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
Cockroven.

858
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
Yeah.

859
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,080
This is just the wrong corner.

860
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
That's the force.

861
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,080
Oh, man.

862
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,080
I love that cock.

863
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,080
Okay.

864
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
One star on that one.

865
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,080
They all sound alike.

866
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
Answer number two.

867
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,080
Cockroven and just around the corner.

868
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,080
Oh yeah.

869
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,080
It's the answer number three.

870
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,080
Yeah.

871
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,080
Five out of ten.

872
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,080
This is express yourself.

873
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,080
Hi.

874
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,080
You have done it.

875
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,080
Come on.

876
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Three.

877
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Two.

878
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,080
Eight.

879
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,080
Care it.

880
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,080
Two.

881
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,080
Express yourself.

882
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
You've got to make it.

883
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,080
Express yourself.

884
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
Hey.

885
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,080
Hey.

886
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
Hey.

887
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,080
So if you want it right now.

888
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,080
Make it show you how.

889
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,080
Express what you've got.

890
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,080
We'll be ready for nothing.

891
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
We'll spend it.

892
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
But Donna's answer number three.

893
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
And that concludes this hit edge.

894
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,080
And it's number one hundred and twenty seven.

895
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,080
Feeling good.

896
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,080
So Adam.

897
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
How did you do this?

898
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
Well, John.

899
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,080
The point is the new scoring system.

900
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,080
Five out of six points.

901
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,080
You want to check out the info about this and any other hit edge.

902
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,080
You can go through hit edge.

903
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,080
That beefy out.com.

904
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
And that's also the place to find links.

905
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,080
One, two.

906
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,080
So we can buy this right.

907
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,080
Future on the hit edge.

908
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,080
All right.

909
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
Adam.

910
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,080
Thank you for playing.

911
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,080
Thank you.

912
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
Everyone else.

913
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Thank you for listening.

914
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
So until then, take care.

915
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,080
Have fun.

916
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,080
And try to think with your hearts.

917
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,080
Bye-bye.

918
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,080

Oh, yeah.

00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,080
Thank you very much, John.

924
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,080
Hit test number one hundred and twenty seven.

925
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
Love it as always, my friend.

926
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,080
Back to the fun.

927
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
Save music on the footballer Friday.

928
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,080
Musical Express, freight train addition.

929
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,080
Ugly suit.

930
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,080
Here's your cargo on the Charlie.

931
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,080
I'm going to swing.

932
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,080
You're the rain.

933
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,080
Under me.

934
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,080
Under me.

935
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,080
And I'm going to be the cross.

936
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,080
Get far and hit and meet.

937
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,080
As I stay.

938
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,080
Further on the beach.

939
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,080
I'm going to stay.

940
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,080
And you won.

941
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,080
Under me.

942
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,080
And you won.

943
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,080
Under me.

944
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
And you won.

945
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
Under me.

946
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
Under me.

947
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
Under me.

948
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,080
And you won.

949
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,080
Don't forget.

950
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
Don't rest.

951
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,080
Don't need at all.

952
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,080
Save it all.

953
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,080
Be far.

954
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Come on.

955
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,080
Come on.

956
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,080
Come.

957
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Come on.

958
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,080
Come.

959
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,080
Come.

960
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,080
I took it to the shi-kalu

961
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,080
I took it to the shi-kalu

962
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,080
The temperature struck till I was not in the city

963
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:47,080
And I can hardly feel my blood

964
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:56,080
But just as I had almost lost my mind completely

965
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,080
The face had shown the songs in my blood

966
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,080
But without the words of many dead

967
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:13,080
The sound of whey so many whey

968
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,080
The sound of whey told me

969
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,080
And whewed it all in the game

970
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:29,080
To just go to the art of the art of the art of the art of the art

971
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,080
The sound of whey so many whey so many whey

972
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,080
The sound of whey so many whey so many whey

973
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,080
The sound of whey food

974
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,080
And whey so many whey so many whey

975
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,080
The sound of whey so many whey so many whey

976
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,080
The sound of whey so many whey so many whey

977
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:19,080
And whey so many whey so many whey

978
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,080
So many whey so many whey so many whey

979
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,080
And whew so many whey so many whey so many whey

980
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,080
The sound of whey so many whey so many whey so many whey

981
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
The sound of whey so many whey so many whey so many whey so Many whey so many whomey

982
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:35,080
And I'm pretty, that's another one for them.

983
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,080
That is from the Potset music network.

984
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,080
The ugly suit.

985
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,080
I kind of drifted towards the page with that name popped up.

986
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
Yeah.

987
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,080
That's got to be something.

988
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,080
I'm just looking, I got a new sponsor here on the Charlie.

989
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,080
The Friday is brought to you by no one less than budget rent to car.

990
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,080
Check that out.

991
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
And I got an offer for you guys.

992
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Hold on a second.

993
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:06,080
So if you're renting a car, this of course only counts for the United States.

994
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,080
If you're planning a renting a car, maybe for the Fourth of July week,

995
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,080
or maybe for the weekend, but particularly a week,

996
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,080
which a lot of people do these days.

997
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,080
And quite honestly, I use our car so infrequently now,

998
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,080
I'd almost consider renting a car.

999
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,080
It's entirely practical because the tree, when I need the car,

1000
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,080
it's really not going very far.

1001
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,080
But I would definitely consider giving it up,

1002
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,080
particularly at today's gas prices.

1003
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Anyway, here's the offer for the chuckleheads.

1004
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,080
If you're going to rent a car anyway, go check out budget.

1005
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Because of course, let me see, what do we have here?

1006
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,080
But they got a whole bunch of, it's like 900 locations in the US.

1007
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,080
I guess pretty much everybody now is offering GPS.

1008
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,080
But they are also offering GPS navigation.

1009
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
They've added to any rental.

1010
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,080
And of course, they've got all the latest Ford vehicles.

1011
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,080
And more, including a hummer.

1012
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,080
You can rent a hummer from budget.

1013
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,080
Is that a contradiction in terms?

1014
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
I love that.

1015
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
I guess that's true.

1016
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,080
I used to, when we were in, when I still had MTV,

1017
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,080
and we go to California, the Los Angeles to do stuff.

1018
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,080
And like for the MTV Video Music Awards,

1019
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,080
when they were held in LA, you could go to budget luxury rental

1020
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,080
on a sunset, I think it was.

1021
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,080
I always thought it was so funny because like budget, but they had all the top end cars.

1022
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,080
And you know, like a Mercedes 500 SL or something.

1023
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,080
Back in the day when budgets were a plenty.

1024
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:31,080
So anyway, you can rent a Hummer H3, a Cadillac CTS.

1025
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:36,080
Even if you want a Prius, awesome.

1026
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,080
Okay, so here's the deal.

1027
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,080
You can get, if you use the, if you go to website now,

1028
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,080
you can get a coupon.

1029
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,080
And you've got to go to budget.com slash DSC.

1030
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:50,080
You get $30 off weekly rentals or 10% off any other time period.

1031
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,080
So it's a guaranteed 10% off any car you rented budget.

1032
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,080
And if you take one of their weekly rentals,

1033
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:02,080
it's $30 off budget.com slash DSC.

1034
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,080
All right, some news came in yesterday,

1035
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,080
which I find highly interesting.

1036
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,080
You've probably heard about this.

1037
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,080
A Barack Obama has decided not to make use of the public funds

1038
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,080
for his presidential campaign, which, of course,

1039
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,080
he still has to be officially chosen as the Democratic candidate.

1040
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,080
But let's presume that he's pretty much there.

1041
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,080
No reason to pursue him out to pursue him otherwise.

1042
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,080
He's decided not to go with, and of course,

1043
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,080
this is where all this campaign finance reform.

1044
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,080
All this talk has been about this.

1045
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,080
I think it's $84 million that you can have direct access

1046
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,080
to for your presidential campaign.

1047
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,080
If you're, if you're the candidate,

1048
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,080
I wonder if that's for, for independence as well.

1049
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,080
But anyway, he's declined that.

1050
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,080
And he says, no, I don't want to use public money at all.

1051
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,080
I'm going to use other forms, which, of course,

1052
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,080
is, you know, that can come from a lot of different places.

1053
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,080
And I'm, I'm definitely going to look into that.

1054
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,080
But I think there's this whole concept of bundling,

1055
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,080
sort of one person can collect money from thousands of other people.

1056
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,080
And there are some limits here and there,

1057
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,080
but still he, the bottom line.

1058
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,080
And this was what was interesting.

1059
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,080
He said, $84 million is jotted not just not enough

1060
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,080
to run a presidential campaign.

1061
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,080
And this is what I've always been saying.

1062
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,080
It's like he was the most money generally wins.

1063
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,080
You know, there's Barack Obama basically saying

1064
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,080
it's not enough money to run a presidential campaign.

1065
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,080
Not to compete, you know, not to win.

1066
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,080
It's not even enough to run one.

1067
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Which is just sad.

1068
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,080
It's a sad state of affairs.

1069
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,080
If that's really true.

1070
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,080
But I guess we, I guess we obviously do choose our presidents

1071
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,080
the way we choose our, are so powder.

1072
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,080
Anyway, so back in the early 80s,

1073
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,080
when the thought of a black president of the United States

1074
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,080
was just a wish and many and I,

1075
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,080
is that the correct expression?

1076
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,080
Well, doesn't matter.

1077
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,080
I mean, it was, I have to say it was probably that time

1078
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,080
unimaginable now.

1079
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,080
I was living in Amsterdam with a very different cultural situation.

1080
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,080
And this was the early days.

1081
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,080
Remember sugar hill gang and Curtis blow.

1082
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,080
And it was the very first hip hop slash rap records

1083
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
and blow fly.

1084
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,080
It was kind of like a novelty rap artist at the time.

1085
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,080
And he came out with something called

1086
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,080
first black president.

1087
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,080
And I thought it would be fine to listen to it again

1088
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
on today's football or Friday.

1089
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,080
Just a kind of compare.

1090
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,080
If you could even make a song like this today,

1091
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,080
I don't you could with all the political correctness.

1092
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,080
And obviously, it's humoristic.

1093
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,080
It's ironic.

1094
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,080
And I think it's hilarious.

1095
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,080
But it's really interesting to see how we've changed

1096
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,080
culturally and are thinking in 130 years time.

1097
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,080
Here is blow fly.

1098
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
The first black president.

1099
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,080
From around, I think 1981 or 82.

1100
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,080
Ladies and gentlemen, introduce in the first Nick.

1101
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,080
I'm in the first black president of the United States of America.

1102
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
Present blow fly.

1103
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
Thank you.

1104
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,080
Thank you very much.

1105
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,080
And like I promised y'all when I was running.

1106
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,080
I'm going to make sure they are chillins and every pot.

1107
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,080
And hooks and every table.

1108
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
Black control peels and every purse.

1109
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,080
And we're going to have a orange and every motherfucking weekend.

1110
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,080
Thank you.

1111
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,080
Good morning, Mr. President Sir.

1112
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,080
Good morning, bit.

1113
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
I'm at Ms. Clayton.

1114
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
This shit's going to be easy.

1115
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,080
President don't do nothing but sit on his ass all day.

1116
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,080
And your ball doesn't even mother fucking way.

1117
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,080
It's like getting my hair together here.

1118
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,080
Where's my fucking cocaine?

1119
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,080
But the bitch doesn't move it again.

1120
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
Ms. Clayton.

1121
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
Mr. President Sir?

1122
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,080
You get your ass in here, please.

1123
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,080
That way, sir.

1124
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
What did you do in my ship?

1125
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
Are you constantly at Sir?

1126
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,080
Mitch, you know what I'm talking about, my motherfucking Ronald.

1127
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,080
How?

1128
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,080
I took you down to the vet sir.

1129
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,080
Oh, I'm talking about coke, cocaine.

1130
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,080
You know that white part of shit that I put on your pussy when I'm getting ready to eat it?

1131
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
Oh, that's her.

1132
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
It's right in front of you sir.

1133
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,080
Thank you. That'll be all.

1134
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,080
Stupid bitch.

1135
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,080
If I put it when so good I'll fire.

1136
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,080
Let's get over here and get my hair together.

1137
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,080
And some good shit.

1138
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,080
Mr. President Sir?

1139
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
Shit.

1140
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,080
What the fuck you want now?

1141
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,080
Mr. Jackson is here to see you.

1142
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,080
Mr. Jackson.

1143
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,080
Reggie Jackson and Andrew Jackson are Michael Jackson.

1144
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,080
What, which one?

1145
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,080
Mr. Superfly Jackson.

1146
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,080
Are the United Pimps Association?

1147
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
Shit. What the fuck you want?

1148
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,080
He wants the money you promised him for endorsing you.

1149
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,080
I told that dumb motherfucking old assholes that Congress got all the funds frozen.

1150
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
What the fuck you want from my life?

1151
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,080
Well, he stated that payment and coke would be sufficient.

1152
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,080
My last coke.

1153
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,080
I'll take it. Give it to the motherfucking get rid of me.

1154
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Just in and out shit.

1155
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
I thought that shit was going to be easy.

1156
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,080
I got it. I got some weed here somewhere.

1157
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,080
Here it is.

1158
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,080
I wrote in a couple of jokes.

1159
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,080
Mr. President Sir?

1160
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
Shit.

1161
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,080
What you want now, Mr. Clay?

1162
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,080
Mr. Paul is here to see you, sir.

1163
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,080
Mr. Paul.

1164
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,080
Paul Newman, Paul Reveal.

1165
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,080
Paul Lanker.

1166
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,080
Paul John Paul, sir.

1167
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,080
John Paul?

1168
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,080
What do you want?

1169
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,080
And we each are currently smoking, sir.

1170
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,080
Shit, dude.

1171
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,080
I can see right now I'm not going to like this motherfucking shit at all.

1172
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,080
Give it to the motherfucking.

1173
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,080
Can't sniff no coke.

1174
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,080
Can't smoke no dope.

1175
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,080
Pam, I know what I do.

1176
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,080
Fuck this bitch again.

1177
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,080
Mr. Clay, what are you coming here, please?

1178
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,080
Nightly sir.

1179
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,080
Come on over here, leaving, put off your clothes, which is fine, sir.

1180
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,080
I'm down.

1181
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,080
I don't want to hit a shit this morning.

1182
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,080
Can't smoke no dope.

1183
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,080
Can't smoke no dope.

1184
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:54,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1185
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,080
What is the red spots when you're stumbling?

1186
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,080
That's what I was trying to tell you, sir.

1187
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,080
What are you?

1188
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
I'm safe.

1189
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,080
I went to the doctor, and he says I have hurt me.

1190
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,080
The hot piece?

1191
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,080
I resigned.

1192
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,080
Fucking hungry.

1193
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,080
Oh man, blow fly the first black press.

1194
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,080
And I probably should point out in case you hadn't guessed blow fly as black.

1195
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:23,080
So, again, the irony, the humor, the unthinkable, and it just may happen.

1196
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,080
How about death apples?

1197
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,080
What a great country.

1198
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:30,080
This is your source code, the footballer Friday 7-7-1.

1199
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:36,080
We remember the ones that fall in time.

1200
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:43,080
When you were a man, just also fall for the right and new.

1201
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:51,080
I pulled them down for you just when I barely open.

1202
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:58,080
We said that all good things must stay.

1203
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,080
Even.

1204
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:04,080
Let's just blow away it is when the red.

1205
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,080
Oh, even.

1206
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:15,080
Let's just blow away it is when the red.

1207
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:21,080
The more heavy the soul looks in.

1208
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,080
So open.

1209
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:29,080
Did I should have my chance and the rules?

1210
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:34,080
Feel like I've been used to, will you?

1211
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:43,080
When other night will you spell it out in black and white?

1212
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,080
Even.

1213
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:50,080
Let's just blow away it is when the red.

1214
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:54,080
Oh, even.

1215
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:01,080
Let's just blow away it is when the red.

1216
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:20,080
Let's just blow away it is when the red.

1217
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,080
Oh, even.

1218
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:28,080
Let's just blow away it is when the red.

1219
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,080
Oh, even.

1220
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,080
Let's just blow away it is when the red.

1221
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,080
Oh, even.

1222
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,080
Let's just blow away it is when the red.

1223
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:55,080
Let's just blow away it is when the red.

1224
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,080
Oh, even.

1225
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,080
Let's just blow away it is when the red.

1226
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:09,080
That's just the way it is, baby

1227
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:17,080
Baby, that's just the way it is, baby

1228
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,080
That's just the way it is, baby

1229
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,080
That's just the way it is, baby

1230
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:39,080
I know about you, but it just lets know this music and all this creativity that's blasting out through the ethernits

1231
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,080
It really makes me think, you know, maybe it's just the way it is, baby

1232
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:53,080
It's the Rembrandt's, not pot-sake, but the hell man, it's a full bar Friday, we gotta do something

1233
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,080
That's just the way it is, baby

1234
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,080
It's Friday

1235
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:08,080
Now I do have one more song to go for it, but I was just thinking about, you know, what if

1236
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:15,080
You know, what if it really is true that there's a whole bunch of elites that are sitting kind of in their evil rooms

1237
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:20,080
stroking their white pussycats, you know, you know, the guys that go moo ha ha

1238
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:26,080
And they really aren't just trying to control us, what if all of this stuff like the price of oil, you know?

1239
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:35,080
What if that's being jacked up, just to put the squeeze on us, because you know when people are depressed and afraid and, you know, look at inflation

1240
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:41,080
It's going up, you know, we've got troubling times ahead, we're perhaps on the brink of a recession

1241
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:47,080
If not depression, certainly some inflation and stagnation

1242
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:55,080
What if it's all part of the plan, you know, part of the idea is just to to wear us down to squashes

1243
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:01,080
It could actually be hamping, and of course, the more we start yelling and the more we start freaking out about stuff

1244
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:08,080
The more we're ground down into oblivion, what if we should really just, I don't know, you should think about this over the weekend

1245
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,080
Or if you're not Australia, of course, you're listening to this on next Tuesday, so

1246
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:19,080
What if we should play a little bit more cool, you know, maybe maybe we shouldn't be protesting

1247
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,080
Maybe we need to seek other courses of action, maybe

1248
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:32,080
Well, somewhere there's a combination, I'm thinking the power that Ireland showed, show the euro crats, the political elite and in Brussels

1249
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,080
Maybe that power, you know, by saying, hey, you know what, we're just not going to let you guys do what you want to do

1250
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:44,080
Because at the end of the day, you gotta go through us first and thank God there was still one country, one member state

1251
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:50,080
It was able to stop the lunacy that is the Lisbon treaty because no one understands what it means

1252
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,080
Maybe that's our power

1253
00:48:53,080 --> 00:49:00,080
We need to investigate a lot more about this because of course there are 26 other states in the European Union that

1254
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:06,080
Just got the Lisbon treaty rammed down their throat, and how do we apply this to the United States?

1255
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,080
How can we actually stop things as citizens?

1256
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:13,080
Is there a referendum law in the US that we can utilize on certain issues?

1257
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:19,080
Maybe there's something there, maybe we just gotta kick back, not get to work up about all this shit that they're trying to throw at

1258
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,080
It's trying to make us down, break us down, stomp us to the ground

1259
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,080
That my friends is my final thought for the week

1260
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:38,080
Now of course I'm not going to let you go on just that thought we've got to crank up the party a little bit

1261
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,080
You know what I mean?

1262
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:43,080
Kick back everybody and let's just enjoy the highlights

1263
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:49,080
Light it up, put it in the air

1264
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,080
Light it up, light it up

1265
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,080
Can't help but hurt

1266
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:09,080
Can't piss, put a blade, hash, plant, toss, stick, white with a wet the train

1267
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:13,080
It no, I'll do it to the brain, orange, brown, red, head, green

1268
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,080
Poach, clown, bones, bloods, zig, zags

1269
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,080
Bubbles, bones, blown out of big packs, twist up, roll up, pack up

1270
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,080
Hit that sense so strong in the air, where you get that

1271
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,080
Can't pack a stand, lamb, sprit, scum

1272
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,080
I can't poke, blow, leave, hide, roll, fall

1273
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,080
Blue bear, we're finally chocolate, chum

1274
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:32,080
Northern life's bloodless cannabis cut

1275
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,080
You know what I mean?

1276
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1277
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1278
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:47,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1279
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:51,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1280
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I know there's no light

You just go

All right, I'm going to leave y'all not know my friends, RJ-D2, hi-lites.

1298
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:42,600
I think that's another one I got on the source code drop, which is just a treasure trove information.

1299
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,600
I really appreciate everything you guys are dropping in there.

1300
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,600
It's Drop.io slash daily source code.

1301
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,600
All right, I'm definitely showing out over the weekend.

1302
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:57,600
Big game for Holland playing against Russia, which of course is coached by the former Dutch national coach.

1303
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,600
Hitting.

1304
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,600
So that's going to be a fantastic game.

1305
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,600
We're just on fire here in Europe.

1306
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,600
Forget all this Lisbon Treaty stuff.

1307
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,600
Boy, we love playing football against each other.

1308
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,600
And I have to say it's really been very friendly.

1309
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,600
There's been no animosity.

1310
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,600
It's just been good.

1311
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,600
It's been honest fun.

1312
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,600
And it's fantastic to be a part of Europe this time.

1313
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,600
Certainly this point in my life.

1314
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,600
And let's see if we can, hey, you know what?

1315
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,600
Fuck it.

1316
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,600
Let's use our power.

1317
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,600
Go save the world.

1318
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,600
Until we speak again, my friends have yourselves a great weekend.

Please live your life with passion and as long as it lasts.

1320

Enjoy your freedom.

1321
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,600
Another fine, medium presentation.

1322
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,600
Stick it in your ear.
