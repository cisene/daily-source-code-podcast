00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
What better way to start your day than with a hot cup of coffee, the financial times,

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,720
a little DSC-810.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,520
Well, you might want to go to the bathroom first.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,160
Here's Adam Curry and the Daily Source.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,240
The $16 billion worth of airplanes wrapped to my ass.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,320
The next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,320
We don't need not sticky in trees, man

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,320
I like to think I'm sighing into this shirt

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,320
Fantastic, it's a battle curry

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,320
Bibi Bumble in the stingers, Mumble who've already killed singers

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
Lonnie, Mac, Twang, and Eddie, he's been ring with Go and Steady

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,320
Take it easy, take me high, lie, lie, lie, lie

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,320
So far, no commotion, Boko patch, a deeper purple set

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,320
As fashion, baby, baby, gotta gotta give me give me getin' high

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,320
The same is cooking less the girl, richy balance in the story

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,320
My face, the Fuji, I'm a camera, suit your romma, lumber, richy berries

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,320
Back to Barry, white, just don't just dance and Harry

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,320
She means she me, me, Goko, puppet fence, back to Goko on the climb

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,320
And say, wow, but the baby, oh, hold me

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,320
Gotta turn it up loud, oh, oh, oh

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,320
So my ticket, oh, leave me

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,320
Roo, who lies, is it love, under ready-o-side?

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,320
I'm eating love, I'm eating love, I'm eating love

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,320
Guys, I'm cold, can't hold me

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,320
If a meme hits a clicking one of the boys,

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,320
Pockets a gift, raise a room and say, if you keep renderin'

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,320
Then tabulate your college, I'm in the air, hold the rose,

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,320
Hold the rose, hold it, hold the daddy, catchin' down in the river

29
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Just catchin' now, I got the shivers, mungajiri, payin' for you

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,320
Bowin' while I'm merry, merry, knackin' down in the night

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,320
Trapped with guards, they inject the river, got it, goes to catch

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
What a lame, what's the gimme, shin' the miracles

33
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,320
And tell people, it's like a toss of tender bass and mushroom

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,320
I'm livin' the money, brown, that was a pick at town, kick it high

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,320
This ain't rock, but the radio's high

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,320
This ain't rock, but the radio's woo!

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:24,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:48,420
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, unless there's no one else but there's a never a

39
00:02:48,420 --> 00:03:18,420
They say rock, but they're ready, oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

40
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:48,420
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey you, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

41
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:54,420
December 2008, getting ready to close out the year. And I'm ready for some changes in the new year.

42
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:02,100
A lot of things going on. The big move, of course, is what's top of mind. As we have the key,

43
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:09,220
we're in, well, we're still living in the manner. We have the, and by the way, final,

44
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:15,460
it's curry terrace. It just, it just sounds good. I like it. Curry court, curry square, etc.

45
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:21,460
Now, curry terrace, I like the ring to it. No illiteration. We're doing good. It's going to be

46
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,740
fantastic. And not just the fact that it's, that it's a great house, that the location is

47
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,940
surprisingly fantastic. It's just so typical of the lady Patricia. She'll find a place

48
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:39,380
now it's in Southwest London. And when we tell people, you know, SW4, they're like, huh?

49
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:46,180
Which is, it's really only right behind Chelsea when you think about it. Maybe a 10 minute cab right

50
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:52,420
away. But we don't want to live in Chelsea. We don't, there's a lot of places we don't want to live.

51
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:58,820
But, you know, we like some that has cultures, something that has the art, something that has,

52
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,900
let's just call it, quote, normal people instead of Russian billionaires. And I think we've

53
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,820
really found it. And I'm very, very excited about it. The house is just, it's going to be great

54
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,580
for a number of reasons. One of the big pluses, of course, is that this thing has a, an apartment

55
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:21,700
out back. So if you, uh, if you go through the, the ground floor, the SW2A, and you're in the kitchen,

56
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:28,420
which is humongous, a great kitchen with an aga, one of those fantastic stoves. You walk right

57
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,220
out the back. There's a little Palazzo. And right there is an apartment to converted garage, garage,

58
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,020
I should say. And that's where we're going to stick the teenager. So that means we get massive

59
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,460
privacy back in our house. Christina has massive privacy. Still nice and closely located to each other.

60
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:49,540
But my office is what I'm most excited about. I have to admit, I get the, uh, the Sutoah,

61
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,860
and the front of the house. So actually, I even have my own door, my own entrance if I want

62
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:01,220
and high ceiling, which means plenty of space for the light racks, which I'm planning on hanging

63
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,540
up. Oh, yeah, I'm going to do it right. I'm going completely minimalistic. I'm building one

64
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,340
19 inch rack of external gear that I just want to have because there are those moments when you need

65
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:17,620
something. So, uh, let's see what will that out. My, uh, TLA 5052 processor. I've got, uh, some dbx,

66
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:24,900
compressor gates. I've got, um, oh, uh, I've got, uh, some more processing gear. I mean, it's maybe

67
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,460
there's like 8 or 9 different boxes that'll just happen one beautiful 19 inch rack. All of the

68
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,100
wiring tucked away. When I've one mixer instead of the four that I have out here on display,

69
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:43,460
I've got a massive honk and quad dual core mega honker Mac G5 with two screens, which is going

70
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,820
to be used for video editing because I have to say, I knew I would really get into it once I started

71
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:54,180
and had a reason to. And I've been doing these media today segments all by myself from spreadsheet

72
00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:00,180
to upload is what I say. It's been a very, very steep climb and the learning curve is still, um,

73
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,260
you know, I can't quite see the horizon yet, but I'm getting there. But I'm very excited because

74
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:10,980
this has given me a lot of experience and a lot of, well, a lot of licensed to mess around and,

75
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:18,500
and, uh, essentially, muck stuff up. But I am getting very close to being ready for a video program

76
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,420
that accompanies the daily source code. But also the daily source code. I want to change it.

77
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:28,020
Someone wrote, maybe it was on the on the drop, which, of course, is a big catalyst behind the

78
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,780
changes that I'd like to make in the show. And which, of course, is what the daily source code has

79
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,300
always been about. It's always been about change and experimenting and trying new things and

80
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,340
you format. Someone wrote somewhere and I can't quite find it anymore that felt a little bit like

81
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,820
I was in a vacuum and you're absolutely right. You know, for years now, we'd be doing

82
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:54,580
voicemails, um, running through different links. And now, of course, with the source code drop,

83
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:01,700
drop.io slash daily source code, there's enough material in here easily to do a show every single

84
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:07,220
day. But I don't, you know, yeah, I can sit here and I can, you know, pick the, the choice articles

85
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,100
for you to read and, uh, I can talk about them and then you respond to them one or two or three days

86
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:17,380
later. And of course, it's been incredibly difficult and just challenging time-wise, um,

87
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,340
because of the amount of production involved. And of course, the longer you wait between shows,

88
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,500
the more there is to look at, the more there is to sift through, the more there is to talk about,

89
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,740
which makes the show is really, really long. I know people aren't hating the longer shows.

90
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,860
But I'm, I'm feeling like I'm in a bit of a rut and I'm, I'm ready for a change and I do want

91
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,580
to talk about that with y'all today. And we're going to be playing lots of music, uh, some really

92
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,220
good comments that came back. The first one, this is pretty funny, uh, not just the comment,

93
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,220
but eight word oh man, you just sound lovely. Listen to this. Joe Adam. Yo, man,

94
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,740
eight word oh, where are we going from Seattle? Yo, long time, Lisa and her first shine

95
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,660
dropper. And I wanted to drop you a message. By the way, that is now official, uh, Charlie

96
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:07,220
vernacular. First time listener, long time dropper. Or no, first time caller, long time dropper.

97
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,020
Just as long as you're dropping, that's good, because during your past show, you keep

98
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:18,500
complaining about hearing the dog and you play around with your noise get and I couldn't tell

99
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,940
the difference. I've been here your dog and I wasn't sure if you're just, uh,

100
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,140
I love the way you say that. Tell the difference. I've been here your dog, man. I didn't hear

101
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:34,900
your fucking dog. And I wasn't sure if you're just going crazy. I killed the dog or the job

102
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:43,540
was processed. You're obvious. Oh, no. Here that dog barking. Anyways, just curious. Love the hair.

103
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:50,020
Eduardo, I need you to send me some jingles and shit, man. I love your voice. I love the accent.

104
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:55,220
You know, come up with some stuff and email it to me. Please, I love it. I couldn't hear your

105
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,100
dog. You know what? It's interesting, because I was convinced that I go to hit, you know,

106
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,500
I'm hearing the dog. I got my headphones on. He's not barking loud enough for me to hear it.

107
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,500
Through the headphones, but not through the microphone. So I don't know. But no, there's never any post

108
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,660
processing going on. Everything is done live to disc as it were. But Eduardo, you are officially

109
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,500
hired, man. Please send me some more stuff. I just love the way that sounds.

110
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:43,540
I don't agree. Well, I'm sure that Jesus was a hell of a man. If he was in the city,

111
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:49,380
don't understand. The whole thing sucks. It's all about books. If you ain't got him,

112
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:55,780
you're at a lot. A nice little Christmas getting from the super suckers.

113
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,660
The city coming up to a bunch of ways. Not about the change in the weather. I don't think she would say

114
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:07,620
like to get here. But we're not sick. You don't totally throw back in the bathroom. Come on, we're here.

115
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,620
Yeah, yeah, something to do. Yeah, something to do. Yeah, something to do. Yeah, something to do.

116
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:23,620
Yeah, something to do.

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:29,620
Yeah, something to do. Yeah, something to do. Yeah, something to do.

Yeah, something to do. Yeah, something to do. Yeah, something to do. Yeah, something to do. Yeah, something to do.

120
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:52,860
Yeah, something to do. Yeah, something to do. Yeah, something to do.

121
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:41,620
What they tell, why don't change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change,

why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, they said, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why not, they change, why don't they change, what don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they changed, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, it they change, why don't they change, why don't they change, why don't they change,

123
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:39,940
Super suckers, call it Christmas time, the first of what I'm sure will be many, many alternative

124
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:46,180
Christmas songs, this holiday season on the Chuck, by the way, big move date is December 29th

125
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,780
and 30th.

126
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,660
So who knows what I'm going to be doing over the Christmas holidays?

127
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,620
Packin' up, I guess, is what I'm doing.

128
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,500
So just to reiterate, I'm going minimalistic, I can already see it for me, I've got my big,

129
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:06,020
nice long desk table, I've got nothing but two monitors right in front of me, keyboard,

130
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:11,420
wireless mouse, then off to the left is where I want to have a station for my laptop, which

131
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,660
is where I do all my, my source code production on.

132
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,060
That will have its own monitor and only the two MIDI control surfaces I've been harping

133
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,780
about, for ever since I set up this new system, which of course is the Fader Fox.

134
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,500
So a little mini mixer fader, which really isn't the audio mixer, it's just a MIDI control

135
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,300
surface, and then the Mega Button array.

136
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,300
What is this?

137
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:39,460
Microsoft's Micro Module LX2, Lima X-ray 2, and that'll be it, and then the 19-inch

138
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,580
rack and everything else, I'm getting rid of, I'm, I'm trying to give it away, throw it

139
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:50,460
away, throw it out, we have to clean out, we already did our big storage clean out,

140
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,500
and boy, that was actually quite wonderful, a good rid of a lot of crap.

141
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,620
And so here come the new year's resolutions, I've already said that at least the stuff

142
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,140
I will talk about with you guys, I got plenty of things, I'm still flushing out, there's

143
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,700
a lot of improvements I'd like to make in life.

144
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,340
So I want to continue, obviously I'll be continuing these MVO today segments, I want to

145
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:19,460
get better at that, learn more about the editing process, it's funny, I'm, you know,

146
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,180
that have been doing this now for a couple of weeks, which means I've put in probably

147
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:28,020
over 100 hours now, a video editing time and messing around and understanding how to make

148
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,220
things faster, how to work faster, how to work more creatively, and now I'm watching

149
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,460
television, I'm seeing all these, these effects and stuff, like, oh, okay, I know how they did

150
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,460
that.

151
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,860
Oh, of course, they, they didn't make that choice, it's really kind of, I'm reborn here,

152
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,140
rebirthing process into video.

153
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:51,460
So that means I'm going to make my, my gear show, I'll talk to, um, MVO UK, mega producer

154
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,420
Rob Dolly about putting some together, so he's, he's working with me on that, and then

155
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,300
there's the, they work for us show, which I think could easily be a daily program, it

156
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,900
may not be actually on camera, but it has to be video, I want to show your government,

157
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,980
your officials worldwide, and the calamities they're involved in.

158
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,180
I mean, I'm just looking at the, uh, the front page of the financial times for today with

159
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:21,940
the mega mini reptilian, uh, what's the guy's name, Rod, Blod Jovich, I think that's

160
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,860
a pronounce it.

161
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:32,380
Blod, Blod, Blod Jovich, Blod Jovich, okay, he's the governor of Illinois.

162
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,940
He's the guy, if you have, and this is all over the mainstream news, so I'm, I'm hope

163
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,540
you've heard a bit Patricia heard about, and she was laughing, uh, because she's, uh, she's

164
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,180
seeing, she's not asleep.

165
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,180
I'll tell you that.

166
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,380
She doesn't want to wake up.

167
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,780
She likes living in her own little Patricia dream world, which is fine, but she's not

168
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,780
asleep.

169
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,340
So this guy is the governor.

170
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:56,580
He is the one who determines what happens with the present elect Barack Obama's Illinois

171
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,220
Senate seat.

172
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:06,020
That is an appointment by, um, that will be an appointment by the governor of Illinois.

173
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:11,660
And he essentially was, uh, right on the front page of the financial times here, uh,

174
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:17,100
a quote, of course, it's, uh, it's starred out for your protection, because we don't really

175
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,860
want you to know what words we're used, but here's the quote, not safe work.

176
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,340
I've got this thing that would be the Senate seat.

177
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,620
It's fucking golden, and I, uh, I'm not just giving it up for fucking nothing.

178
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,620
That's right.

179
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,940
He wanted ambassador ship.

180
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,380
He wanted some kind of, um, you know, all, all different kinds of perks and thoughts.

181
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,340
And he just, it was using it to make some money from self.

182
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,100
And this is not just one bad dude.

183
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,580
This is the entire system.

184
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,580
This is the system.

185
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:49,500
Because it's certainly the Chicago system, your future president comes out of full of corruption.

186
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,620
This is just the tip of the iceberg, and you know it don't hide from it.

187
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,620
And it's in mainstream news, but of course, you know, it'll get glossed over.

188
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,100
I'm sure we'll have, but is Amy Winehouse still in the hospital that'll probably take

189
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
the headlines today.

190
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,220
So anyway, so I'd love to do kind of a headline show.

191
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,860
I'm sure it can be effective in video and I'm looking forward to producing that, but the

192
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:15,620
core of my existence, not just professionally, but personally and well as well is the daily

193
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,620
source code.

194
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,340
Is the relationship that I have with you guys with the charcoal heads out there?

195
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:26,980
As it congeels and comes together on the source code drop, there is so much happening.

196
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,020
These are fantastic times to be talking about the world in general.

197
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,300
People are interested.

198
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,780
They're just being snowed under and hypnotized by mainstream media.

199
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,020
So here's the thinking that I have for this show and where I'd like to take it.

200
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,940
I would like to commit a minimum of an hour, five days a week.

201
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,740
And I'd like, we've talked about this many times, but I think it's time to really try it.

202
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,860
I'd just like to start, let's say, and I thought about the time as well.

203
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:01,860
If I started at three o'clock in the afternoon, UK time, I pretty much, there's a, everyone

204
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:08,100
has a possibility to, to check it out live because you'll either be, let's see, San

205
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,740
Francisco time would be seven a.m.

206
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,780
So you could actually listen to some of it at home.

207
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,940
If you're on your way to work, well, you're screwed.

208
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,540
But of course, you live on the West Coast.

209
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,380
You're a half, you're a whole day behind the world anyway.

210
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,620
New York would be much better.

211
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,940
You would be at work.

212
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,220
The United Kingdom would be after your lunch break.

213
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,220
Australia.

214
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,100
Shit, it's the weekend already.

215
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,540
Well, when it's three o'clock on Wednesday, here in the UK.

216
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,380
But I really want to do it the right way.

217
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,660
And here's a technical challenge, because this is what I'm racking my brain about.

218
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,220
Now, you know, I've got Skype hooked in and I've got the mix minus signal all set up so

219
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,980
that there's no echo when you're talking to me and that stuff works perfectly.

220
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:57,380
But I really need to be able to manage the call so that I can stack up two or three calls,

221
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,580
and I want to talk to people that'll be about what's going on in the drop.

222
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,540
It's what's going on in the world.

223
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,140
But I have to pre-screen.

224
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,420
And not like if I want, you know, the screening sounds wrong.

225
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,860
But I need to know what you're going to talk about.

226
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,980
I need to know what the topic is.

227
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:16,700
I got to set you up because otherwise it just becomes not fun to listen to if someone,

228
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,900
you know, just doesn't sound right on the air.

229
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,740
Can't talk, you know, we can't get the message across.

230
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,140
That doesn't happen all that often, by the way.

231
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,180
But you know, I just need to know.

232
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,020
Okay, we got Bob and he's got this to say, we got Russ, he's got that to say.

233
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,020
And gee, we might even have some women calling in when that be novel.

234
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:39,740
And of course, the whole thing would be saved as a show and would be in the feed is normal.

235
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,660
And you know, and I have a little better chance to really do something topical daily.

236
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,980
Because we need to, you know, I can know, I can no longer wait a day to talk about something

237
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,860
because then there's five other things that pile on top of it.

238
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,420
I'll just run down what what I've got for today.

239
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,100
And this is all, we're most of it is taken from the draw.

240
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:12,860
Actually, let me see, I say actually, but I, what I'm saying is I don't know where to start.

241
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,580
That's what I'm saying.

242
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:21,620
Okay, judicial watch announced its Hillary Clinton constitutionally ineligible to serve as Secretary

243
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,460
of State.

244
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,660
Well, that's an interesting one.

245
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,180
Although probably right in article one section six of the U.S. Constitution, it says,

246
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,740
no Senator or representative shall during the time for which he was elected be appointed

247
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,540
to any civil office under the authority of the United States, which he'll have been created

248
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,820
or emulments where of shall have been increased during such time.

249
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:52,140
So they actually all voted for a raise for themselves, which means technically Hillary

250
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,500
Clinton would not be eligible.

251
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,700
I'm sure a lot of people would like to weigh in on that one.

252
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:01,100
If we had to open phone lines, the World Health Organization, this link is directly

253
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:08,980
to the WHO website, Geneva, international experts have established a tolerable daily intake

254
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,340
better known as a TDI for melamine.

255
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,220
The chemical found recently incontaminated milk products.

256
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,980
So instead of saying, hey, stop this chemical should not be in our milk and it could be

257
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,140
killing people, including our children.

258
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:29,260
We'll just come up with an acceptable intake level, the TDI, we even give it a little

259
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,260
acronym there.

260
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,580
Hey, man, your TDI is no problem there for your melamine for the poison we've gotten

261
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,580
your food.

262
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,140
I mean, do you think we could talk about that?

263
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,220
I'm sure some of you would want to say that.

264
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,860
Now, the link here, melamine is just the tip of the iceberg.

265
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,820
This comes from natural news, putting it in the show notes.

266
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,500
All of these, of course, are in the show notes at dailysourceco.com, crossposted at curry.com

267
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,700
because you've got to read what is going on.

268
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,140
It will just blow you away.

269
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,140
Financial times is doing such a fantastic job.

270
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,540
And there, what are the, oops, what that was?

271
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,780
Well, they, uh, I love their little byline, their, their mission statement, home on

272
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,780
where is it?

273
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,780
I hear it is.

274
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,900
Financial times without fear and without favor.

275
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,900
Yeah.

276
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,140
And I think they actually get away with that.

277
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:27,580
Gideon Rackman is a, uh, I guess he's a columnist for the financial times.

278
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,140
He wrote, uh, he didn't saw Johnson Devorick post this on Devorick.org.org.

279
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,180
He wrote a fantastic article titled, and now for a world government.

280
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:41,020
Now remember, this is not cookie add um, this is not wacky websites.

281
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:46,700
This is the financial effing times writing about, well, actually, it's, I'll read a little

282
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,420
bit of it as as Gideon Rackman starts off.

283
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,860
I have never believed that there is a secret United Nations plot to take over the US.

284
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,780
I have never seen black helicopters hovering in the sky above Montana, but for the first

285
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,420
time in my life, I think the formation of some sort of world government is plausible.

286
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,340
That's how that article starts off.

287
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,260
Of course, is what we've been talking about for quite some time.

288
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,900
And it's starting to dawn on people, which is good.

289
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,060
But man, you know, when people say, why do they want that?

290
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:19,500
Well, you know, has this, is this the European Union thing?

291
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,220
No, no, this has been going on for eons.

292
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,660
This is what it's always been about.

293
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:29,020
But now we finally have the opportunity through the internet to communicate with each other,

294
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,780
to actually share these ideas and studies are now proving that people are starting to

295
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:38,700
believe news from the internet more often than they believe mainstream media news.

296
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,820
This is all good.

297
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,020
This is positive.

298
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,260
This is why I want to go live on a daily basis.

299
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,900
So here's the technical challenge that we have.

300
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,380
I need to have some form of basically a switchboard.

301
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:58,060
I'd like for it to be in software so that, you know, I can, I can take it on my laptop

302
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:02,340
and manage it wherever I go, which means by definition, you're looking at a VoIP system.

303
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,980
I know there's an open source PBX called Asterix.

304
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,580
It would be way too way above my head to set this thing up and configure it and get it

305
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,580
going.

306
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,220
But let me just lay out the technical specs and maybe someone out there can help me.

307
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,900
So I would like to be able to jack into my system.

308
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:27,780
It can be, I would love for it to be hooked in through the core audio of the Mac, which

309
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,660
means it has an input channel and an output channel.

310
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,980
Because then I can control through my own software with able to live.

311
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,700
I can control what I'm sending back down the line.

312
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,700
Okay.

313
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,460
So that you don't get all that echo, et cetera, et cetera.

314
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:49,780
I need to be able to stack up, say at least five calls, put people on hold and then

315
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,980
be able to selectively bring them in, you know, basically switch them onto the show.

316
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,620
And of course, it would be even better if I could conference.

317
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,900
That's what I really want.

318
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,140
And because I want to make it easier, I want people to be able to pick up the phone

319
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,300
and call in.

320
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,700
Skype, it does not work on call in.

321
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,500
I hear people call talk shows on Skype.

322
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:15,380
It sucks, you know, because it just it sucks and that's more, I think, a function of

323
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,300
the headsets people are using, then Skype itself.

324
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,140
So just I want you to be able to pick up the phone, okay?

325
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:28,140
And with the way bandwidth is moving and the way 3G and HSDPA modems are working, you'll

326
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,740
be able to listen to this thing, if it's streamed live, which is another part of the

327
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:37,220
technical equation, I need a really good, and by the way, I'll be happy to take this as

328
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,220
a service.

329
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,340
If this were like a cloud thing out there, boy, with that rock.

330
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,060
So the two things I need, one is a great streaming server.

331
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,260
And I want it to be a service.

332
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,740
I don't want to have to set anything up or configure.

333
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,700
I'm happy to pay for it.

334
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,980
Just so that anyone can listen to this to a live stream and has to be simple for me to

335
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
jack into.

336
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,260
Second one is the phone bridge.

337
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,980
If that were a service, oh, hallelujah, wouldn't that be fantastic?

338
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,940
Something I could really, really use simply because I don't have a producer here.

339
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,940
So the way I would do it is I'd stack up a couple calls before I start.

340
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,940
I get going.

341
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,940
I'd talk to some people.

342
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,940
I'd play a song.

343
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,420
During the song, I could take a few more calls, stack them up.

344
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:22,340
You know, that way we can, you know, really get a conversation going and really get some

345
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:28,780
real-time feedback and really get into helping each other get through the times which

346
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,500
will be more than challenging.

347
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,980
Of course, there are some snags along the way, not just the technical hurdles that I'm

348
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,300
looking at, but let me see.

349
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,100
The new world order actually wants to take down the internet.

350
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,500
I'm sure you've heard about this.

351
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,100
Adam, I always talk to you about the internet watch foundation.

352
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,100
I'm sure you know what it is.

353
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,700
I'm sure you've read that article off.

354
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,140
Yeah, internet watch foundation is what he said.

355
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,980
We're relating to it.

356
00:27:52,980 --> 00:28:01,780
Basically, they are now blocking internet access for people who are on the UK's biggest

357
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,780
ISP.

358
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,780
Yeah, okay.

359
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,260
So if you had not heard about this, this was a big news a couple days ago.

360
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:16,540
The six big UK internet service providers are blocking access to Wikipedia, a mid-child

361
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,300
pornography allegations.

362
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,060
So of course, the fact that they're doing that means that they're super-narsheds.

363
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:30,460
You know, Virgin, what we got plus 02 I believe are doing as well as the probably includes

364
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,180
all 02 hand sets as well.

365
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,420
I'm guessing maybe I can't be sure of that one.

366
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:40,700
But you know, that we're blocking the blocking with PDF articles, which is, you know, probably

367
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,060
the best GPS thing to do ever.

368
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,740
Oh, I agree with those people, and if you don't know what I'm talking about, just Google

369
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:53,220
into our watch foundation, I'm sure you will find out, but basically, child pornography

370
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,580
is a disgusting thing that should be stopped at all costs, however, that does not mean

371
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,380
that you have the right to filter what I can do on the internet.

372
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,560
Oh, of course, the legal repercussions in me actually going to one of these child-porn

373
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,860
websites and you know, download your watch in the material, and best, you know, the police

374
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,860
provides a common number.

375
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,860
I see you for the deal.

376
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,860
I'm trying to stop.

377
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,860
Oh, sorry, I had the mic close there.

378
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,140
So I've got a couple of links here about this story.

379
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,660
Let me just get some headlines for you.

380
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,420
This is from wikynews.org.

381
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,860
Wikynews has learned that at least six of the United Kingdom's main internet service providers

382
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,580
have implemented monitoring and filtering mechanisms that are causing major problems for

383
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:38,060
UK contributors on websites operated by the wiky media foundation.

384
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:42,060
Of course, they don't actually want wikypedia they hate.

385
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:46,740
When I say they, I'm talking about the powers that be, the energy elite, the new world

386
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:53,980
order, the shadow government, because it's an authoritative place where there is no authority.

387
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,940
And by the way, I've gotten burned by it, too, long story.

388
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:03,260
The truth is not really in my profile on wikypedia, but of course, as most would say

389
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,380
where there's smoke, there's fire.

390
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,980
So anyway, so I'm not doing anything about it.

391
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,380
You can think about me whatever you want.

392
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,700
I know the truth, but of course, that completely undermines the power of the powers that

393
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,180
be.

394
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:20,500
The filters appear to be applied because wiky media sites are hosting a scorpion's album cover,

395
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,500
which some call child pornography.

396
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,980
The scorpions are German rock band who have used several controversial album covers and

397
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,380
it perhaps best known for their song, Rocky, like a hurricane.

398
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:36,180
And I think winds of change was probably a bigger hit for them, honestly.

399
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,820
So, you know, this is, you're going to see more and more of this.

400
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,980
And I've warned you about it.

401
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,900
The easiest way to implement laws, yeah, actually, I'm looking at the album cover here,

402
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,460
Virgin Killers, yeah, questionable.

403
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,180
It's a 1976 album cover.

404
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:58,300
It also appears on Amazon.com, many other sites.

405
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,340
Let me see why, do I want to see if I find this offensive?

406
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,340
I don't know.

407
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,740
I think the scorpions in general are kind of offensive.

408
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:14,060
But that doesn't mean that there's not free speech in that this is child pornography.

409
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,900
Very much like the case in, I'm going to say, was this australia?

410
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:24,140
No, what do we got here, or kinds of alarms going off?

411
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,860
Let me see if I can find that link.

412
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:35,500
I from Australia had a picture, and I'm sure I've had this picture on my PC at one point

413
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
or another.

414
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,100
It's like a goof, and you know, a spoof with the simpsons, and then it all screw

415
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,100
with each other.

416
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,620
The guy gets fined.

417
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:47,980
He gets fined for child pornography, because it doesn't matter if the, it doesn't matter

418
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:53,540
if their cartoons are not, if Lisa Simpson is getting boneed, it's considered child pornography

419
00:31:53,620 --> 00:32:00,820
and not satire, humor, or free speech.

420
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,620
You see what we're up against here?

421
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,460
Let me see what else you got on your comment there, my friend.

422
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,900
I'm just not getting the police or the government or, well, in this matter, really, the EU,

423
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,700
I should have said, all right, filter what I can see on the internet, you know, this is

424
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,260
supposed to be a democratic country.

425
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
Yeah, yeah, okay, look.

426
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,260
It's not a democratic country.

427
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,780
Now, all right, certainly not.

428
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:30,740
So funny, look, you know, I've got to learn a whole bunch of new rules and processes

429
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,740
and procedures.

430
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,740
We've been reasonably okay here in the affluent suburb of Surrey hanging out and

431
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,740
Gilford yesterday.

432
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:42,180
Of course, I don't have my parking permit yet, so I had to pay the machine and put

433
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:48,300
a ticket in the window, and I had paid until three PM, I believe, with a new place, you

434
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,820
know, taking deliveries and stuff and setting things up.

435
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:56,020
And as I look at my watch, it's like, oh, shit, it's like 320.

436
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:01,500
And I look out the window, and I see a guy taking a picture of my, of my car.

437
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,940
They always do that now these days to prove that you were actually in violation, they, they

438
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,940
take a digital picture.

439
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:15,220
And I see a truck roll up next to my car, and I'm, you know, oh, man, and I start

440
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:20,900
booking down the street, they were ready to take my car away for 20 minutes overage

441
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,500
on parking.

442
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,140
And they have this, I don't know if you, you know, I've seen many, I've been towed many

443
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,740
times in my life, of course, but I've never seen this device.

444
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:36,580
It's literally like one of those claws at the, at the, at a carnival fairground, you know,

445
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,860
where you can, where it kind of picks up one of those gifts inside, and it shakes a bit,

446
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,460
and it usually drops out of the claw, you never really win a prize.

447
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,460
It's one of those things.

448
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,580
And they just pick your car up and put it on a flat bed and roll it away, and you know,

449
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,620
you're probably not done for three or four hundred pounds at the end of the day, including

450
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,620
the fine.

451
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,580
And so I must say they were very nice.

452
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:02,260
I said, oh, please, you know, I'm moving in, moving house as we say here, please don't

453
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,260
impound my car.

454
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,260
So they let me go on that.

455
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:08,580
It's still got the 60 pound fine, but after 20 minutes, man, those guys don't mess around.

456
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,460
Of course, they have, I've looked at it online.

457
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:17,060
They have 12 cameras surveying the, the slaves, make sure you're not in violation of

458
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,060
any laws you slaves.

459
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,060
Hi.

460
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:30,940
Let me see, okay, I'm, I'm just going to wind up by saying, on the internet watch foundation.

461
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,980
Yes, we definitely need to step up, stand up, and fight against this.

462
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,940
But as long as there's child pornography, claims involved, it's going to be very difficult

463
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:44,260
for anyone to go against this because of the public side guys.

464
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:52,620
And it's just used, um, and viciously used to get laws pushed through for the safety of

465
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,620
the children.

466
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:59,940
And of course, at the end of the day, it's exactly the same people who are not very concerned

467
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,380
about the safety of our children.

468
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,380
Look at the vaccines.

469
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:06,580
They're putting into them, look at the education that they're receiving.

470
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:12,260
Look at the, uh, the availability of, uh, of government sanctioned alcohol, uh, certainly

471
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,700
in the United Kingdom at the government doesn't love you.

472
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,700
They don't love your kids.

473
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,100
They hate you.

474
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,260
So we need to stand up.

475
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,260
We need to do things.

476
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,260
And we need to protect the internet.

477
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,260
It's going to be very hard.

478
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,620
But at the end of the day, the network is the network.

479
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:30,860
And I'm counting on the hundreds of thousands of brilliant systems administrators, engineers

480
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:36,260
and developers who will come up with ways to circumvent any type of BS filtering system

481
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,100
they put in place.

482
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:44,020
We will, it will mean that we'll be severely, um, hampered in how we get our messages out.

483
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:49,140
But we absolutely, as long as there's packets flowing, we'll be able to get something out.

484
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,940
I'm, I'm convinced of it.

485
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:58,540

It helps the network.

company.

514
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:44,620
Whenever you hear a mevio, uh, network show or one of you see a video show using their

515
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,660
codes, you'll know that the producer is actually getting paid by using those code.

Do you like the way we're doing?

520
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:02,060
Here's a guy, uh, actually, uh, he'll, he'll do the introduction himself.

521
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,500
I have not played this song in a long, I don't think I've ever played it on the daily

522
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,500
source code.

523
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
It's always been one of my favorites.

524
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,380
It's a live piece from here it comes, Barry Manalo.

525
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,380
And if you've never heard this, I think it'll bring a smile to your face when you hear

526
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,820
all the fantastic stuff, Mr. Manalo is written throughout the years.

527
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,820
All right.

528
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,660
Now what we're going to do for you here is what we're going to do what we call our VSM.

529
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,900
Now, all right.

530
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,820
Now this VSM, VSM stands for our very strange medley.

531
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,300
And for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about is a medley of, of songs

532
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,420
that you probably know, but I don't think that you know, I had something to do with it.

533
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,260
Okay.

534
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,740
Now, um, when we went out on the road last time, I put it, we had it in the act, you know.

535
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:52,220
And, um, and all my artsy friends came to me, all my artsy, falsy friends came to me.

536
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,300
And I said, Manalo, how could you do such a thing?

537
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,260
How could you put such a piece of garbage in your act?

538
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:02,060
And in a, of course, all my, all my trash, your friends came to me.

539
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,100
And I said, I love that medley that you do.

540
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,380
Hi, guys.

541
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,100
And you're all sitting out here tonight.

542
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,700
And so how could I resist?

543
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,980
So we're going to do our little VSM for you.

544
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:21,300
Now, next time you hear any of this stuff coming at you from your radios and televisions,

545
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,660
you got to think of us, all of us up here on the stage, okay?

546
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,100
And then you can turn all of your radios and televisions into me.

547
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,500
See if you remember this one.

548
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,220
As far as you're in the kitchen, we're on the flip.

549
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,780
We're gonna be the door when I'm down on the wall.

550
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,340
She's out of sight at kids in the way.

551
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:51,180
No time to talk on this picnic day.

552
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:56,180
Come on, come on, come on.

553
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,180
Get up again and take your finger like a kid.

554
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,180
Go, have a battle, come on.

555
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,180
Good bye.

556
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

557
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,180
Say hello to your family.

558
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,180
Come on, everyone.

559
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,180
And can tuck your pride again.

560
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,180
Have a barrel of the war.

561
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,180
Oh, yeah.

562
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,180
How can we forget?

563
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,180
Whenever you're driving,

564
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,180
I'm wherever you're bound.

565
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,180
Like a good neighborhood.

566
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,180
Speak for me, say.

567
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,180
Speak for me, say.

568
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:39,180
Speak for me, say.

569
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,180
I bet.

570
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,180
You're your fate.

571
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,180
Don't let the fire up out.

572
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,180
You're your fate.

573
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,180
Don't let the fire up out.

574
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,180
With your pride and I'm here.

575
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:57,180
To do goodbye?

576
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,180
Contour in us, it's got Spain.

577
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,180
I'm just on鐘, hold me, it's tight.

578
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,180
I'm stuck.

579
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,180
All I'm ready.

580
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,180
Drag me this all these.

581
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,180
I got a bad full moon.

582
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:20,300
I've been in it too, God's been in it

583
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,060
I've been from far,

584
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,900
When the world is closed, I've been there

585
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,900
But don't bring calling me, I've been there

586
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,900
Yeah, I've been there

587
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,300
It's not a call

588
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,500
Call out by the call

589
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,540
Go dream, doctor, ever

590
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,380
Let your memory

591
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:59,060
All in your heart

592
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:07,300
Hmm, it's the most original soft drink ever in the whole

593
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:13,620
Why world, doctor, ever

594
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:20,580
Dr. Pepper, doctor, ever

595
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,780
Dr. Pepper, doctor, ever

596
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,980

Feel free, feel free

00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:38,100
Don't let me be up, feel free, feel free

599
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,420
All close and anxious, it's a pity

600
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:48,740
I'm anxious, feel free, feel free

601
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,340
Feel free, feel free

00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,740
So much light, to be lived

603
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,980
So much light, to be lived

604
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,980
So much reason to try

605
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,980
When you feel it, you'll get

606
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,980
You can't get on too

607
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,980
Oh no, I've been feeling inside

608
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:34,420
Right to the day, so get it on

609
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:42,580
Get it on the way, to make our own

610
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:47,700
So get it on, get it on

611
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,980
To make our own, make our own

612
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:54,980
See it, see it, done it

613
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,980
Oh yeah, come on man, that's just good

614
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,620
That is good, I love that very

615
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,980
Manalo, the very special medley

616
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,980
I don't think that's been recorded anywhere

617
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,460
Other than the live

618
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,660
Situation, the true American art form, the commercial

619
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,420
And when you hear that man

620
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,420
I mean, you know every single one of those songs

621
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,940
If you're from the United States

622
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,260
You're like, oh shit, very Manalo wrote that

623
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,300
Uh-huh

624
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,260
Oh yeah, yeah, all right, let's see

625
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,660
Things not just happen in the European Union

626
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,980
And the United States, but of course in Canada as well

627
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,940
He had him here from Portland

628
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,820
So what's up with this candidate think uh

629
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,420
Suspension of Congress from Harper

630
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,820
By decree of the Queen

631
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,620
Yeah

632
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:59,620
And uh, why is it on Fox News or CNN

633
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,820
Or my local paper the Oregonian?

634
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,820
Dude, it's because no one gives a shit

635
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:08,100
Where it's all about local stuff about the dog and the tree

636
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,460
And uh

637
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,980
Yeah, we'll we'll toss the uh the Illinois governor Senate

638
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,500
Sailtheid and see thing a bone

639
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,700
You know, we'll mention that for a second and then it's right on uh to uh

640
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:22,420
Oh, crack Dan or a child molested or anything to distract you

641
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,420
You know, if it bleeds it leads but

642
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,780
When it comes down to real politics now the world the world really works

643
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,220
That means for me this not interested in giving you that because

644
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,820
You're not interested

645
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,820
You may be my friend

646
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,140
But most people are not

647
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,980
It's changing slowly

648
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,220
You've got to do your part to wake people up explain to them why this is not

649
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:47,780
Explain to them that the queen of England basically runs Canada

650
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:51,940
And I presume Australia as well and maybe there's a whole bunch of other former colonies

651
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,940
She's in charge of technically

652
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:58,660
So uh yeah, you're not going to see that on the news not not for a while at least

653
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,780
Or

654
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,380
Anywhere where is the outrage this is crazy

655
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,220
They're not working for us

656
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,220
They're screwing us

657
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,180
Yep

658
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,340
Hell yeah

659
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:15,940
Uh, a link that I picked up from the drop for drop.io slash daily source code this was

660
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:21,860
Um, let's see it's not of it. It's not a mainstream article but I did like the article itself from spiked

661
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,580
Online

662
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,060
The title is are EU deaf or what

663
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:32,260
Four times European voters have said no to European Union document

664
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,940
même now there was a referendum in Ireland on June 7th

665
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,260
2001 that was the niece treaty

666
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:44,020
In France and Holland on the 29th of May and the 1st of June 2005 that was for the European

667
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:48,420
Constitution voted down out goodbye get out and most recently again in Ireland

668
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,780
Well God bless the iris the 12th of June 2008

669
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:55,780
They voted down the Lisbon Treaty the only country the only member state

670
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,620
There was allowed to uh have a referendum on the topic the rest of the

671
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,260
Member states jammed it through their own

672
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,660
Their own represent representative governments despite

673
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:12,420
Outrage although not outrage enough clearly from the populace all four times

674
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,860
European leaders responded by effectively saying you know no doesn't really mean no

675
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,860
That's right 11th and 12th December that's tomorrow and Friday

676
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:27,620
European leaders will be meeting to find what they call a quote solution to the quote

677
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,620
Irish problem

678
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
Irish people out there

679
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,980
Yet green chuckle heads calling and let me know how you feel and I know you're out there and listening

680
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,980
I'd love to you know this is what I'd love to have a live show now

681
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,380
We're boom someone from Ireland could call in

682
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,940
I know it would work. I know you're out there. I know you're listening

683
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,220
We really need to talk about this because they're gonna do another vote

684
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,380
They're gonna try and ram it through and they need it

685
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:57,380
They need it for this new world order for the world government that Gordon Brown now is basically

686
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,700
I mean he's now the hero he's taken over the EU

687
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:07,140
Drive towards a one form of financial government and and in general

688
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,860
Just a one world government. I was just talking with with the lady pee about this

689
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,980
About Amsterdam about them shutting down the coffee shops and and severely

690
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:20,500
Restricting the sex services industry

691
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,260
What I'll call it okay hookers, but the sex services industry

692
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,940
And she says what is that that's crazy? Why is it honey?

693
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:36,260
It's no coincidence that this takes place on the same moment the very same moment that it's happening in the United Kingdom

694
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,260
And it's happening in other countries because they're harmonizing it

695
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:44,980
They want us to have one set of rules one world no more sovereignty

696
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,300
You all your base belongs to them literally. That's what they're going for

697
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:53,140
That's what they want that is what we should be fighting against so the

698
00:48:53,700 --> 00:49:01,940
Particularly in Europe the EU Lisbon treaty must be stopped at all costs because that is a technical document

699
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:07,940
Which actually sets them up to put in place a one world government starting with the European Union

700
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:14,820
They're already acting you can read it now in mainstream articles that acting under what they call the Lisbon principles

701
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,660
So even though it's not law

702
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:22,420
They're already acting under this humongous confusing legal document that they put in place

703
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,500
So they could do all these things

704
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,580
We got to be on the lookout. We got to be careful and we've got to act

705
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,300
And we can look at history for ways to

706
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:35,140
to react and for ways to protest. There were some very successful

707
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,100
things going on in the

708
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:45,540
In the past couple hundred years and here's one coming back. I think that's actually took place in oh seven as well

709
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:51,220

You can get the details at the Boston Tea Party zero eight dot com and what it is is

713

714
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,380
For the nomination for Republican candidate

715

718
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,660
Dr Rand Paul is going to be there

Someone I never heard about before but it's actually Ron Paul's it's fun his son and

The up currency we have is and how it's

729
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,860
destroying economies and lives

730
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,980
You really have no choice but to

731
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,620

732
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:21,220

20, 20, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10

768
00:54:48,540 --> 00:55:18,540
10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10

769
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:36,720
10, 10!

770
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:43,720
If a Gaurant shot!

771
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:59,720
What if aonsiderer shot?

772
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:29,720
I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I

773
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:59,720
never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've ever seen you, I've never seen you, I've ever seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've ever seen you, I've never Zie you, I've rarely known you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've ever seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, I've never seen you, you,

774
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:41,720
I've always loved the Matrix soundtrack of Wake Up.

775
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,720
Oh man, great song that is.

776
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,720
I was just looking for a, for a little bit of background music.

777
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,720
I wanted to do a little, a little runlinks that pass the drop.

778
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,720
And I look at the final new stories for today,

779
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,720
but now I can't seem to find a second I had.

780
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,720
I'd like just like a little bit of background music.

781
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,720
Where is it?

782
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,720
I've got so much stuff I've been downloading.

783
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,720
Let me see if this is any good.

784
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,720
Hold on, let me, uh,

785
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,720
maybe you'll just have to skip it.

786
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,720
There was a great, there was a really good instrumental song that I heard.

787
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,720
Um, let me see if I can, it was, I had a cute up earlier.

788
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,720
Uh, maybe it was this one.

789
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,720
Hold on, let me see.

790
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,720
No, all right, I can't find it.

791
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,720
Forget about it.

792
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,720
We'll just cruise by the drop and we'll do without background music.

793
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,720
Okay, so here's what's brand new as of,

794
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:42,720
2012 PM, uh, UK time on December 10th, 2008, uh,

795
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,720
US car giant bailout.

796
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,720
This is probably what I was just talking about.

797
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,720
Uh, this is where, uh,

798
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,720
the government, the Federal Reserve, the government, the Federal Reserve,

799
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,720
which of course the private institution of banks,

800
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,720
they don't actually really want to bail out the, uh,

801
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,720
the big automakers with their money.

802
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,720
They want to give it to their friends.

803
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,720
They don't feel that that's an appropriate use of funds.

804
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,720
That's going to be very interesting.

805
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,720
In the meantime, Goldman Sachs,

806
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:13,720
one of the top five US municipal bond underwriters.

807
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,720
Okay, municipal bond is basically a, um,

808
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,720
a loan, usually by a municipality, like, uh,

809
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,720
the state of New York.

810
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,720
So the, uh, the underwriters are saying, you know,

811
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:31,720
you should buy, uh, default insurance on New Jersey,

812
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,720
amongst other states.

813
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,720
You could probably do it on New York as well.

814
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,720
Because, uh, you know, the basically their analysts are saying,

815
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,720
you know, the New Jersey's probably going to default.

816
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:46,720
So you should bet against New Jersey being able to actually pay for their debts.

817
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,720
This is Goldman Sachs, the recipient of, of,

818
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,720
of most of our money that we've been giving.

819
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,720
And what kind of cock suckers are these guys?

820
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,720
That's fucking crazy.

821
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,720
That's a Bloomberg story, by the way.

822
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,720
Another Bloomberg story.

823
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,720
Congressional panel overseeing US bailout citizens, uh,

824
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,720
uh, treasury.

825
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,720
Oversight committees that are by Congress criticize the US treasury

826
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,720
for not using the $700 billion bailout financial by, by, by bailout

827
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,720
to help average Americans.

828
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,720
And questions.

829
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,720
It's commitment to stem home foreclosures.

830
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,720
Oh, sure.

831
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,720
Uh, hello.

832
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,720
Uh, they're not actually doing what they said they would do.

833
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,720
How dumb are you people?

834
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,720
You know, you let them turn off the phones and turn off the email

835
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,720
and the website so we couldn't actually tell you what we actually thought

836
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,720
and that we did not believe.

837
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:36,720
This is a good idea.

838
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,720
You want to head and did anyway.

839
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,720
Now you're saying, well, well, well, well, well, well, well,

840
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,720
well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well,

841
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,720
uh, make me angry.

842
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,720
Well, this is an interesting one.

843
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,720
Gunt's for food and Los Angeles.

844
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:54,720
Oh, unfortunately, the, uh, I say someone screwed up the, uh, the URL.

845
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,720
Let me see if I can change that and you got to be careful

846
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,720
when you post links to the drop.

847
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,720
Sometimes they can screw up.

848
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,720
Here we go.

849
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,720
Los Angeles from, uh,

850
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,720
what's the AFP?

851
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,720
That's not just associated.

852
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,720
Is that associated financial press?

853
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:15,080
An annual guns for gifts and disease scheme in the crime-ridden Los Angeles District of

854
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,160
Compton saw record spiking yet another sign of the A-ling U.S. economy.

855
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,120
It's the guns for food program.

856
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:26,120
Give us your guns so that if you get really hungry and angry, you won't come after us.

857
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,360
And we'll give you some food.

858
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,160
Nice.

859
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,160
Don't give up your guns.

860
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:36,720
I'd say, go out and shoot some foxes or, yeah, by the way, how many foxes are walking

861
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:41,040
around in, of the streets of London, and I'm not talking about cute-looking girls.

862
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,600
I'm talking about actual foxes walking around in the daylight.

863
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,880
Oh, man, there's so many more things.

864
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,880
I'm going to be noticing once I live in the city.

865
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,720
It's going to be an out-rage.

866
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,760
Let's see what else do we have.

867
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,760
Poor families, pressed into vaccine trials by drug companies, 12 babies die.

868
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,760
I don't even have to go into that to know what that's all about.

869
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,760
Peter Schiff on your money.

870
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,760
Yeah, that's actually a pretty good YouTube video.

871
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,760
There's another good one.

872
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:12,080
Remember the guy that I was telling you about who founded the weather channel?

873
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:18,480
He is now along with 30,000 scientists, is suing Al Gore.

874
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,080
I'm just going to play the beginning of this clip.

875
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,640
Let me ask you, I want to sue Al Gore.

876
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,200
This is from Fox News.

877
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:30,800
It's a YouTube clip, link in the show notes at deadlysourceco.com, crosspass, crossposted at

878
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,800
curie.com.

879
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:37,440
I'm going to show Red Eye, which I presume was on in the middle of the night.

880
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,440
But listen to this.

881
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,440
You're a fraud.

882
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,960
The illegal challenge will settle the global warming debate once and for all.

883
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,240
These John Coleman and he founded the Weather Channel, my favorite channel has some of the

884
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,240
hottest women there.

885
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,240
And now he works as a Weatherman for...

886
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,240
I like that.

887
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,280
My favorite channel has some of the hottest women there.

888
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,000
This guy should be doing the show with me.

889
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And San Diego, he knows warm fronts like I know cold cut.

890
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
So, John, why do you want to sue Al Gore?

891
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Well, the deal is this great.

892
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:11,000
We have tried and tried and tried to get a debate on global warming for scientists on the other side.

893
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Al Gore, any of the scientists behind him over the UNIPCC, without the heavy debate with him.

894
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
But they said, oh no, the debate is over.

895
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Yeah.

896
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Now that you hear that?

897
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
The debate is over.

898
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
They don't want anyone talking about this.

899
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
The debate is over.

900
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
We're all set up.

901
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
We've got all the carbon taxes in place.

902
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
You know, to actually get a parking permit, I have to know the CO2,

903
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:41,000
milligram, or gram per kilometer of my vehicle.

904
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
We've got the carbon credits being rolled into the new financial system, which is being worked on.

905
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
We'll probably hear about that in February or March.

906
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
It'll come out of the European Union.

907
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,000
And as the dollar collapses, and it's going to happen because of all the money we've been printing.

908
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Everyone in the United States will be a part of this as well.

909
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
So, no debate because this is done.

910
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
We've got to push through.

911
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
It only took a couple of years.

912
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
We're done.

913
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
We're done here.

914
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Our work is done.

915
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:12,000
We have 30,000 scientists, 9,000 PhDs, who have signed up to debunk global warming.

916
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
And they still won't listen to us.

917
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
You realize that Fox is the only cable network that will put us on the air.

918
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
CNN won't.

919
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:25,000
That other thing in Western BC and CBS, ABC and BC, they haven't.

920
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
They saw that.

921
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
We are, we can't get on the air.

922
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
But once the internet, you wouldn't even know I existed.

923
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
The whole deal is that somehow we have to be heard.

924
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
So we figure maybe a quarter long.

925
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Now let me ask you.

926
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Why hasn't our responded to you?

927
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Is he scared?

928
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
This is good.

929
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And now you're going to hear how the system really works.

930
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Okay.

931
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
So why?

932
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Why is it so hard to debunk Al Gore?

933
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Well, the system is working in his favor.

934
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Listen, as Mr. Cole brings it home.

935
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Or is he just pretending you don't exist?

936
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Well, I think you can guide us as just a little net.

937
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
So he's a former Vice President of the United States.

938
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
He's got an Oscar.

939
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
He's got a Grammy.

940
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
He's got a hundred million dollars.

941
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
He's got a Nobel Peace Prize.

942
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
He's got a staring.

943
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
That's the worst.

944
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Are you saying you say?

945
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
All right.

946
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
You should go take a look at that clip.

947
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
It's entirety.

948
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Will worth the price of admission.

949
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Which, of course.

950
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
It's free.

951
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Let's see.

952
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
What else do we have?

953
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Obama sending mixed messages on marijuana.

954
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Oh, yeah.

955
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
It'll be another lie.

956
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
He's going to come after people using medical marijuana.

957
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
You watch.

958
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Just another lie.

959
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
When else did I have in my own list there?

960
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Okay.

961
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Let's continue down the drop.

962
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Let's just see what else we've got.

963
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
What do the Clinton's have on Obama?

964
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
The salon article, not bad.

965
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Given Obama's elaborate deferrence to the Clinton's beginning with his over accommodation

966
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
of them at the Democratic Convention in August,

967
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
a nagging question has floated around the web.

968
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
What do the Clinton's have on him?

969
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Well, I would say their own body count would be the thing they have on him.

970
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
It's like 40 people that have committed suicide or have died under other

971
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
strange circumstances as it relates to the Clinton's.

972
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
And this has got to be my favorite.

973
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
This, this tops it all.

974
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Now, just so you know, in television land, where it is very hard to pay for the

975
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
shows if it's not a reality show with big sponsors, big audience,

976
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
calling voting.

977
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:26,000
We're all the nice little good slaves or hypnotized and watching bad singers.

978
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And it pretty much doesn't fly.

979
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
So the government does find a lot of love.

980
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Something with all your heart.

981
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
We are.

982
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Hold on.

983
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
That's the trailer.

984
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I didn't even know that was going to auto play.

985
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
That's cool.

986
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
So the government pays for a lot of programming.

987
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
This is definitely paid for programming.

988
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
It is coming soon in January.

989
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:53,000
It is a new reality show that will make you realize just how safe we all are is called

990
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Homeland Security U.S.A.

991
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
On your heart.

992
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
We are hurting home friends.

993
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
You'll protect it with everything you got.

994
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Tuesday, January 6th on ABC.

995
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
modular using their children is covered in trying to drug us in.

996
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
That's just a spectacle.

997
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
A new series about the heroes who keep us safe at home.

998
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Really across.

999
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
We know what we're doing.

1000
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
They have nothing to be afraid of anymore.

1001
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
We're going to make sure that they're okay.

1002
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Since Homeland Security U.S.A.

1003
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
From here's Tuesday, January 6th on ABC.

1004
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
You are safe.

1005
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Stay in your homes.

1006
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Nothing will happen.

1007
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Protect us from harm.

1008
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Ha ha ha.

1009
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Oh my god.

1010
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I can't wait to see that.

1011
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Oh.

1012
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
That is just that's outrageous.

1013
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Absolutely outrageous.

1014
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Homeland Security U.S.A.

1015
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
There's tons of trailers.

1016
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Yeah.

1017
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
People are despicable.

1018
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
They're using their children to smuggle in drugs.

1019
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Unlike the U.S.

1020
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Government would just invade entire countries.

1021
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
And then flies the drugs in on government.

1022
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,000
They're craft.

1023
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Well, so we have.

1024
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Let's see.

1025
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Labor government in the UK.

1026
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
It makes it even harder to sell your home.

1027
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Of course.

1028
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
They don't actually want you to get out of any trouble you might be in.

1029
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Man.

1030
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
There's just, there's, you know what?

1031
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
This is why we have to move over to a live scenario.

1032
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
So we can go through seven or eight stories in a day.

1033
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
What has it been now?

1034
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
But an hour.

1035
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I think I've definitely hit my tax.

1036
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Oops.

1037
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Sorry.

1038
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Didn't need to roll out the man alone.

1039
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Man again.

1040
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I want to play a little bit of a happy French song for you.

1041
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I think it will lift up your spirits and make you feel better.

1042
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
To do the mall on a store school.

1043
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
To do the mall.

1044
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
To do the mall.

1045
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
To do the mall.

1046
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
To do the mall.

1047
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
To do the mall.

1048
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
To do the mall.

1049
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
To do the mall.

1050
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
To do the mall.

1051
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
To do the mall.

1052
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
To do the mall.

1053
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
To do the mall.

1054
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
To do the mall.

1055
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
To do the mall.

1056
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
To do the mall.

1057
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,680
To do the mall.

1058
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:21,000
To do the mall.

1059
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
To do the mall.

1060
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
To do the mall.

1061
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
To do the mall.

1062
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:52,660
Tady, Do what I really want to do

1063
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:54,280
as if

1064
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:58,500
I love you

1065
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,560
We're looking for each other

1066
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:06,380
to feel that rev'ed

1067
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,100
our own set

1068
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,360
But it wasn't very well

1069
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,440
Butび answer!

1070
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,420
Time is up

1071
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:20,860
Mobile

1072
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:44,860
I actually help with the translation of the song in the show now.

1073
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:50,860
It basically means taking easy slow down slowly will be okay.

1074
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:57,860
And only the French can sing in that way a fantastic song at the end of this daily source code episode number eight hundred and ten.

1075
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:59,860
We will talk again for the football Friday.

1076
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:02,860
No doubt about that as we move closer to the big move day.

1077
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:09,860
Engineers gear heads bit heads people out there with ideas from my two technical challenges.

1078
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:13,860
A about a great streaming service so we can stream live.

1079
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:19,860
B about a phone switch preferably a service so I can really stack up phone calls,

1080
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:25,860
put people on hold conference and do all of this from the comfort of a web browser or something easily configurable on the machine.

1081
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,860
It can be void by any other system.

1082
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:31,860
I don't care as long as people in just calling with cell phones or regular phones and we can have a nice chat.

1083
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:36,860
And of course for you guys I'd love to hear back from what you think about the idea of taking it live.

1084
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:40,860
Around 3 p.m. every single day united kingdom time.

1085
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:46,860
So to do to do to do some all take it easy enjoy your freedom and live your life with passion.
