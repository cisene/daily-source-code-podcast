1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I should be really happy and I just should be bouncing off the walls which of course I am but I'm extremely troubled by fellow charcoalheads.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm really concerned about what's going on and somewhere in September is when the war will start involving the United States Iran Israel and Pakistan.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It seems like in a way we're awakening, we're becoming aware of things, things are happening around us and the worldly powers that they are fighting it.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The first time I've been tracking oil prices, you know, this is almost the hobby of mine.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
In fact, today being Wednesday, 253 p.m., I saw the oil go down yesterday drastically.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That sounds like 135 dollars a barrel which to me meant something's up.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In low and behold, just as I thought this morning, where it comes that Iran is testing missiles and there's a rumbling in the Gulf.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Of course, oil starts to pop up, it is now at 8.53 a.m. in New York.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oil is almost up to $2 a barrel.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There's clearly things going on that Iran just never wanted to play game with the dollar currency for oil.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They've threatened to flood the world markets with cheap oil and paste that trading upon the euro.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It seems like the only answer, the only solution is to come up with a reason to go to war and then actually go into it.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Do you feel a repeat if there's a days of who has been in your mind at all with the Iran?

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:45,000
One and two, the disastrous, disastrous decisions that are being made towards fellow men, women, all the majority of them are under 30 years old in Iran.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It must not be.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's kind of scary, but it's kind of scary.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You're supposed to add $0.25 to the iron.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You know, they've been through this journey for your claim that you're in prison.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You worked for it.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
For the attack, I run.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Played this year.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's talked of a meeting.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's clear.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Program's folder.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No echo, probably.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You know, all the file on the clock.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Coding is really national rating.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
For it's something that ain't completely clear.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He's political up to you.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You don't need one of more to the attack.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
For it's day to day was present.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm glad he ended his last day in August.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
January 2019.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You know, Ronald Reagan and his efforts to bring the ring here.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,000
They won't forget what they'll see.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
They didn't finish the discharge.

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000

$16 million worth of airplane strap to my ass.

132
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

134

Coaching life.

140
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And when you said it, no, maybe I ran in.

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
From time to time, I think it's true.

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But when you told me, no, I think you won't be.

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I know it's time for me to go.

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Coaching life.

145
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000

Coaching life.

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And when I think about it today,

150
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
My mind is about it's time to think about it.

151
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And when you said it, no, maybe I ran in.

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Coaching life.

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
No, I think I don't.

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You were saying, I've never listened to it anyway.

155
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You said you love for me was disappeared.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Just like the clouds of sunny days.

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I want you by.

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No, I want you by.

159
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No, I want you by.

160
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Oh, man, I've always been a fan of these guys.

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's the fire range.

162
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Of course, they are entirely pod save from the pod save music network,

163
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
find it at podsafemusic.com.

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I want you back kicking off for the triple seven edition of the Charlie.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Hey, everybody, how you doing.

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Welcome to the daily source code coming to you.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Once again from the affluent suburb of Surrey known as gulford,

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
where it's 27 degrees centigrade today,

169
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
even though there's no sun shining.

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's a ball me, so you can probably hear the fan that I've got running

171
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
to the background because it's going to kind of hot up here in the attic.

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And that to start off, I want to say major major thanks to our buddy Ray Raymond,

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
who has been a charcoal head and certainly elevated to savon status

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
of the the daily source code for a number of years.

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He created that entire opening and I got to tell you, I love that stuff, man.

176
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I love it, particularly how you.

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
How you basically are mashing me up into something completely new,

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
a whole new product, if you will.

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Excuse me, a whole new show, which of course deserves to open up a daily source code.

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And I just wish I had, I love doing that stuff.

181
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I wish I had the time for it, man.

182
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Fantastic.

183
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And he came like that, you know, you make my day.

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So Ray, thank you once again.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But spending some time looking around some stuff as usual.

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What I did yesterday, for most of, like for hours on end,

187
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I went through all of the voicemail comments on multiple lines

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
for the past week when I was on vacation.

189
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You can imagine just the volume.

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And obviously, you know, I want to listen everything

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
because there could be that gem could be sitting in there

192
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and I don't want to miss out.

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So we'll be listening to a number of you guys calling in today.

194
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Some funny, some sad, some happy, some some glad.

195
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Also, I bumped into a video that I guess I had seen a couple of pieces from me.

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I thought I'd pretty much seen every 9, 11 truth video out there

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
that matters or that seems to have, you know,

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
some real journalist equality to it.

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But that probably don't.

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And this is 9, 11 press for truth.

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't know if you ever seen that one.

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's, you know, it has interviews that were made with the jersey girls,

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
these four new jersey women, young women who lost their husbands

204
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and one of the lost their son in the twin towers.

205
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And it's a really good, just a fantastic journalistic piece.

206
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And of course, if I remember, I'll put a link in the show notes to it.

207
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But you can Google it 9, 11 press for truth.

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's pretty simple to find this kind of stuff through the tools that we have

209
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
at our fingertips, I might add.

210
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And from that, I, even though, of course, I was aware of the 9, 11 timelines.

211
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'd never really, you know, spent any time looking at it.

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And a couple of things dawned on.

213
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I mean, at the original 9, 11 timeline,

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
which I believe was published as a book as terror timeline,

215
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
was done by Paul Thompson.

216
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And this 9, 11 press for truth, you know,

217
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
it's a lot about this timeline and how all the pieces were put together.

218
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And it really started to dawn on me.

219
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What is actually going wrong in, in our understanding of what's happening

220
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
in worldly events?

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And at first, I was probably of the journalism sucks school, mainstream media blows.

222
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And that's not entirely true when you look at this 9, 11 press for truth

223
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
because although you don't have the ground swell of the importance

224
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
of Britney Spears shaving her head, the words are out there.

225
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And this, you know, basically by using a very simple database structure,

226
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Paul Thompson started off by putting together mainstream news reports.

227
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So that's newspaper.

228
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Oh, online stuff, of course.

229
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But mainly online newspaper stories,

230
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
accompanying stories that go with video for news outlets,

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
like seeing any international and, of course, video clips.

232
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And you really get a whole different picture that is pieced together

233
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
or what happened, of course.

234
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We pretty much have a good understanding of it at this point.

235
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
At least we know that it's completely different from what was portrayed

236
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
in the 9, 11 Commission report.

237
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And I'm thinking, you know, so this means that the mainstream is getting the news out

238
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
there, but it's actually one step above the journalists.

239
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Okay.

240
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's probably a couple more steps above it if you really think about it.

241
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And I've witnessed this myself when working for Viacom,

242
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
indirectly, of course, for MTV Network.

243
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry, even one level below that.

244
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
MTV, you see how all those levels, how they're important and how

245
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
the, and it's obvious, by the way.

246
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And a lot of it is profit driven.

247
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It has nothing to do with patriotism or lack of patriotism.

248
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's what a, what a company does.

249
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
A company is there to protect itself from losing.

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So, and of course, then, you know, that comes from really, really top levels

251
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
where, you know, advertisers pull out and all kinds of crap happens.

252
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So that's why we don't get that groundswell of news.

253
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I said, you know, when Lindsey Lowhand gets busted, booze

254
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and up and drive around town again.

255
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And that's, that gets all the attention because it's safe.

256
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's completely safe.

257
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's why it gets propagated so far and wide.

258
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But there are a number of, let's just call them massive points of light

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
that are out there reporting the, the truth reporting things

260
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
that may not be popular with the typical news desk and their editors

261
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
out there that are letting it go through.

262
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And I'm seeing it sometimes even in letters to the editor.

263
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That seems to be a very popular pace or certainly not on the front page.

264
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's always buried down a little bit deeper.

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And if you can really start to pull all these things together,

266
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
then, you know, you get a real true story.

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That also, of course, is the way that the 911 truth movement

268
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
has started and I see it moving globally.

269
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I really can feel the movement on this.

270
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And we just have to keep copying pasting.

271
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Copy, paste, copy, paste.

272
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Get the word out.

273
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Let people know.

274
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And please send messages to your representatives.

275
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It actually does work.

276
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And this 911 press for truth even shows you how it works.

277
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
When the, the presidential daily briefing had to be,

278
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
the classified and released.

279
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It was because of severe pressure from the public writing their senators

280
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
in the congressmen or, you know,

281
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
it might be your minister of parliament or your prime minister.

282
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Or your queen or your king.

283
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You've got to keep you got to keep the pressure up because the one thing

284
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
these guys and they're not, they're not really the ones who are the bad guys.

285
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
They're just robots in between.

286
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You know, we're too lazy or we decided a long time ago that we want someone else

287
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
to do our dirty work for us, basically run shit.

288
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So they do whatever they're told.

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And if we're not telling them, well, someone else is clearly telling them.

290
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So you just gotta keep the word out there and gotta keep telling your representatives.

291
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It is not futile whatsoever.

292
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I know sometimes it gets tiring and you just want to have a happy little life

293
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
for the white-picked fence and a ta-da-da-da-da-da-da.

294
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll have to work the apron.

295
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But life just ain't like that anymore now is it.

296
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Hey Adam, this is David.

297
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Long time listener calling from the Brooklyn Keys Express way

298
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and downtown Brooklyn.

299
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're in traffic.

300
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Getting all bummed out, burning my fossil.

301
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You're listening to you talk about the world bank

302
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and the big conspiracy.

303
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You're bumming me out, man.

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
No blue pill.

305
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
No red pill.

306
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I want the shiny happy yellow pill, man.

307
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I want to live like an ostrich with my head in the ground and be happy.

308
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I tried to yellow pill once.

309
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's overrated.

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Come on.

311
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What happened to the good old days?

312
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What happened when you were living in Amsterdam still

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
when the show first started and the simple shows

314
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
that you'd put your mic to the door and listen to you

315
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and even sleep to the arrow.

316
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I missed the simple days.

317
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I missed the strategy.

318
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah, baby dude.

319
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
My brother.

320
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I missed it too.

321
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I really, really do.

322
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm telling you.

323
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But I feel so much lighter and so much better.

324
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Now that I've awakened and I've seen what is actually going on.

325
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I think I found something to do.

326
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Of course, I got three jobs.

327
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I got plenty of work.

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But really a passion, something I really want to work on.

329
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You'll feel great, man.

330
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You just got to kind of get through it.

331
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You can see everything.

332
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Then even the news becomes great because you hear the keywords.

333
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You have the information.

334
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And there's action you can take.

335
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You can do something with everything that's bothering you.

336
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And we'll get back there, my brother.

337
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We will.

338
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And by the way, I had a great week off.

339
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah.

340
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I followed the news.

341
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But I had a great week off.

342
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You can shut it off.

343
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Once you're awake, it's easy to shut it off.

344
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm not really complaining.

345
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I do like the show.

346
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I listen every day.

347
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But man, the world's bombing me out.

348
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Dude.

349
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh.

350
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I got to go home and go ride my motorcycle.

351
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Hell yeah.

352
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And some fossil fuel.

353
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It'd be.

354
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Burn it with some fog.

355
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah.

356
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
He's out.

357
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
All right, man.

358
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah.

359
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
They work for me.

360
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Hell yeah.

361
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You know what they do.

362
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's right.

363
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We just got to remind him from time to time.

364
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That really, that really will work.

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm convinced of that.

366
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And I go ahead and burn some fossil fuel, man.

367
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Don't worry about it.

368
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Let me check oil for you right now.

369
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Oh, boy.

370
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Something's going on.

371
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I love it when this happens.

372
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Let's see.

373
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Only a couple weeks ago, oil was at $146.

374
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It is currently.

375
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And today is Wednesday, the 23rd of July, 2008.

376
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It is currently down $220.

377
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It is at $126.

378
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's at $122.

379
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's at $840 AM.

380
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah.

381
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Eastern time.

382
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's $20 in the span of less than a week.

383
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
$20.

384
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Only in in four or five trading days.

385
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Look at this.

386
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Now, what does that mean?

387
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
First of all, it means you should go ahead and burn some damn fossil fuel, my friend.

388
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Go ahead.

389
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Because clearly, there's no more supply and demand issue.

390
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That seems to be dwindling pretty quickly.

391
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
We'll talk later about what that could actually mean.

392
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't want to bum you out while you're thinking about hopping on your hog and going for a ride.

393
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Although, don't tell me you might have a rice burner.

394
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah.

395
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I have them questions.

396
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Thank you.

397
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
First question.

398
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I think you might possibly have been on something when you were talking about the British possibly

399
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
taking too much alcohol and things like that.

400
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The report just came out last night.

401
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
800,000 cases of alcohol related illnesses in hospitals.

402
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
In hospitals.

403
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah.

404
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And I think that was in the past year.

405
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That's almost a million people in hospitals.

406
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Only 60 million here.

407
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And that you know a lot of them just aren't going to drink, although you don't know.

408
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But you think really old and really young, like babies.

409
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
800,000.

410
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yeah.

411
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That's pretty concerning.

412
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'd say Chris.

413
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's okay.

414
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's just a blue pill, man.

415
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You can take the red one.

416
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And then you can take a blue one whenever you want.

417
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
One, you got to take the red first though.

418
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You got to wake it up.

419
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You got to stop numbering yourself.

420
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Okay.

421
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Look at me.

422
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm totally self-medicated.

423
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Anywho, I'm called a number of my phone telling them,

424
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm quite a big secret.

425
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I can't remember who it was.

426
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Some kind of thing I saw in my phone book.

427
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It wasn't you who I called was it.

428
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
No.

429
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If it was, but in the ringback, you know my,

430
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
well, you know my email address.

431
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah.

432
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's the same email I'm at.

433
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Okay.

434
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That's a fuck, that's hope it wasn't.

435
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Skype.

436
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And a phone together will mix it alcohol.

437
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I do not go.

438
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Do not get this any Skype phone.

439
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Do not drink alcohol.

440
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
This is a good sign.

441
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The sign, good suggestion.

442
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Anyway, I don't see a PSO at the SD.

443
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
They're supposed to go and not say if you're a fucker.

444
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What do you think you're a fucker?

445
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That is a...

446
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm lucky.

447
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
All right.

448
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I mean, no.

449
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm drunk.

450
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah.

451
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yes.

452
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Good night.

453
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There's some about people when they get plastered

454
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
calling me up, I like.

455
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You check this guy out.

456
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Hey, Mr. Curry.

457
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh.

458
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah.

459
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This is Jason the truck driver.

460
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Hey, man.

461
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm sitting in Oklahoma right now.

462
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Backbone of America, my friend.

463
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The truck drivers.

464
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And dude, I love the daily source code.

465
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Man.

466
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
From those first time I heard it, it's been awesome.

467
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
That's coming for you, my friend.

468
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That's a huge compliment.

469
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I really appreciate it.

470
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You've been traveling around the great states of America.

471
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And you have a lot of choice of stuff you can listen to.

472
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So I take that as a as a big one.

473
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Your audio quality is what got me.

474
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I mean, although you're on a Mac now again.

475
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And you should switch back to the bio or you should donate the bio to me actually.

476
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah, man.

477
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I do another laptop to one I have.

478
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Did he just built?

479
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Do I have to solder the power back?

480
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The power cable back onto the board.

481
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Because I accidentally ripped it out of the machine.

482
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I hate it when it happens.

483
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah.

484
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That is kind of the cool thing about that.

485
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Magnetic plug.

486
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
That shit doesn't happen to me anymore.

487
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And believe me, it's not only happened to me.

488
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
My daughter is the champion of tripping over laptop wires.

489
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm 36.

490
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm white.

491
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And not gay.

492
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm on the straight.

493
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Other not homophobic.

494
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Right out.

495
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And.

496
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And you've got men.

497
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm gay right.

498
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Fucking.

499
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Oh, bro.

500
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Can you probably figure that out right now?

501
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I feel so much a part of your family.

502
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Oh, yeah.

503
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh, I love it.

504
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I got a ping from Yon Poletti said, you know, dude, you were on vacation.

505
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Then we didn't hear anything on Friday.

506
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It was the deal when I said to myself,

507
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Well, crap.

508
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
That's right.

509
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yon still has a hit test.

510
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Ready for me.

511
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
13.

512
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm proud of your casting.

513
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
We're hungry.

514
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
This is the hit test.

515
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yon Poletti.

516
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Hey, Adam.

517
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
How are you doing?

518
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm good man.

519
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm ready for it.

520
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You see this number 130.

521
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You're going to start right away with intro number one.

522
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
All right.

523
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Rock.

524
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What?

525
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's not going to be no one.

526
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
These obscure years that I know nothing about.

527
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Is it?

528
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Okay.

529
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm have to give up on that one.

530
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Number two.

531
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I know this one.

532
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I know this one from my Z100 days.

533
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's a Jodie Wattley.

534
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm looking for a new log.

535
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Unmistachable.

536
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And number three.

537
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah.

538
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Telling low.

539
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Easy.

540
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Wild thing.

541
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What is that like 89 or something?

542
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It must be 87 or 88.

543
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah, 87 or 88.

544
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I think.

545
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's it.

546
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And this week's answers are all from.

547
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
98.

548
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, no.

549
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Just.

550
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What the hell is this?

551
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's a number one.

552
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Wets, wets, wets, wets.

553
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I never looked at those guys.

554
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Not never got into wet wet wet wet wet.

555
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Well, this won't be included on the soundtrack to my life.

556
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I can't sing along with wet wet wet.

557
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Sweets are in.

558
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Resents number one.

559
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Oh.

560
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
There we go.

561
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Resents number two.

562
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Jodie Wattley.

563
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Hell yeah.

564
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Let me use the pump this out over New York City.

565
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Real love.

566
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Got to have me.

567
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
But it was looking for new love.

568
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Jodie Wattley.

569
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Former member of Shawlamar.

570
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Real love is on number two.

571
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Plus.

572
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And this is answering number three.

573
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Also from 1989.

574
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Wild thing.

575
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yes.

576
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's so long.

577
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Working.

578
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Oh, we.

579
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Not five.

580
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Oh, my money.

581
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So on the weekend comes.

582
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I go get live.

583
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
We're not honey.

584
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Wild thing.

585
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Wild thing.

586
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Answer number three.

587
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Don't look.

588
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And that's it for hit this number 130.

589
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So at him, how did you do this week?

590
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Well, I thought I did better.

591
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But I did three out of possible six.

592
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You are because I got Jodie Wattley's title.

593
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
That's better.

594
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You hit this.

595
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
That's me.

596
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
If you don't come, it's the place to find the answers to this hit this.

597
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And any older hit this as well.

598
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And also to find the links to iTunes.

599
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So you can find.

600
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Bye.

601
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Sorry.

602
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
All the tracks featured in the hit this online.

603
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Alrighty.

604
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And thank you for playing.

605
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Everyone else.

606
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Thank you for listening.

607
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Next week I'll be back for another hit this.

608
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So until then take care.

609
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Have fun.

610
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And try to think with your heart.

611
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Bye bye.

612
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Thank you.

613
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah.

614
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Thank you, man.

615
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Another Dutch guy who just does a fabulous job on putting stuff together for the Charlie

616
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
and of course much appreciated.

617
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Y'all pull out there with hit test number 130.

619
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
More awakening stories coming in through the voicemail lines.

620
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Which you can find in the show notes at dailysourceco.com.

621
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
More of course crossposted at curie.com.

622
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Hey Adam.

623
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
This is Chris and Philadelphia.

624
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I have a comment on FOIA.

625
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's one of the things that you're opinion on something I've been dealing with.

626
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I feel like a bit of a hypocrite.

627
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You know, I really care about the environment.

628
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't want to waste.

629
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You know, I turn off my lights when I can.

630
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I bring bags to the grocery store.

631
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And yet when I go to work, I take.

632
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You know, I screen print logos on to pieces of plastic that come from China.

633
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And we ship them off.

634
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And we import, you know, watches.

635
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And ship from China and all this mess.

636
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And it's reading that article about China in Africa on the drop.

637
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It gets me worried.

638
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Like how can I, you know, go home on one day.

639
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Like I'm running a bike to work and take public transit.

640
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And then go to work.

641
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And then, you know, fuck around with all this acrylic.

642
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Oh, man.

643
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
All right.

644
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Hold on a second.

645
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
All right.

646
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
First of all, look, you're, you're just getting by, man.

647
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You got a job.

648
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You got to do it.

649
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Do what you got to do.

650
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And at least you're not chained to the machines yet, right?

651
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yet.

652
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And, and, and, and, and, and, you know,

653
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
there's people just like you in China.

654
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And in Iran.

655
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And in Australia.

656
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And we have a lot of things in common.

657
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And yeah, we're.

658
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yeah, we're.

659
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
We certainly may not be doing the best at working within the environment.

660
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And it, that is mother earth, but get on your bike, man.

661
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
That's not just good for her.

662
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It's good for you as well.

663
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
But it doesn't mean that you're a hypocrite.

664
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You don't want, look, we've been, we've been thrown shit into the earth's atmosphere.

665
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Ever since we could walk up right.

666
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And probably pooping away with CO2 before then.

667
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Which, by the way, is apparently the biggest source of CO2 is cowfarts.

668
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And of course, it's been a lot of lie and going on.

669
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And the biggest part of feeling hypocritical is between your ears.

670
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And you can change that at any moment.

671
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You can change and feel happy whenever you want to.

672
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Think about it.

673
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
There's, there's no one poking you with anything.

674
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
There's no physical weight on your shoulders.

675
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
There, you know, there's, there's nothing physically happening in your physical world.

676
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
That you can see touch, feel, taste, or hear.

677
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That is actually making you unhappy.

678
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
It's all between your ears.

679
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You can change that.

680
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Just think.

681
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm going to be happy now.

682
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And let everything else drop away.

683
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
See, you can do it.

684
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Just think of something happy.

685
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And whenever you want to feel happy, you think of that.

686
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Maybe it's a moment with your kid, a moment with your wife or significant partner.

687
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You know, maybe it's something you accomplished.

688
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Let it make you feel happy.

689
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And don't worry about it.

690
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
We're going to work this out.

691
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
We just got to remove some of the evil shit at the top of the pyramid.

692
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And we do that by not being depressed and just refusing to be enslaved.

693
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
No matter what happens because we can't change this.

694
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Oh crap.

695
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That wasn't a line from Obama.

696
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So instead of just talking about it, do it.

697
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You know, if you feel shitty about what's going on,

698
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
then take charge with your personal actions.

699
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But don't forget to let them know.

700
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
They work for us.

701
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And have you ever felt that, you know, what you're doing to things that seem to be

702
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Dude, every single day of my life, are you kidding me?

703
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Are you kidding me?

704
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
This show, which I've got to skate around, you know, the commercial aspect of it.

705
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's totally in conflict with my commercial interest.

706
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm like, Jacko and Hyde, every single day.

707
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Nothing.

708
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
But that's life.

709
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
That is life.

710
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
MTV, Jacko and Hyde.

711
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You know, we suck up to the record companies on air.

712
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And we slam them off air because we weren't allowed to do it.

713
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Couldn't even make a freaking joke.

714
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Contradictory.

715
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
We're trying to get the word out.

716
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But I'm not using anything.

717
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But I love, I love your opinion.

718
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I had a deal with self-apocracy.

719
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You know, because I'm, I'm struggle.

720
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You know, I'm like, should I just quit the job?

721
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I don't know what I'm doing.

722
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
No, no, no.

723
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
But anyway, man, good show, keep up the good work.

724
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And daily source code.

725
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Hey, it comes out on some day.

726
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
There needs to change, you know, just roll with what you got.

727
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Wait, we don't mind the lapses.

728
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Quality over quantity.

729
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'd be.

730
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Thanks, man.

731
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I appreciate that that seems to be pretty much the consensus, by the way.

732
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
A lot of people respond to that through a voicemail and email.

733
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
A like and also on the drop drop.au slash daily source code.

734
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Saying, it, you know, just call it daily source code.

735
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
We don't care.

736
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's like our little inside joke.

737
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It's not daily.

738
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Okay, get it.

739
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So, yeah, man.

740
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I absolutely, I feel like that.

741
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Of course I do.

742
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That is the constant struggle.

743
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And if you add to that, that there used to be severe ridicule.

744
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And there's still is, of course.

745
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
You know, if you're a truth or if you wear a tinfoil hat, or if you have your wallet

746
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
in a fairer day cage, or if you even mentioned that you think you actually might believe

747
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
that you are full stuff could actually be true.

748
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
All of that stuff?

749
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Of course it's in total conflict.

750
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But that's okay, because you can also feel like this.

751
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Hey, Adam, there's a parent from a green pod.

752
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm feeling that the awakening.

753
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Let's do it.

754
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Let's get all over it.

755
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Okay, I think there's a new media revolution awake in the people.

756
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And we're in a circle.

757
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And the time when we're all alone.

758
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And the time when the shine goes to the sun.

759
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

760
00:31:44,000 --> 00:32:14,000
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh I, oh, oh, oh, on, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh,

761
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
We're not falling over right,

762
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
We're the leaders here,

763
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,140
Fromalu to the whole of your world,

764
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,260
Where have you my happiness?

765
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,940
Stránd fountain is a bad one.

766
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,580
I am free, you're hiding,

767
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,160
Don't I die by your side,

768
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,740
Just like yesterday,

769
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,980
You're my fundamental warrior.

770
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,000
We don't forget, oh, now we're going in

771
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Now, now, now, now, now

772
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
We're going in

773
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I hope we live

774
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Of whom I end the love every single other

775
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Make me at the limit, give me a medal

776
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
My heart feel hot, pull me loose my heart

777
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And just toss it over and be with you when it's time

778
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
It's time to fly

779
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Say my love

780
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:40,000
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

781
00:34:40,000 --> 00:35:10,000
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

782
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Yeah, oh, you know the world that she for a reason don't you?

783
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You can probably relate now.

784
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Now you listen to it.

785
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
We'll be full again.

786
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Brought to you by Van Halen on daily source code.

787
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Episode number 7 7 7.

788
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Oh man.

789
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Fantastic track.

790
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
That is.

791
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,100
Hey, got a lot more calls to get through today on today's episode, including from a fellow

792
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,000
chucklehead sales guy, you.

793
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Hello there, Adam.

794
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Sales guy, you've determined he's been a long time.

795
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Amazing thing happened today.

796
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'd rise up to the gas station to fill the car up with diesel.

797
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Diesel right now.

798
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You're a 50-meter.

799
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
That's what it calls to.

800
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So I've filled up the gas station lot of money and I'm aggravated about it.

801
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I walk in to the gas register.

802
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
You know, give the guy my credit card.

803
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You know, it's about bitchening complaining to him.

804
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah, as one does.

805
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Just morning.

806
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You know, I'm Dutch.

807
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So with a morning complaining.

808
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah, true.

809
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You know, the Dutch are like, right?

810
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yeah.

811
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Behind me, there are still a few other people waiting.

812
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
One guy starts bitchening.

813
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
He also starts complaining.

814
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Well, it's ridiculous.

815
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
It's way overpriced.

816
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Stupid.

817
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You know, I'm going to try to get my bike and go to work with it.

818
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I don't want to drive my car anymore.

819
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I start feeling really bad for the guy behind the register.

820
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It's nothing you can do about it, right?

821
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You know what he did?

822
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
He asked me to say, hey, people, nothing I can do about it.

823
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And they will go up more.

824
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And we just received words from corporate adolescents that we have to increase pricing.

825
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So basically, over the next couple of weeks.

826
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And you know, for us all free ice creams to make up for the rising gas prices.

827
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You know what?

828
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I kind of sell for it.

829
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So here's a tip tool that the gas station is out there.

830
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Also free ice cream.

831
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
People of it.

832
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
We're losing day work for us.

833
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Ice cream.

834
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Time's the correct.

835
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Oh, boy.

836
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Five times.

837
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Nah, ice cream.

838
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It makes you feel good when your tank costs too much to fill up.

839
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
You know, that's kind of interesting.

840
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You say that sales guy, you because here in the UK,

841
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
we now have a minor price war going on.

842
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Now that the price of oil has dropped by $20 since we checked the last.

843
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Let me just see how we're doing right now.

844
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Hold on.

845
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Let's see.

846
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Last time we checked it was 12622 actual retail price.

847
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Now of 12671.

848
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Okay.

849
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So when I'm just a little bit.

850
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But it still means down 20 bucks from, you know, less than a week ago.

851
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
That's just pretty amazing when you think about it.

852
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So in the UK, there's a little bit of a price war going on amongst the.

853
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
The grocery store stores here like Asda and Tesco.

854
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
They usually have a gas station on premises.

855
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And so they're not lowering by five to six pence a liter.

856
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Excuse me.

857
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So, well, they're calling it a price war.

858
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But they should really be dropping into quite a bit.

859
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And, you know, I'm talking like significant penses.

860
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
If the price now stays down this low.

861
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And you should see that same happening all across the world.

862
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
If not, well, that would be a big flag right there.

863
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
But I'm thinking something else personally.

864
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Now think about the timing of all this.

865
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So everyone's pretty much on vacation now.

866
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Or a lot of the West is on vacation.

867
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
By the way, all of your tickets, all your travel.

868
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It was all booked on the high oil prices.

869
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Now, if the theory is correct.

870
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And I'm talking about multiple theories here.

871
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
But kind of the one I'm shaping in my head.

872
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But it certainly includes the most recent book I read on vacation.

873
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Shocked doctrine by Naomi Klein.

874
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
If the shock theory holds true, then basically we were shocked.

875
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Right?

876
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So we were, in fact, you read it everywhere in the newspapers with the oil shock.

877
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
So we're shocked by 146 dollars of barrel of crude oil.

878
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Now it's dropping down significantly.

879
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Usually, if the theory is correct,

880
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
this is the moment when shit starts to get slid in.

881
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Like the removal of double jeopardy.

882
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And other interesting things.

883
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And that's kind of the way advertising works too.

884
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
First, you got to scare someone into saying,

885
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
let's see, if you don't drink this beer, you'll never get laid.

886
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And then you give them the information.

887
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And make them feel good.

888
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
If you don't use the Zid cream, you'll never get laid.

889
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And then you give them the information.

890
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Isn't that, what does David Ike say?

891
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It's a problem conflict resolution.

892
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So we should be seeing some interesting things happening.

893
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And I want all chuckle heads to be on high alert now.

894
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Because now is the not the time to kick back and say,

895
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
oh, finally, you know, things are getting better.

896
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

897
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
If the theory is correct, we'll test this within the next six weeks.

898
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
We're going to see something happen.

899
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Something will change.

900
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Some walls will be introduced.

901
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
We may even have a double whammy.

902
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Have another to shock it us.

903
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And I got to thought about that, which we'll talk about in a little bit.

904
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yeah, I got plenty of thoughts these days.

905
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
This one, this two, contact contact.

906
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Contact.

907
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah, the movie with Joey Foster was coming.

908
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Contact.

909
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
That's what I was talking about there.

910
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
This is going back to 775.

911
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
A lot of people misconstrued me explaining the new brew theory with,

912
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
with me believing in all of it.

913
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm not saying I don't.

914
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But I'm certainly not saying I do entirely.

915
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Yeah.

916
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So I'm not, well, here we go.

917
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Thanks.

918
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
You're talking about a UFO.

919
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Yes.

920
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
You're talking about here, calling from sunny Southern Germany about 775.

921
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Good job.

922
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Adam, you're a little concerned.

923
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I've been with you since 2004.

924
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Yeah, we've been together a long time, my friend.

925
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Uh, we've been through red tills and rabbit holes and scrunching and folding.

926
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:08,000
We've been through banks and teagulls and now different types of looking at oil,

927
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
eating oil, eating babies, you name it.

928
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I've been on board.

929
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'm on the bus taking the red tills, drinking the coolade.

930
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
But UFOs.

931
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Yeah.

932
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Me, the wacky weed is providing you with a little too much research room up there

933
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
in the old nagging.

934
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Yeah, that would be the desired effect, Chris.

935
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Anyhow, it's funny.

936
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I just saw Indiana Jones, the latest movie wasn't that great.

937
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And then two are exploding the whole UFOs thing.

938
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And, uh, don't even have a query.

939
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Anyways, good luck on your walkabout out there in research land in the Controversial

940
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
City world.

941
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm still in board.

942
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
But definitely looking for the escape exits in case anyone moment.

943
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
The ejectum.

944
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
You're wacky weed gets a little too strong.

945
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Uh, wish you well.

946
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Nice air.

947
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Hope you win.

948
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
They win for us.

949
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
They work for us.

950
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Hell yeah.

951
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And, uh, cheers.

952
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
No, man.

953
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I'm not wacky.

954
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I'm just a free thinker.

955
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Um.

956
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Actually, Johnson and Warwick had a theory about that on the most recent no agenda.

957
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I think, uh, so number 39.

958
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Check it out no agenda.neveo.com.

959
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
He said, he thought that this could easily be.

960
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And, and his theory's not bad, by the way.

961
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
This could easily be a whole PR campaign for a movie.

962
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
These UFOs.

963
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
CNN, Larry Kings, been on it all week for two weeks now almost.

964
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Um, of course, we just had, uh, so we had Indiana Jones.

965
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Uh, we had the expiles coming out.

966
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
So it could also easily be that this is being propagated right now.

967
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Although, if you think about all the sightings, including the Yorkshire police.

968
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I believe it was the Yorkshire police.

969
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Um, I don't know.

970
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Maybe it feeds off of each other.

971
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I don't know.

972
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
But at the end of the day, my friend.

973
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Look around you.

974
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And I don't mean in front of you.

975
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Look up and tell me that in all that space.

976
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
They're in room for some other people.

977
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Hey, I don't know if this is in here.

978
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
No.

979
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
First time call us.

980
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I know.

981
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
With our whole word for the new D and the SC.

982
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Okay.

983
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And that word is demonstrative.

984
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Uh-huh.

985
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
All right.

986
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Just a quick look on the, uh, dictionary.com.

987
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And, uh, definition for you serving two demonstrates.

988
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Extraordinary three.

989
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Or it is translated three.

990
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
You are demonstrative.

991
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Your survival.

992
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Our demonstrative.

993
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Is showing us how to live on my.

994
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
That's, yeah.

995
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So, uh, that's my little contribution.

996
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And, uh, I hope that helps.

997
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Yeah.

998
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I appreciate it.

999
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Uh, just one of the many comments.

1000
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I told you earlier of people, uh, looking to help me replace the daily and daily source code since it just ain't going to be that way.

1001
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And for a number of reasons, not just because of, uh, my, my real jobs.

1002
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Uh-huh.

1003
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Uh, but also because of, um, you know, it takes time to produce.

1004
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
It's really just a time factor.

1005
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And, and not just a time of, I got to think about stuff too.

1006
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You know, I just don't, I got to have the time to think and digest and do research.

1007
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And every single waking hour is taken out by this show.

1008
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Every, every other piece, every minute, every second that, uh, that I'm not doing something else.

1009
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I'm doing this.

1010
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
But demonstrative, uh, it doesn't quite roll off the tongue very well.

1011
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Does it?

1012
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Adam, this is a little from Westport again.

1013
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Um, I get cut off.

1014
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I think it out with ECS4.

1015
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
ECS4 disinformation.

1016
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Okay.

1017
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Okay.

1018
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
The back.

1019
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I'm Paul is not a senator.

1020
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
He's a congressman.

1021
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Yeah. That's just a mistake.

1022
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Okay.

1023
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Uh, you can call the disinformation, but that implies that I'm trying to say something that is incorrect on purpose.

1024
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So, me, a culpa.

1025
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
The congressman from Texas, he does not get on the floor of the Senate and apply not any topic.

1026
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Right.

1027
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
But did you hear what he said?

1028
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I think it was the actual content of his message that I played on the show that was important.

1029
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
So, sorry about that.

1030
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
He gets on the floor of the house.

1031
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Yeah.

1032
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Get edition.

1033
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,000
The fact that Iran is even talking about flirting the market with, uh, low parties or

1034
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
a denomulating in euros.

1035
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Frankly, is a canard because there's an exchange rate that is a canard as in a duck.

1036
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
It floats between the dollar and the euros.

1037
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And as a result, the price will reach equilibrium regardless of what the currency is.

1038
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Oh, my friend.

1039
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Oh, you're missing the point there.

1040
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
No, no, no.

1041
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
If they start selling their oil in euros, I said trading.

1042
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
But if they start selling it in euros, the dollar will be not unnecessary.

1043
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Then all of a sudden, there wasn't going to be looking to unload their dollars and buy euros.

1044
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
You can't tell me that doesn't make sense.

1045
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
That's the problem.

1046
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It's not just the cheapness of it.

1047
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Of course, that's equilibrium.

1048
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
In fact, the equilibrium seems to be unequal on the US side.

1049
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
But yes, there's equilibrium.

1050
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And everything's related.

1051
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
You know, uh, you're the European Central banks.

1052
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
They pop up from 4% to 425 on their interest rate, controlling the market.

1053
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Book dollar has to go up.

1054
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
No way, man.

1055
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Dollar has to go down.

1056
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
But then oil goes down.

1057
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Dollar goes up.

1058
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It's all related.

1059
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It's all, it's all a part of the same system.

1060
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
But it's about the euro price, the pricing and euros.

1061
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
That's what it's about.

1062
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
If people have to buy it with euros, then there's not going to be a need for the dollar.

1063
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
That would kill the dollar.

1064
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
That's the point.

1065
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Because you have to look at all economic transactions in terms of a basket of what different

1066
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
currencies and different commodities trade at against each other.

1067
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
So enjoy your vacation.

1068
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
When they get back one chip, give a call.

1069
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And we can talk about this.

1070
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Um, I have a way to keep operating officer for an investment management firm in New York.

1071
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And I had to do a lot of stuff at 30 some odd years.

1072
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So we can talk.

1073
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
All right.

1074
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And I hope you have a good vacation.

1075
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I'm in.

1076
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Hey, listen, that's cool.

1077
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I really appreciate that.

1078
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
So taking when I just said, would you mind calling back in and tell me if I'm totally nuts?

1079
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Because when you get into baskets and all that stuff, you know, it's like, oh, okay.

1080
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Uh, then all of a sudden, I mean, I'm in CNBC land and my eyes start to glaze over.

1081
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
But I have a suspicious feeling that this is pretty much right.

1082
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
If it's sold in euros, which means other countries who are buying oil, including the United States,

1083
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
will have to get euros.

1084
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So you buy euros.

1085
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
There becomes a supply and demand.

1086
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
You don't need the dollars.

1087
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Just drop them.

1088
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
The dollar drops in price.

1089
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And it's all over.

1090
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
The world worth three.

1091
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
It's arm again.

1092
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Or you could take your hard earned euros and go to e-music.com.

1093
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I actually want to do this endorsement for them after Van Hayland.

1094
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
We won't get fooled again.

1095
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
But I overlooked it.

1096
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So I apologize.

1097
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
You can get 33 songs.

1098
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Free.

1099
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Okay.

1100
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
As in as in free beer.

1101
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
All you got to do is you got to go sign up and get your 30 songs.

1102
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And if you don't like it, if it's not working for you, then just unsubscribe.

1103
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
It's okay.

1104
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I'm out.

1105
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Won't cost you a penny.

1106
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
You keep the 33 MP3s.

1107
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Go to e-music.com slash daily source code for your 33 MP3s.

1108
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
E-music.com slash daily source code.

1109
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Hey, Adam, what's up?

1110
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
What's up?

1111
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
This is Eric from Portland.

1112
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Just going in.

1113
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I saw this link.

1114
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Freak me out, man.

1115
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Faceless people.

1116
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Yeah.

1117
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
We're open.

1118
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Yeah.

1119
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
So that too.

1120
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Yeah.

1121
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Freak?

1122
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yes.

1123
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
They were for us.

1124
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
They sure do.

1125
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah.

1126
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
This is a great campaign.

1127
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
This is the Lotus Car Manufacturing Company.

1128
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And they've got this really, really scary looking kind of like plastic masks that

1129
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
these people put on.

1130
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It's like a buzz marketing campaign.

1131
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And I heard about it.

1132
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And I immediately was thinking,

1133
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
the UFOs aren't sitting there.

1134
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
The aliens aren't there at Wimbledon.

1135
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
But you go to it's facelesspeople.com.

1136
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I think is the website address.

1137
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Pretty cool.

1138
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Yeah.

1139
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
But the campaign is great.

1140
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Hey, Adam.

1141
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Can't pick up on the air.

1142
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Thank you.

1143
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
You know what I'm thinking about the D&DFC.

1144
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And I was thinking, you might want to just make it the Delta source code.

1145
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Delta.

1146
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
That being of course an aviation term.

1147
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And it represents change.

1148
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
That's medically, I guess.

1149
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
And we've managed to change the minds of a lot of people.

1150
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
My self included.

1151
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
And also you've changed your format over the years.

1152
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You haven't been afraid to experiment a little bit.

1153
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So I'm with the Delta source code.

1154
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Thank you.

1155
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Yeah.

1156
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Yeah.

1157
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Tell when's back out to my friend.

1158
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah.

1159
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I don't know.

1160
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I'm thinking maybe the D just stands for whatever you damn well decide.

1161
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Hey, Adam.

1162
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
A gorephobic mic here.

1163
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
A gorephobic mic.

1164
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I was listening to the past few DSCs and no agendas.

1165
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
It appears that you're going down the old camera foil halfway.

1166
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Yeah.

1167
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I know you said it just theories.

1168
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And you know, you're just doing your research.

1169
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,000
But it appears that you aren't really looking at any of the sources that refuse these theories.

1170
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Yeah.

1171
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Go on.

1172
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Hold on a second.

1173
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yeah.

1174
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I am looking at the sources that refuse the theories.

1175
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I look at them all the time.

1176
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Are you kidding me?

1177
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I don't report on them.

1178
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
You know, I come up with what I think is the story.

1179
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Yeah.

1180
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And I'm out of journalism.

1181
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I'm a disc jockey.

1182
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I'm a VJ.

1183
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
That's the lowest drug on the show business ladder.

1184
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
So, you know, I'm just a guy who's just passing on what he thinks is right.

1185
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I'm doing my own translation.

1186
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I'm aggregating information.

1187
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And people send me lots of stuff.

1188
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I have to say though, most of the stuff that is the anti conspiracy stuff.

1189
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
It's just not as entertaining.

1190
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So I have a humble request.

1191
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Try to spend equal notes of code.

1192
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I'm not going to spend equal notes.

1193
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Because there's not equal amounts of anti conspiracy stuff out there.

1194
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
It's all the conspiracy stuff.

1195
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I'd be looking forever and coming up with no results.

1196
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I'm on pro and anti conspiracy website.

1197
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I'll just even, you know, quarter of the time looking at what the skeptics have to say.

1198
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And I'll be happy.

1199
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I'm just asking you to apply a little reason and critical thinking to, you know, determine the validity of the series.

1200
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I suggest skeptic.com, skeptoid.com, you know, quackwatch.org, skeptic dictionary stuff like that.

1201
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:36,000
These guys use logic and critical thinking to find a supported conclusion.

1202
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Not the justification of a preconceived conclusion.

1203
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
And that's, I think, is the real bread pill.

1204
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
So give it that a shot.

1205
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Okay.

1206
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Well, they work for us.

1207
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Yeah, they do.

1208
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
All right.

1209
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
But, you know, I don't know much about you, my friend.

1210
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
So you got to tell us a bit more.

1211
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
You got to point us to some actual stories.

1212
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
You know, don't just say you should be looking at both sides of the story.

1213
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Because that's like knock talk, okay.

1214
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
That's Mr. Smith talking.

1215
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Does it show me some?

1216
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And by the way, those anti conspiracy sites, they don't have any cool videos.

1217
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
That's not your bummer.

1218
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Yeah, that's just words.

1219
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Show me some videos.

1220
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Show me something that is proof of the 21st century, like edited video.

1221
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I love that.

1222
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
That's the real truth.

1223
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
But, you know, point to some mainstream stories.

1224
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Don't just give me some scientific evidence.

1225
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Point to other reporting.

1226
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
That's what I'm liking so much about this stuff.

1227
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Is it a pointing out reporting from mainstream news media?

1228
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Remashing that into a story, which, hell, you know, it's certainly better than

1229
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
veging out and zoning out to desperate house wise.

1230
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Hey, Adam.

1231
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Yeah.

1232
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
The monetary scientist.

1233
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Actually, I'll get to the monetary scientist in a moment.

1234
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I wanted to say that I had looked at a couple other conspiracies.

1235
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
And actually, not so much conspiracies.

1236
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
But, uh, refute this for me.

1237
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
The codex elementarious.

1238
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I'm just going to run through a couple things because I think they're going to start heating up.

1239
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And it's going to be really important to look at these.

1240
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
The codex elementarious is literally the food law.

1241
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
We've talked about it before.

1242
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:14,000
And I found, uh, was this Health FreedomUSA.org, which you're probably familiar with, has actually

1243
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
the summarized, some of the codex elementarious summarized in seven points.

1244
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And, uh, to the points are starting to 62 by the UN imposed by World Trade Organization sanctions.

1245
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Uh, number two, nutrients are toxins is junk science.

1246
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Number three, not consumer protection.

1247
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
That's propaganda.

1248
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Number four, codex, serious threat to health and health freedom.

1249
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And, uh, five serves economic interests of sickness industries through the World Trade Organization and

1250
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Napoleonic Code.

1251
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
This is a big one because it's the pharmaceutical companies who I believe are a part of the big,

1252
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
big problem.

1253
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
We got going on or the one that's coming.

1254
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Uh, all the way down number seven, your action is needed now.

1255
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
So I'll put a link in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

1256
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I want you to take a look at that because there's no way I can explain exactly what this is other than,

1257
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,000
uh, the government of the world wants to determine what you put in your body and what you eat.

1258
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
By literally outlying certain types of food, certain types of nutrients.

1259
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Uh, they've already done it with tomatoes.

1260
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
We talked about it, uh, with tomatoes.

1261
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Now there's a code for what a tomato can look like.

1262
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
What it's, you know, the four kinds of a tomato.

1263
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
And now they're going to do that with the, what is it now?

1264
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
There's a new health care with the jalapeno peppers that have made, you know, one jalapeno pepper,

1265
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
made 1200 people sick and, uh, it's so it's just done there from the same.

1266
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I think it was Mexico again.

1267
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Uh, which is probably in American corporation.

1268
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Um, and now another form of, uh, what is it, uh,

1269
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
you know, the chicken stuff, Salmanella, Salmanella.

1270
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Now, the first on tomatoes, now Salmanella found on jalapeno peppers.

1271
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
You know, this could be part of a shock, but all I know is that, you know,

1272
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
we had that big scare with the tomatoes in the US,

1273
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
not even putting them on our, on our American hamburgers.

1274
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And also, and there's rules about what a tomato can look like.

1275
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Uh, I'm just saying.

1276
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Uh, let me see what else that I have.

1277
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Oh, yeah, talking about the big, uh,

1278
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
the big pharmaceuticals.

1279
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Here's a cool one.

1280
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Have you heard about this yet?

1281
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
The New York Times reports that the American Academy of Pediatrics

1282
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
has issued new guidelines this week to, quote,

1283
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
aggressively screen and Medicaid for high cholesterol in children.

1284
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Yeah, now you're talking.

1285
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Let's not, let's not, let's not, uh,

1286
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
try and feed our kids healthy food.

1287
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Let's, uh, feed them crap and put them on cholesterol, uh,

1288
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
medicine statements.

1289
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Uh, boy.

1290
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Do some research on this and please whatever you do.

1291
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Don't put your kids on cholesterol medicine.

1292
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
That's nuts.

1293
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It's absolutely nuts.

1294
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
You got to feed them healthy food and healthy food.

1295
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I'm pretty much convinced.

1296
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Doesn't come from the grocery store anymore.

1297
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And then my favorite.

1298
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
This is my absolute favorite in the past two weeks.

1299
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Not one but two companies.

1300
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Um, in San Diego and the other one.

1301
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I'm, I know West Coast.

1302
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Have claimed that they have an effective

1303
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
vaccine against the dreaded avian flu.

1304
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
H five and one bird flu virus, which, of course,

1305
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
will be the root of the pandemic.

1306
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Which is going to kill us all.

1307
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
We've been, this has been building for a number of years.

1308
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Now we've had SARS and, you know,

1309
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
and of course, it's all based on,

1310
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
and you really need to look this one up.

1311
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Uh, it's based on, um,

1312
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
what happened in 19.

1313
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Uh, was it 18, I believe?

1314
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Uh, no, 19 13.

1315
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Just before a world war one, um,

1316
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
they sent, uh,

1317
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
American soldiers over to Europe and they

1318
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
inoculated them.

1319
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And, uh, when those guys got over there,

1320
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
they said they had a virus in their, uh, in their body.

1321
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
And by the way, uh,

1322
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
uh, the anti-dote for virus is actually part of the virus.

1323
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
You got to have the virus, you know,

1324
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
you've seen that in movies, right?

1325
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
You've got to have the virus or patient zero's, uh,

1326
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
DNA in order to create the antidote.

1327
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
So, first of all,

1328
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
there's two companies who say they've got the,

1329
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
an enoculation for this means that they've created

1330
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
the human to human version of avian bird flu.

1331
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
That's the only way I can look at it, you know,

1332
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
from my limited scientific knowledge.

1333
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
So, um, if you've never heard of the Spanish flu,

1334
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
this is what happened in, uh, in the early 1900s.

1335
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
So, they sent all these GIs over there.

1336
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Now, when you have this, when you have a virus in your body,

1337
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
you know, you've got a lot of viruses.

1338
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
It doesn't actually activate unless A,

1339
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
you're in reasonably poor health,

1340
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
like, uh, you're eating shit from the supermarket,

1341
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
and you're full of stress,

1342
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
like, uh, you can't afford to fill up your car.

1343
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
That's when viruses start to, uh,

1344
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
start to live in the body.

1345
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
So, if you were, if these GIs were

1346
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
inoculated with, uh, some horrible virus,

1347
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
and God knows, well, you can look it up

1348
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
there's lots of theories about where they purposely injected

1349
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
with some shit or not.

1350
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
You know, you, you, you put them on some ships,

1351
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
uh, you know, food is probably minimal, uh,

1352
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
in quality.

1353
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Are they stressed?

1354
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Let me think going off to war?

1355
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Yeah, I think they were stressed.

1356
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
So, it was, I think was like 40 million people died

1357
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
of the Spanish flu.

1358
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
40 million people.

1359
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And these statistics can be found in large

1360
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
pharmaceuticals and you'll reports

1361
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
with their product pipeline saying, hey, you know,

1362
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
we're getting some shit ready for the A,

1363
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
and flu, of course, you've heard of Tamiflu,

1364
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
which, uh, is now no longer considered to be valid

1365
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
for this horrible strain of the H5 and 1 virus.

1366
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
But these two other companies,

1367
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
this is like $100 million on order

1368
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
by the US government.

1369
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
They've reserved $3.9 billion to stockpile

1370
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
a vaccine for a disease,

1371
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
which does not exist as far as we know,

1372
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
unless, of course, they've built it in the lab,

1373
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
which so far is only in 10 years,

1374
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
is only killed 200 people.

1375
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And you have 100,000 percent,

1376
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
100,000 times more chance of being struck

1377
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
by lightning in your bed.

1378
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
So, what is up with this?

1379
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Is it possible, maybe,

1380
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
that now that the lever has been pulled back

1381
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
on oil that we're going to get scared by something else,

1382
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
maybe terror doesn't do it for us anymore?

1383
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Is that possible?

1384
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Maybe, um, it's time to, uh,

1385
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
bring that back into the fold.

1386
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Two things I'd like to say.

1387
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Keep your eyes open, keep your ears open,

1388
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
and don't let anyone stick a needle in you.

1389
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Or any reason.

1390
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Hey, Adam, this is the monetary scientist.

1391
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Um, Jason didn't hear indie Mac,

1392
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
the second largest bank failure ever in US history,

1393
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
has been on Friday.

1394
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Yeah, it's not like we haven't talked about this,

1395
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
that, uh, you know,

1396
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
when, when, when, when they,

1397
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
when the financial sector was saying,

1398
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
oh, you know, we're getting over this,

1399
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
you know, we were talking about maybe

1400
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
second or third inning.

1401
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And I think we're not even half way there yet.

1402
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
And so I bet a lot of the DSC listeners

1403
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
are wondering, you know,

1404
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
is my money safe in various banks or whatnot.

1405
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Yeah, let me, uh,

1406
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
let me just, for people who may be new to this conversation.

1407
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Um, so this is really almost

1408
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
at the bottom floor of the entire credit crisis.

1409
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So here you have two companies,

1410
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Freddie May, Freddie Mac,

1411
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
and he may Freddie, Freddie, Freddie,

1412
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
and he may Freddie,

1413
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Freddie May, John Boy and Mary Ellen.

1414
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
And, um, they, uh, these are banks,

1415
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
commercial banks.

1416
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And they hold about six,

1417
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
trillion dollars worth of mortgages,

1418
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
which, of course, are to being defaulted on,

1419
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
and, you know, people can't afford it anymore.

1420
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And, and they also, you know, took that debt,

1421
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
and they, they've traded on it.

1422
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
They've barred against it.

1423
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
They, they, with that as collateral.

1424
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
That's basically how the banking system works

1425
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
by the way.

1426
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
It's, it's always pretend money.

1427
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
You know, just because you have, uh,

1428
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
like if you have a million dollars in the bank,

1429
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
you're allowed to lend out nine more million dollars.

1430
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
That's money that never existed.

1431
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
You just created it because you got a million in the bank.

1432
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
That's the way it works.

1433
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
That's what reserve banking is.

1434
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
That's the law.

1435
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
That's how it was all set up.

1436
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
That's how we get ripped off.

1437
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And so these guys look ready to fail.

1438
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
But of course, they've always been very sturdy players

1439
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
because it has been implicit.

1440
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
This is the word that they're using.

1441
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It's code implicit that the US government would always stand behind them

1442
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
and that these are institutions that are,

1443
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
quote, too big to fail.

1444
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
So that means they won't fail because America will just,

1445
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
well, you know, it's like printing money,

1446
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
but it isn't really.

1447
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It's just putting out the zero behind this elementary and the spreadsheet.

1448
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
But of course, that will devalue the dollar and cause a whole

1449
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
another economic shift.

1450
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
So that's what's going on right now.

1451
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Anyways, the F-E-I-C has about 52 billion in assets.

1452
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And Indy Mac is estimated to cost between six hundred billion

1453
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
of that 52 billion.

1454
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Right.

1455
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
So let me just explain that.

1456
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
So this is the guarantee that if you deposit money into the bank

1457
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
that to a certain amount, which is different.

1458
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Not quite sure.

1459
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Is it now 100 grand in the states?

1460
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I think it's been up to 35,000 pounds in the UK.

1461
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And I don't know if that's per account or if that's just per depositor.

1462
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
So, you know, because if there's a run on the bank or the bank fails,

1463
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
you know, you don't want everyone's money to be gone.

1464
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Another thing that is insured by the government.

1465
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
So they've got 56 billion, okay?

1466
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So F-E-I-C insurance, I don't know if I can count on it.

1467
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
If I were anyone.

1468
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
And a couple of banks that look like they might be having some trouble.

1469
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And I've actually written about, remember, before our Wacobia and

1470
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Washington Mutual.

1471
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,000
So, you know, just make sure that your cash is safe and run to gold.com.

1472
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Anyways, I've bought about a lot of these issues there lately.

1473
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
And some of the latest articles I think would be good reach for people.

1474
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Especially like the snow sticks.

1475
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
That's a good one.

1476
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Anyways, I hope all the BSC listeners are safe with their money.

1477
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Keep up the good work.

1478
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
We'll be your hair.

1479
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Great job.

1480
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Now that's us.

1481
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Yep.

1482
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Excuse me.

1483
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Run to gold.com.

1484
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Some good advice over there.

1485
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I have not bought into gold myself, but I have put everything into euros.

1486
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
And I guess I'm considering filling up the ice box with some cash.

1487
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I don't know.

1488
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I'm not really seeing an impending doom, but it is for real.

1489
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
These failures are for real.

1490
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And if the FDIC only has 56 billion to guarantee these banks.

1491
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
You got the May and the Max.

1492
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
And they could fail for trillions.

1493
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Yeah, we're not going to have enough money.

1494
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Of course, we can just print it up.

1495
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
But that, of course, is a bad idea.

1496
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
That's why they're put some European stuff.

1497
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Hey, Adam and Michael, listen up from Germany.

1498
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I have a lead for you, which when you might be interested in.

1499
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I just found this guy on YouTube.

1500
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
His name is Nigel Ferrage.

1501
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Yeah.

1502
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
He's the last name he's pronounced.

1503
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
He's an MEP, a member of the European Parliament.

1504
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
And he's very outspoken about European issues.

1505
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And go check him out.

1506
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
And maybe if you happen to be in the yet.

1507
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Maybe you should.

1508
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I think he's a like guy for the program.

1509
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Thank you.

1510
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Yeah, you know, it's funny.

1511
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Because I've seen his videos on YouTube.

1512
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
You can just go to YouTube or do Google video search for Farage.

1513
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
F-A-R-A-G-E-F-X-T-L-F-R-O-R-O-M-O-L-F-G-O.

1514
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
And you'll see this guy talking some real straight talk

1515
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
in European Parliament.

1516
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Now, in the UK, though, people are like against the guy.

1517
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Like, you know, it's from the independent party.

1518
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And then, and not quite sure, I don't have a handle

1519
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
on the vibe of the UK political landscape yet.

1520
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
But whenever I say, hey, I've said to people at the office here.

1521
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I said, yeah, this guy's pretty interesting.

1522
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Oh, yeah, but he's a UKIP.

1523
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1524
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
It sounds like he's making a lot of sense to me.

1525
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Particularly when it comes to the Lisbon Treaty,

1526
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
which I will say once again,

1527
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
do not let this get jammed down our throats.

1528
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
No is no.

1529
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And they work for us.

1530
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
So you've got 27 European members of Parliament

1531
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
in each of your, in your countries.

1532
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Right to them.

1533
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Tell them that you want to respect the Irish vote.

1534
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Respect it.

1535
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And if there's no Lisbon Treaty, then it just remains

1536
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
as that as quo as the Treaty of Nice.

1537
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Which is nice.

1538
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
And just keep it rolling.

1539
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Leave it at that.

1540
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Respect the Irish vote.

1541
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Please.

1542
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Famous middle-aged, rock-and-roller called me last week

1543
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
to thank me for speaking out against the war.

1544
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Only to go on to tell me that he could not speak himself

1545
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
because he fears repercussions.

1546
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
If you oppose this administration,

1547
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
their can and will be remediation of the picture.

1548
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And the picture of the picture of the picture.

1549
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
By the name of the world Abundance and the definition of the word.

1550
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
By the name of viewers of the world Abundance and the community of the world,

1551
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
��고 tennis-and the toughest life for women.

1552
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I choose to beat everyone.

1553
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
But I miserable.

1554
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I understand the complexity of freedom of women.

1555
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
But life is notbilir in a reputation

1556
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
as Marx and the political PM-Ran,

1557
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
no more tires.

1558
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I'm allowing women to play rugby.

1559
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I'm awaiting that.

1560
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Finally, we are again.

1561
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
We've played on some dances.

1562
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
And today is the first time I watched swan.

1563
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
And I'm going to show her the interests of both the women.

1564
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
There should be no more leads.

1565
01:06:47,000 --> 01:07:17,000
So, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what

1566
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do. What do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, like do I do, like do, like I do I do, like do, like do I do I do, like do I do, like I do, like do me, like, do I do, like do I do, what do I do, like do I do I do, like do I do do I do, like do I do, like do I do, like do I do,

1567
01:07:47,000 --> 01:08:03,380
And then justansa

1568
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,800
I remember

1569
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:09,500
The world filled with

1570
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:14,500
I'm watching so quickly in one shot for no

1571
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:19,500
I'm watching so quickly in one shot for no

1572
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:24,500
Someone watching TV is watching so far

1573
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:29,500
Someone watching so quickly in one shot for no

1574
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:44,500
Someone watching so quickly in one shot for no

1575
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:49,500
Someone watching the TV is watching so far

1576
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:54,500
Someone watching the TV is watching so far

1577
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:59,500
Someone watching the TV is watching so far

1578
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:04,500
Someone watching the TV is watching so far

1579
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:20,800
CHARACTERS

1580
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:32,800
There's no good things to play me

1581
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:37,800
What's wrong with you & what's off and running

1582
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:42,800
What is the forbidden walls?

1583
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,800
What is the forbidden wall?

1584
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:50,800
But once I know you make it, once it's a hell.

1585
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:10,800
I like the way, the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it is.

1586
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:46,800
The way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it

1587
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:53,000
was the couple days away.... I can't resist. I love that track how cool is that. Alone everybody we're at a

1588
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:00,160
Oh, man. Long show today. But oh yeah our in 10 minutes, we're all righty, gonna leave it at that which means

1589
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:04,860
probably after all the preparations that'll have to do after this one, with all the comments,

1590
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:11,320
everything coming in will be all set for a football Friday. Then again, you never know, do you?

1591
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:15,620
So so until we meet again, live your life with passion and while in last,

1592
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:17,620
Enjoy your freedom.

1593
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:21,620
Another fine, medial presentation, stick it in your ear.
