1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Shared Charlie, eight one two.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's the financial rescue bill, fails in Congress yet again.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The value of your home could plummet.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Families looking for a new home will be unable to get a loan.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's going to be harder for you to get a mortgage for your home.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
New car sales will come to a halt.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Or the loans you need to buy a car.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It would be more difficult for you to get the loans you need to buy a car.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Or send your children to the college.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
No longer be able to get loans for college.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What businesses would close their doors may be unable to pay employees.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Thousands of businesses could call.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In millions of Americans could lose their job.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Millions of jobs could be lost.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We failed to act.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And ultimately, our country could experience a long and painful recession.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We're 60 million dollars worth of airplanes trapped by us.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
To the next generation, we need to count any of my ears.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I guess it's a new curry.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

I like to think I'm flying into the future.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I like to think that I'm flying into the future.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We're shrieks for which you are

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm getting out with each other's mail

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're heading around

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You get from out

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That doesn't help you

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You're the better man

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The crazy's on you

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's not me

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So what do you do

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That can't be

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hey you, you're the best now

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah, I told you

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Just me for myself

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm counting on you

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Let me hold you

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's not me

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So you're the better man

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000

Let me hold you

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's not me

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So you're the better man

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The crazy's on you

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let me hold you

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:51,000

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,080
G-town probably the last time we'll be doing the show from this location.

70
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,720
In fact, I'm 100% sure of it.

71
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,640
This will be the last show before Christmas.

72
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,880
It is the 23rd of December 2008, Merry Christmas.

73
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,120
Or as we say in the United Kingdom, happy Christmas.

74
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,320
Happy Hanukkah.

75
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,640
Happy Quanza.

76
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,640
Happy Winter Solstice.

77
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,520
Anything you celebrate as long as you're hanging out

78
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,040
with your family for the next couple of days.

79
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,840
Enjoy it.

80
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,440
So yeah, between the move, which has been,

81
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,040
this is actually, I don't know if I really like this process

82
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,480
of having the house for a month

83
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,880
and then slowly bring in stuff over

84
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,680
because you've also made some adjustments

85
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,960
and not want to change this floor

86
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,760
and all kinds of stuff going on between that and my job,

87
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,400
which these days consists pretty much of creating

88
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,320
the Mivio today, four minute video show,

89
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,600
which runs when you hit Mivio.com,

90
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,280
it gives you an overview of what's playing across the four networks,

91
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,640
which I do in its entirety, all of myself.

92
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,320
It's kind of, it's like master-batory almost.

93
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,840
It's really weird.

94
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,920
You know, because I got the camera set up,

95
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,840
got the light set up, got the blue screen set up,

96
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,280
I make sure I'm positioned, I got a white balance

97
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,920
and focus myself, record everything.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,320
I would much, much rather,

99
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,320
actually be doing some kind of master-batory function.

100
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,560
And then, of course, I edited it together.

101
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,360
It takes a long time, man, to do four to five minutes a day.

102
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,480
Crap, Ola.

103
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,120
Then, of course, I, as you know,

104
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't want to just rush through it Charlie,

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,240
so I spent a couple hours preparing.

106
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,920
Actually, I've been saving links throughout the week

107
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,600
as usual so much happening,

108
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,960
but I'll never get to every single bit of it.

109
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,920
And also, I don't want to go to two negative,

110
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,520
and during these happy times,

111
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
we were all getting together.

112
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,000
We really should just be getting together

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,600
with our families, just to get together

114
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,920
with our families, and I forget about gift-giving.

115
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,760
It makes not make a card, but that'll be sufficient.

116
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,720
Get into the habit of it, because money talks,

117
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,400
and money is changing right before our very eyes.

118
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,800
A lot of weird links popped up in the source code

119
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,920
drop over the past week, drop.io slash daily source code.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
I just want to share a couple of them with you

121
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,240
as we get into the, the meat of what's happening in the world.

122
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
Of course, there are no secrets only information

123
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,120
you don't yet have.

124
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,080
A lot of that information is on drop.io slash daily source code,

125
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,880
mainstream news articles, stuff that you just had never heard of,

126
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,800
but was reported on, but because we're so inundated

127
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,360
with information at this absolutely no way

128
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,840
that it can bubble to the top with one or two stories.

129
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,160
This is from a new vision, which builds itself

130
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,680
as Uganda's leading website.

131
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,520
And it's just a weird link that I think is worth discussing.

132
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,520
All boys and men in Uganda will be mobilized

133
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,400
for free circumcision, beginning next year.

134
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,680
This is according to the Commissioner

135
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,040
for the Assistant Commissioner for National Disease Control,

136
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,640
in Uganda, the government plans to introduce

137
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,240
free mass circumcision before the end of 2009

138
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,120
and get this as one of the ways to reduce the spread

139
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,920
of HIV AIDS.

140
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,600
Now this, this is obviously it caught my eye.

141
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
And there's some facts in here.

142
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,280
75% of Uganda and men are not circumcised

143
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,360
according to the 2006 National Zero Survey.

144
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,160
But here it comes.

145
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:03,040
They expect 50% less AIDS contracted by men

146
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,920
if they're circumcised.

147
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,760
That is HIV from women to men.

148
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,960
And I've never heard of this.

149
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,960
But apparently, let me see if I can get the exact part.

150
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,360
The World Health Organization, who I must say,

151
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,320
I kind of distrust, estimated that implementation

152
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,680
of mass circumcision could have hurt up to 5.7 million HIV

153
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,680
infections and 3 million AIDS death worldwide by 2026.

154
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,120
Based on that, World Health Organization

155
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,440
and you need, I guess, that's a UN body charge

156
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,960
with HIV matters, issued a set of recommendations last year

157
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,400
for the use of medical male circumcision,

158
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,600
circumcision, HIV prevention efforts.

159
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,680
This is interesting.

160
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,400
But apparently, the foreskin is,

161
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,920
I'm looking for the, let me just search.

162
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,440
Ah, Safari is so good at that for me.

163
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,520
Four skin.

164
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,040
There we go.

165
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,560
The foreskin is vulnerable to tears and ulcers.

166
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,640
Oh, this is not a happy Christmas story.

167
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,720
That provide an entry point for HIV.

168
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,080
The inner skin is very soft and allows HIV

169
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,360
to easily penetrate.

170
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,240
When this is cut off, the tip of the penis hardens

171
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,920
making it difficult for HIV to penetrate.

172
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,680
Wow, man.

173
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,680
I'd love to hear some doctors weigh in on this.

174
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,600
They really believe that 50% less AIDS,

175
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,280
now they're saying sexual transmission,

176
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,720
although 50% reduction from transmission from women

177
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,320
to men, which I thought was pretty low anyway.

178
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,680
But just in general, it seems like a pretty drastic move.

179
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,600
Nothing I would have to worry myself about

180
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,600
to that spread worldwide since I am circumcised.

181
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,920
Wow, did I just share too much information with you?

182
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,320
Okay, let's move on to something else.

183
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,000
Shall we?

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,680
Hey Adam.

185
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,800
Yeah, it's Wardo.

186
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,640
Can you do it?

187
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,480
In terms of Wonderland's of Seattle.

188
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,240
Yeah, my little friend.

189
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,840
Want to drop you a quick message to give you feedback.

190
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,680
Your comments regarding for my changes to the DSC.

191
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,800
I have been addicted to tank shifting for the past three years.

192
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
First with the dictionary for DVR.

193
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,880
And the last year using a mini with IDV.

194
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,440
Yeah, so I Eduardo, of course, is responding to the fact

195
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,920
that I really desperately want to go live on a very regular basis.

196
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,080
Even if it's shorter, just to get some feedback.

197
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,280
So I'm not living in this vacuum with MP3 feedback in comments.

198
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,600
So I guess he has a problem with connected to my SDTV.

199
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,880
And I have to say that I barely watch any live TV anymore.

200
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,880
There's a lot of people I know that don't watch any television anymore.

201
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,040
They're watching video tons of video, but very little actual television.

202
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,560
And honestly, now that I have the all these swing boxes,

203
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,080
I can watch television on cable in Detroit.

204
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,680
I can watch television on cable television in Hawaii.

205
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,600
You just sat by the channel's man.

206
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
It's all commercial.

207
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,160
It's literally as the boss saying, 57 channels, nothing else.

208
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,160
I can see how a live show will be better for you.

209
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,480
I may improve the content of the DSC.

210
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,080
I will not listen to the show live,

211
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,760
but I will definitely continue to listen to the recordings of the live show.

212
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,160
I would only suggest that you still provide some time in the show for recorded comments.

213
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,800
So we times she's certain droppers can still have a voice in the show.

214
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Of course.

215
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,160
Droppers always welcome here on the Charlie.

216
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,840
By the way, that gear show that you are planning is long overdue,

217
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,600
and I can't wait to watch it.

218
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,960
They work for us.

219
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,800
Elliot?

220
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,680
They may have forgotten, but they sure do.

221
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:58,800
But before I forget, Ray has put together a year-end daily source code

222
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,520
that will blow your socks off.

223
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,160
It is a compilation of a year-worth of episodes,

224
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,200
which used to be a lot, like 200 or something.

225
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,520
Now it's significantly less.

226
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,200
So he didn't have to work that hard.

227
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,080
Now seriously, it took him days

228
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,800
if not weeks to put this thing together.

229
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,040
I'm going to run that just before new years,

230
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,360
between Christmas and New Years,

231
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,640
as I said, you probably won't get another show out of me.

232
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Until 2009, a fresh new show.

233
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,800
And yes, Eduardo, no worries.

234
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,480
Always room for droppers in the show.

235
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,720
Wouldn't want to change a thing.

236
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,440
Some good links and kind of wacky ones,

237
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,000
which of course you couldn't see in the show.

238
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,400
No, it's a daily source code.com.

239
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Crossposts that at curie.com.

240
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,640
This is just something that I picked up.

241
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,840
I think it was, gee, it's so, I think it was several months ago,

242
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,240
maybe even, from Project Camelot.net,

243
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,560
which I don't talk about a lot because of a lot of their stuff

244
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,320
is way out there.

245
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,200
But I do keep up with them.

246
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,600
This is a translated Google page,

247
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,880
or a page translated by Google.

248
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,000
And it talks about, and this is the story,

249
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,440
here's the story in short,

250
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,080
and it's kind of a crude translation,

251
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,360
but worth the read, you'll see the link in there.

252
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,560
That a prominent Norwegian politician has apparently

253
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,600
blown the whistle on this entire underground complex

254
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,880
of tunnels and trains that go with the speed of light

255
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,360
and flash you from one side of the country,

256
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,280
or Lord knows the continent to another,

257
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,720
and that this is where the elite plan to live

258
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,160
with stored food and seeds, apparently.

259
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,440
Bill Gates is mixed up in this,

260
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,440
and there's been a lot of talk about the seed vault.

261
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,920
But this story is, well, you have to read through it,

262
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,320
and you really got to focus,

263
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,040
again, the translation isn't super,

264
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,160
but there's probably another version of it

265
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,200
over a Project Camelot.net.

266
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,120
Again, it's massive tin foil hat time,

267
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,040
but take a look at it, it definitely boads a read.

268
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,160
And just when you thought that you heard everything,

269
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,440
you know, we talked a lot about the government wanting

270
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,240
to chip its citizens, put RFID chips in us,

271
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,720
to track us and eventually be able to control us

272
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,200
through our money or Lord knows,

273
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,120
maybe even implanted in your brain.

274
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,760
Well, now there's an actual reason

275
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,880
to want one of these, or want some form of chip,

276
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,560
because Viagra may soon be history.

277
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,600
Scientists at Oxford University are working

278
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,160
on an electronic sex chip that can stimulate

279
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,680
pleasure centers in the brain.

280
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,600
I think this is how they do it.

281
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,840
They give you something like some fantastic device

282
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,920
that, of course, particularly if it's embedded in near

283
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,160
or in connection with the brain,

284
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,760
could probably do a lot of different things,

285
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,760
maybe not all good, but they give it to you to get a heart on.

286
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,320
It's like, yeah, give me that chip, boy.

287
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
I could use that.

288
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,520
It's a great story, and it comes from the times of India,

289
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,760
which I'll just consider to be mainstream as well.

290
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,160
Something I talked about with the John C. Devorek

291
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,320
on Noah Gendo over the weekend.

292
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,720
The NASA has, well, not just NASA,

293
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
but the number of scientists have discovered

294
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,120
this breach in the Earth's magnetic field.

295
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,200
And it's funny because this is a lot of the stuff

296
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,720
with the north and the south pole and magnetic pole.

297
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,160
A lot of that is prophesized and talked about

298
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,760
in the 2012 circles of people who either believe

299
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,480
that the dawning of the age of Aquarius is coming

300
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,360
and we're all going to be saved,

301
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,000
or exactly the opposite as many compared

302
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,320
to the Book of Revelation,

303
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,560
where the Obama is the antichrist and we're all going to die.

304
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,840
I don't know, but it certainly is a discovery.

305
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,760
And in fact, it's really, I think somewhere in the article

306
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,680
it says it's of tsunami-like proportions

307
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,400
when you, oh, what does this?

308
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,680
Oh, man, I can't do a conference call right now.

309
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
I'm in the middle of my charting.

310
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,000
See, even on our week off,

311
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,160
and, of course, Tom Vilsack announced

312
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,320
as Secretary of Agriculture meeting that Moncanto,

313
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,400
whether they are in the hidden tunnels of Norway

314
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,200
or not in the hills there, near the fjords in Norway,

315
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,080
I think so.

316
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,200
There's certainly going to be in the White House,

317
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,360
Tom Vilsack, who at one point campaigned

318
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,560
using the Moncanto corporate jet Moncanto, of course,

319
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,480
owner of food.

320
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,000
They literally have patents and trademarks

321
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,360
on seeds of a particular corn, mice,

322
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,920
that are genetically modified,

323
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,400
as far as I'm concerned, not healthy for you.

324
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,600
And so this guy is not going to be in charge

325
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,040
of agriculture.

326
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,800
Yeah, that's the change that we were looking for.

327
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,000
And there's some weird story,

328
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,040
which I want you to take a look at about Hillary Clinton

329
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,800
dating to repay him or help him,

330
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,800
recoup the $400,000 he used as a campaign debt

331
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,240
for, I don't know, and maybe he's,

332
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,680
what was he campaigning for?

333
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,360
I don't know, but then he, maybe he was campaigning

334
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,200
for president.

335
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,240
Let me see if it says it here.

336
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,920
Yeah, democratic, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

337
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,600
one time candidate who endorsed him,

338
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,960
I guess he was a one time candidate.

339
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,800
Interesting.

340
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,720
It's all connected, it really is.

341
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,680
And of course, the ongoing story about this IT guy,

342
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,280
doesn't sound very respectful.

343
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,080
Does it, I'm looking for the, here it is, here's the link.

344
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,640
This thing's to high hell, Michael Connell,

345
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,040
if you recall, there was a whole slew of emails

346
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,920
that were held or kept confidential

347
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,360
because they were off the grid, so to speak,

348
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,920
off of the White House grid, 2004.

349
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,440
Actually, this may have even been earlier.

350
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,480
It was a GWB43.com and the emails

351
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,160
between George W. Bush and Carl Rove were,

352
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,080
were supposedly deleted, but, you know,

353
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,960
there's a lot of probably incriminating evidence

354
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,440
containing those emails about a lot of things.

355
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,640
And this guy, Michael Connell, is the guy

356
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,240
who set it up and apparently were supposedly

357
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,320
erased everything, but he was actually, as far as I understand,

358
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,400
there's very little detailed information.

359
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,000
Was flying himself back from Washington, DC,

360
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,360
where a lot of people speculate that he was blowing

361
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,440
the whistle on what actually went down

362
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,960
and what was in those emails, maybe even had copies made

363
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,160
available.

364
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,160
And of course, his single engine plane crashed,

365
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,440
not a shitty plane, by the way, a pipe or serotoga.

366
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,360
I read a report that, oh, he probably hit an ice patch,

367
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,360
which is just about the most unaviation-minded comment

368
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,560
you can make.

369
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,040
This aircraft, by the way, is able to handle ice.

370
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,360
Certainly, if you're more or less on a downwind leg,

371
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,080
as far as I could see from the airfield,

372
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,280
just looking at Google Earth and where the crashed occurred,

373
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,040
versus proximity of the airfield, direction he was coming

374
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,000
from, I didn't get an actual weather report

375
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,640
to see what the icing conditions were.

376
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,760
But I'm even reading a report

377
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,760
that he did not fly his plane two other times

378
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,600
because of tips he got that the plane could have been

379
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
to sabotage.

380
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,680
I mean, it's just a big mess.

381
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,280
The body count goes up by one, nasty.

382
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,680
Oh, let me see.

383
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,360
Well, let's do we have here.

384
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,480
Oh, yeah, this one I liked.

385
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,760
This is, you might have seen this post that on Curie.com.

386
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,760
It's a project called the Global Consciousness Project Dot.

387
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,040
And it's essentially, you can embed this on your,

388
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,200
on a web page anywhere.

389
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,280
And this dot has, what does it's six different color phases,

390
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,720
ranging from blue to kind of like turquoise to green

391
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,040
to, or a yellow to orange to red?

392
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,320
And the history of this thing is there are,

393
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,720
I think it's like 15 or 1600 people globally

394
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,040
who have probes inserted into their brains.

395
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,000
They had some kind of unrelated brain surgery

396
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,920
and agreed to have one of these detectors,

397
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,960
one of these probes inserted into their brain.

398
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,320
There's a whole website about it, a lot of information.

399
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,360
And they, I don't know if it's a real time or if they have to connect

400
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,160
and upload their brain data, but they send it all back to home base.

401
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,960
And based upon that information,

402
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,560
you can see what the global consciousness of these,

403
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,120
you know, the sample group is,

404
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,480
well, not really what they're thinking,

405
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,920
but how what their anxiety level is.

406
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,760
And this boils back to the fact that your brain

407
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,720
actually receives information and dishes it out to your limbs

408
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,720
and to your body with up to a half second

409
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,160
or sometimes even longer delay.

410
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,320
However, your timing isn't off

411
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,520
because it turns out people can actually anticipate

412
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,360
something that is about to happen.

413
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,680
And it's this anticipation, this global consciousness project

414
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,800
is built upon.

415
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,920
So for an example, if someone throws you a ball,

416
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,280
you're even though your brain is sending you signals

417
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,800
and this is scientifically proven,

418
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,840
that take half a second to make your body react,

419
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,320
to catch the ball, as an example.

420
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,680
Your brain is, or something within the human psyche,

421
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:55,320
is anticipating this projectile coming at you.

422
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,720
And therefore moves you and synchronizes you

423
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,320
so that you actually kept the ball on time

424
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,480
and not half a second later.

425
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,960
So what they found is that on up to four hours

426
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,560
before the World Trade Center attack,

427
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,400
the charts went literally off the charts,

428
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,680
that people worldwide could feel some kind of anxiousness.

429
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,640
Something was about to happen.

430
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,240
And there's several other examples.

431
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,680
You can drill down deep into it.

432
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,960
A lot of people call this crap.

433
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,280
I find it highly interesting.

434
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,800
And so what entertaining to you?

435
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,720
So what entertaining just to watch a little dot

436
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,080
and see if it changes color from the time, time, time.

437
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,880
I heard this on the radio the other day, I thought,

438
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,080
man, this is timely once again.

439
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,560
Oh, now it's the day to come.

440
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,920
Because there's something in the air,

441
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,200
we got to get them together,

442
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,440
so the whole day to come.

443
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,840
Because from where the moon shines in,

444
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,880
I don't know what's right.

445
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,880
I don't know what it's like.

446
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,880
We have come to get it together.

447
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,880
We have come to get it together.

448
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,880
We have come to get it together.

449
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,880
We have come to get it together.

450
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
No, no, no.

451
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,880
I don't know what it's like.

452
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,880
I don't know what it's like.

453
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,880
I don't know what it's like.

454
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,880
Because there's something in the air,

455
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,880
we got to get them together,

456
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
so the whole day to come.

457
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,880
Because from where the moon shines in,

458
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:11,880
I don't know what it's like.

459
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,880
I don't know what it's like.

460
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,880
We have come to get it together.

461
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,880
We have come to get it together.

462
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,880
We have come to get it together.

463
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,880
We have come to get it together.

464
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,880
We have come to get it together.

465
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,880
We have come to get it together.

466
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,880
We have come to get it together.

467
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,880
We have come to get it together.

468
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,880
We have come to get it together.

469
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,880
We have come to get it together.

470
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,880
We have come to get it together.

471
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,880
We have come to get it together.

472
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,880
We have come to get it together.

473
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,880
We have come to get it together.

474
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,880
We have come to get it together.

475
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,880
We have come to get it together.

476
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,880
We have come to get it together.

477
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,880
We have come to get it together.

478
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,880
We have come to get it together.

479
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:57,880
We have come to get it.

480
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,880
We have come to get it together.

481
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:14,880
We have come to get it together.

482
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:25,240
and I think it's gonna happen there's a lot going on around the world this

483
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,480
is stuff you definitely will not read about in your local newspaper you're

484
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,440
not going to hear about it on the news on the six o'clock evening news

485
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,120
because nobody wants you to know that what's really happening in the world

486
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:43,520
because people are writing they are extremely pissed with what's happening

487
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,120
uh... let me just uh... here this is a great headline from the international

488
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,160
harrel tribune very reputable source french politicians fear youth violence

489
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,840
along the Greek pattern you barely hear anything about grease

490
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,920
but uh... there's writing going on uh... in fact here it is fire bombs breaking

491
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,320
glass tear gas burning cars

492
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,840
the images from grease this month were enough to put the fear of youth into the

493
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,320
hearts of european leaders particularly fron's

494
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,080
and uh... when you look at the numbers you can really understand why this is

495
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,160
happening now yes

496
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,720
in uh... grease the police shot and killed a fifteen-year-old boy

497
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,880
and that was the spark but it's really it's a tender box worldwide the rapid

498
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,040
rise and unemployment amongst young people under age of twenty five particularly

499
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,560
in southern europe

500
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,840
is a very big concern in spain for instance youth unemployment

501
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,640
shot up from eighteen point four percent in august of two thousand seven to twenty eight

502
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,880
point one percent in october

503
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,720
of two thousand eight

504
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,960
almost doubling

505
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,280
yes certainly uh...

506
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,040
sixty percent there the average jobless rate for young people and italy grease and

507
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,240
fron says well above the average for the european union

508
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,760
according to your stats the uh... luxembourg agency that collects e-use statistics

509
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,760
and uh... they're doing this uh... how many should have pulled this song out

510
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,840
uh... in grease there uh... the their plans songs on the radio like another brick

511
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,920
and the wall by pink floyd

512
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,520
which of course controls the leg contains the lyric we don't need no education we don't

513
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,680
need no thought control known dark sarcasm in the classroom

514
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,680
hey teacher leave those kids alone

515
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,200
oh man

516
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,560
island where of course uh... the ship first really hit the fan

517
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,120
this is from bloomberg

518
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,480
towards the week before christmas and rike vick and all through the town evahodok stir

519
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,200
but a band of sixty whistling blowing pan banging shouting demonstrators saying pay

520
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,800
your own debts

521
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:46,160
as they went from one bank to the other this is this is a civilized culture by the way

522
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,280
you know he's like people who have cell phones and iPads and uh... and uh... go to the

523
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,120
you know they watch football

524
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,400
and they got screwed they got screwed by their banks in the government but because

525
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,960
it only a three hundred twenty thousand uh...

526
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,560
head population

527
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,240
it happened a lot quicker and uh... and the news

528
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,760
the true news spread throughout the population much quicker of course than it'll

529
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,360
ever take us to

530
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,760
help people understand and and i've i'm coming back from this awakening idea i i really

531
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,360
think we should just say there are no secrets only information you don't yet have

532
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,960
as much more provocative

533
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,560
and this awakening

534
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,200
uh... because people who are asleep and sheep

535
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,480
don't like it you know you know you don't like to know likes being woken up for one and

536
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,120
whatever reason even if you're actually sleeping

537
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,360
you know i don't like the awoken up

538
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,240
and doesn't help but why here do i hear

539
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,840
mm

540
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,360
interesting i don't have the noise gate on today so i'm hearing all kinds of

541
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,920
extraneous stuff

542
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,920
uh... riots and grease this month sparked by the police shooting of a teenager became

543
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,720
tensed with economic dissension

544
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,440
a group of quady equity traders marched on the emir's office in october to demand

545
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,560
the closing of the stock exchange to stem losses even in u.s. city civil disorder is

546
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,160
conceivable

547
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:06,480
if unemployment rises above ten percent from november six point seven percent

548
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,640
so this uh... this lady eve uh... hoax dotter

549
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,400
uh... she said we will use our voices

550
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,640
if we have to will use our hands

551
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,120
or maybe even access

552
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
so

553
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,320
are these people just smarter are they further along have been they have been hurt more than

554
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,560
we have

555
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,480
like and tell you this all this money that's being thrown away literally

556
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,360
is m and it's just it's being thrown away general motors cheap executive rick whagnor

557
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,200
says hey we got we asked for nine point four billion dollars in loans over the next

558
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,760
twenty four days however investors

559
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,360
are betting against the company

560
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,760
they're taking all kinds of position saying even with that money they'll never make it

561
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,040
and of course when you think about it this plenty of money out there to be

562
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,040
invested in companies certainly in the automobile industry but why is it not happening

563
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,720
why is it no private money going into them because

564
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,520
in private investors they can read this balance sheet which apparently the federal

565
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:16,240
reserve and certainly are treasury cannot

566
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,520
the uh... united uh... nations

567
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,720

from his beer to his boots

he was covered with ammo

602
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,160
like a big bad drunk disgruntled

603
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,160
you'll not ramble

604
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
and it smiled at the sand

605
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
with a twinkle in his eye

00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,160
realize he couldn't get the wrong heel

612
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,160
some fine apples who stepped in his grave

613
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,800
well the workshop is gone now

614
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
he decided to bump in

615
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
everywhere you'll find the easiest

616
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800

headed by the few places

627
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800

703
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,680
which many of written in and said, oh, what a horrible name, because it sounds like you're

704
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:51,720
talking about the Curry Terrace or the Terrace house, but no, it's the Terrace house,

705
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,920
end of Terrace to be exact.

706
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,880
I am truly, really excited about getting the new studio set up.

707
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,920
I've ordered this beautiful 19-inch rack, which I'm only going to put the gear into,

708
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,520
that I know that I want, that I know they want to keep.

709
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,680
I probably don't even use that much since everything is pretty much 100% digital at this

710
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,680
point.

711
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:18,000
The only thing I'm actually using is external gear that I'm using is the, the maybe controller,

712
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,960
the, what is it, the fader fox.

713
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,120
And everything else is internal.

714
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,880
So I, I just want to have some stuff around, you know, so I can, I can produce different

715
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,880
sounds.

716
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:34,760
I got a big honk and Mac, xenon, dual, multi-quad, whatever processor thingy to really

717
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,840
crunch the video, looking forward to that.

718
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,640
Oh, before I forget, and it, it's probably too late by the time you're hearing this, but

719
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,880
you can always get an after Christmas gift for somebody.

720
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,080
We've got a lot of excellent deals, we've got fantastic sponsors of this program and

721
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,680
others across the media on that work.

722
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,880
Let me give you a quick rundown, finish line, which sells athletic clothing, Nike, Puma,

723
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,040
Didas, and more.

00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,040
You can get 15% off a purchase of $60 or more, and let's face it, $60 is, that's probably

725
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,080
just one item, maybe two.

726
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,520
If you use the code, mevio, dsc, guaranteed 50% off, can't get a cheaper online anywhere

in the world.

728
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:22,000
If you sign up for e-harmonie, and this is a reputable dating site, I think they're probably

729
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,240
one of the largest, not the largest.

730
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,280
It's not one of those porn hookers sites, like the ones I always get sucked into.

731
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,120
Oh, look at how hot she is, maybe she'll want to date.

732
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:39,840

the codes are already embedded in the link, go to the show notes, daily source code.com.

742
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,400
And as I said, cross posted at curie.com.

743
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,120
All right, let's take another call here, because I also have young, pled standing by

744
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,320
with a special Christmas edition of the Hit Test.

745
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,320
So let's move.

746
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Hey, Adam has a go in there.

747
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,320
That's a time listener.

748
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,320
Okay.

749
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,320
Sounds like someone from Ireland.

750
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,360
E-mailer and yeah, first time dropper, first time dropper.

751
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,360
I love it.

752
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:50,440
So anytime before, when I got in contact, you never saw any reason to use anything I said

753
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
in the show.

754
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,640
And that's fair enough, because I never really had anything worthwhile to say.

755
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,240
Ah, let me just say that it's sometimes I missed stuff sometimes.

756
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,280
Well, if you had nothing worthwhile to say and you said it anyway, that would probably

757
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
be your reason.

758
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,880
Most of the time though, the stuff is just too long.

759
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,680
It's like five, six minutes, you know, not from you, but from lots of people.

760
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,880
It's just there's no way I can play that.

761
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,120
And nothing is that interesting.

762
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,520
I'm not interesting for what do you think I play songs?

763
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,000
I'm just thinking for five or six minutes.

764
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,720
But right now, I've got a few views on this whole Lisbon treaty issue.

765
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,320
All right, this is the Lisbon treaty.

766
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:36,320
For those of you just tuning into this program, this thing was essentially the

767
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,240
derivative of the European Constitution, which circulated a number of years ago.

768
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,360
The French and the Dutch voted it down in public referenda.

769
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,080
And what the, and this is by their own admission, this is stated, you know, we're going

770
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,800
to do what just going to pull it all out, turn it into three different documents, remove

771
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,600
the word constitution.

772
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
And then we'll put it out there.

773
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,880
And then we won't let any countries hold the referendum, we'll just ram it through

774
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,440
all the individual governments.

775
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,760
Except for one country, the shining shamrock, Ireland said, no, no, no, no, this is

776
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
important stuff.

777
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
We want to have a referendum.

778
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,080
We want the people to actually vote.

779
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,680
They said, no, wait, don't want it.

780
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,680
Don't like it.

781
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,360
Not that anyone could actually understand the document, but we've delved into a very deep

782
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,960
on this program.

783
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,160
Horrible things when it comes to human rights.

784
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,600
Such as, yeah, you have a right to live and no one can kill you legally unless you're

785
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,000
running away from the police.

786
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,680
It doesn't say unless you're a murderer running away from the police, no, unless you

787
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,480
are running away from the police.

788
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,080
If you are hooked on drugs, alcohol, mentally unstable, which let's face it, I could be classified

789
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,720
as that.

790
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,240
If you have a communicable disease, you can be arrested and thrown in jail, children can

791
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,800
be taken away from their parents.

792
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,880
And all of this was said, oh, no, and I've talked to all of the euro parliamentarians.

793
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,560
I've talked to a minister of parliament in the Netherlands.

794
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,600
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, those are just guidelines, you know, each country can do its own

795
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
thing.

796
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,120
Yeah, bullshit.

797
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,720
So now, of course, it turns out they really needed this, Lisbon Treaty, all of its

798
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:13,960
legalese ramp through and ratified so that they could form the new world financial government

799
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,440
and subsequent, I guess the world government is what they're working on.

800
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,720
The new world order, you're hearing politicians openly say it now.

801
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,880
And they don't say it the way I say it.

802
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,440
Because when I say it, I get a nasty aftertaste, you know, kind of like you just threw

803
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,440
up in your mouth.

804
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,080
When they say it's like, it's like gold, I love it.

805
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:38,200
So of course, they're operating now under something they call operating, operating under

806
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,520
the Lisbon principles.

807
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,080
And I have no, I just don't have the time with a desire to do it, but I'm sure if you

808
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,560
really went delve deep down to the legalese of Lisbon Treaty, you'd see this whole financial

809
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,800
thing all tied up in with it.

810
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,080
So they're going back again because, of course, when the Irish said, no, well, yeah, that's

811
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,080
not acceptable.

812
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:02,840
Let's do another referendum, but see, if we can get them to say, yes, this time, they'll

813
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,920
keep going back until they get what they want.

814
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,920
That's what this is about.

815
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,760
I'm sorry, my friend, continue.

816
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,520
Or as the European Union likes to call it the Irish problem.

817
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,000
Yeah, the Irish problem.

818
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Yeah.

819
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,400
Well, recently our wonderful new T-shirt Mr. Biffel Count went over and had a little chat with

820
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,960
all of them over there and decided that he would come back here.

821
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,160
And completely ignore the results of the last referendum and, you know, go and have a

822
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,160
whole new one.

823
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,160
Yeah.

824
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,160
First.

825
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,160
And for me.

826
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,400
This is how they do it, by the way.

827
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,240
It's the same thing with the bailout, the people of America, a thousand to one, maybe

828
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,120
even more, we're calling in, calls being rejected, by the way, by the White House Switch

829
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,120
Board.

830
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,920
Websites taken down emails taken offline so that we could not communicate to our legally

831
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,440
chosen representatives, whether they're scum or not, because they'll just take whatever

832
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,440
they want.

833
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,840
And so Congress said, no, go back and we'll just ram it through the Senate until Congress

834
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,840
has to say yes.

835
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
I mean, it's that simple.

836
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,160
That's how politics is done.

837
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:13,800
Yeah, that's just disgusting and really odd.

838
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,960
There's no real words to express, you know, how I feel about this.

839
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,200
Listen to that.

840
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,200
This isn't Irishman, okay?

841
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,360
And when I think Irish, I think Jack Nicholson, right, Jack Nicholson, that's how he

842
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,880
has that Irish blood in him that can just explode.

843
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,680
And you can hear, here's a chucklehead at arms.

844
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,440
He is frustrated, angry doesn't know what to say.

845
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,720
His voice is not heard.

846
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,520
It's very obvious what comes next.

847
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,920
This is so stupid, so counterproductive.

848
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,920
But we have to fight it.

849
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,680
So we'll fight it however we have to.

850
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,760
And I stand proudly side by side with the Irish on this.

851
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:57,440
It's just, well, look, yeah, see, for the last referendum, we only really had two main

852
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,680
groups opposing it.

853
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:06,440
We had one political party, which was shinfane, which is really nothing more than the

854
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,360
redneck mafia of Irish politics.

855
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:15,240
So in all honesty, most people really really don't care what they have to say.

856
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:22,360
And then there was another group, and just a group of business people called Libertas.

857
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:29,640
And of course, since the referendum, the government and the national television station,

858
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:36,360
have been a little go at him and they've pounded him, they've gone after his past, all sorts

859
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,360
of stuff.

860
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:42,360
Sure, the EU themselves said to do a whole big bit of research on him and figure out

861
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,960
what's going on with him.

862
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:51,400
The guy had Declan Gannley, the main man of Libertas, to be honest, he's been made to look

863
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,680
like the kind of guy who'd be down on some street corner telling you to find the ace

864
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:06,520
in his three cards and there's only, maybe, two or five in a queen, so I don't know.

865
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:11,000
I think they really didn't touch on the right issues either, because most of the stuff was

866
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:20,680
going and looking at traditional Irish issues like, actually, EU stands on abortion and stuff

867
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:27,320
like that, and tax cuts and all sorts of things like that, and just general things that

868
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,080
people might worry about.

869
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,600
Yeah, you know, the kind of stuff that you should worry about in your own country.

870
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:39,240
I'm all for trading amongst nations and even the euro itself, although I'm completely against

871
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:45,880
central banking and which, of course, is the route of all of the problems that we have right now

872
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:51,480
and why billions and hunt actually trillions of dollars, euros, and pounds are being pumped

873
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,520
through the banking system, none of it actually, you know, they're just using it as an excuse,

874
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,640
but the jig is up, the game is over, that just stop working.

875
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,560
So yeah, but that's of concern, that is the main concern.

876
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,160
Same thing that you don't want to central banking your own country, your own state or even your own

877
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:15,560
it's crap, it's a stupid lame system designed to protect the banks, not to help you whatsoever.

878
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,760
I mean, for the longest period they were saying, oh, if this comes in, the French are just

879
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:27,320
going to raise our corporation tax in line with the rest of Europe, and that really didn't sit well

880
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:32,600
with people, especially known that, you know, the recession was coming on and we need as many companies

881
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:38,760
coming in as possible. So, so this leads me to believe that if the business leaders were protesting

882
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,440
against this, that they actually did have a good look at this Lisbon Treaty and said, hey,

883
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:48,040
wait a minute, this is a unification of everything. We don't want to be what those guys want to be.

884
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:54,440
We want to be Irish and have our own corporate taxes. Now, by the way, I can just hear

885
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:02,120
comic strip blogger yelling into his iPod there, or he probably uses a zoom saying, well, they took

886
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:07,400
billions of euros in subsidies from the European Union. Yep, that, of course, is also true.

887
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:13,480
But still, that was all before this Lisbon Treaty came to bear. So, I'd say,

888
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:19,320
fair and square, no, is no, no, is no. I don't know, but they really didn't touch on any of the

889
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:26,440
whole structural issues on it. You know, like how the EU will be structured and managed and

890
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,120
the simple fact that we don't even have, we don't even have a chance to vote in the people and

891
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:38,600
power over there anymore. And they don't seem to realize that by letting it into the constitution,

892
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:47,640
when these unelected assholes get in, you know, they can make up whatever crazy rules they want,

893
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,040
and we have to follow them. Yeah, oh, yeah. All kinds of crazy rules coming down the pike.

894
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,320
And it's going to start with the internet very, very soon. Even this program, I guarantee you

895
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:04,200
will be violating laws within the next 24 months. There will be laws that will be violated on this

896
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:10,440
program. And guess what, the violating will continue. And I don't know, personally, I think people

897
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:17,480
should look more into that side of things. And sure, I'm going to be working on that myself.

898
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:24,200
I'm going to get out and start telling people, no, to this in Lisbon thing. I mean,

899
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:29,160
I voted no, and I want my vote to count. And right now, it doesn't. So I'm going to make sure that

900
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:36,680
next time around, it does. Anyway, love the hair. I think mine's better. See you around.

901
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:42,200
That's probably ginger top, huh? All right. Well, if it does come around, if they do set up another

902
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:47,160
referendum, we'll just go through the whole thing again. We'll dissect the Lisbon Treaty once again,

903
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:53,000
explain to the Europeans. And obviously to the Irish exactly what it means. And we will continue to

904
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:04,120
fight that. Because it's, it's necessary. We got to stand up. All right. Uh, it's the 23rd.

905
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:09,960
Uh, the Eve before Christmas Eve. I need a little bit of Christmas music. It's titled the Christmas

906
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:25,000
edition. I'm hoping it contains some. Hey, Adam, how you doing? I'm good man, Merry Christmas.

907
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,560
This is the Christmas edition of the hit-est. Yep. Have we got to start right away with intro?

908
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:34,440
Number one. Oh, yes. One of my favorite Christmas songs.

909
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:40,600
That's uh, Chris Ria. I'll be driving home for Christmas. Oh, cool, man. I like this.

910
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,360
Number two.

911
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:56,040
It'll be lonely this Christmas. Oh, I don't think Americans know that one at all. And number three.

912
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:02,040
It's the most expensive. And it really is, I guess.

913
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:09,080
Truly a, uh, some Christmas here there, y'all. And it's time for the answers.

914
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,280
Yeah, this is answer number one in this Christmas edition of the hit-est.

915
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,720
This is Chris Ria. And he's driving home for Christmas.

916
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,800
Oh, I can't wait to see those faces.

917
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,800
Driving home for Christmas. Yeah.

918
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,440
Come up, we don't hold the ground.

919
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,600
All right, nice.

920
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,960
This Ria's answer number one.

921
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,360
Yeah. This is answer number two. I love this. This is mud.

922
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:59,800
I'm trying to imagine a, I'm a Christmas all alone.

923
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:07,400
It'll be lonely in this Christmas, without you, it's too hot.

924
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:14,760
It'll be cold, it's so cold without you, it's too hot.

925
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:19,160
Oh, this Christmas.

926
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,680
It'll be lovely. This Christmas is answer number two.

927
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,160
Mud. And this is indeed free.

928
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,560
This is as you will.

929
00:52:44,840 --> 00:53:00,280
We're going one love once a year. It's the most wonderful time of the year. And it will be us.

930
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:07,240
As answer number three. And that concludes this Christmas edition of the hit-est.

931
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,280
So Adam. Yes, y'all. How did you do this week?

932
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,280
Well, if I hadn't gotten six out of six on that one, I would have been pretty pathetic.

933
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,040
But Mud was a curveball I liked it. Thanks, Y'all, and Merry Christmas.

934
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,400
Once again, to you and your family.

935
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,840
Like always, the answers to this and any other hit-est.

936
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,240
And also the links to iTunes, you can buy this tracks featured on the hit-est online.

937
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,560
Not to be found at hittest.mefio.com.

938
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,840
Thanks for playing Adam. Thank you, Y'all.

939
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,360
Everyone else. Thank you for listening.

940
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,720
Next week, I'll turn me back for another hit-est. So, one till then.

941
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,400
Have fun. Take care. Think with your hearts.

942
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,720
And Merry Christmas, everybody. Bye-bye.

943
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:03,320
Wow. 152 episodes. Holy moly. Merry Christmas, Y'all.

944
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,680
I like that one, dude. It's cool.

945
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,640
Actually, I was thinking of playing a couple of those songs.

946
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,280
And then I saw that you had a Christmas edition.

947
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,200
Like, no, I'm going to hold off. I'm happy.

948
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,840
I definitely would have played Chris Rhea. That's for sure.

949
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,240
So, I've been talking about setting up a live call-in system.

950
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,080
Something that I can actually manage myself.

951
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,640
And I've been looking in two different directions.

952
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,280
Actually, three different directions.

953
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,880
One is some form of a conference calling system,

954
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,040
which we have tried before with Talks Show.

955
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,920
But it doesn't really allow you to talk to people,

956
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,400
stack up calls, put them on hold, keep them waiting,

957
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,920
then bring them in one by one.

958
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,440
I have considered actually doing that with a hosted conference calling service.

959
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,680
So, you've called in and you talked to the operator, the operator.

960
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,240
And there are lots of companies around there that will actually do this.

961
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,680
It says, it's not all that expensive.

962
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,600
And all they have to do is write down your name,

963
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,120
where you're from, as an example, and what you want to talk about.

964
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,560
And they could even IM me that while I'm doing the show.

965
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,480
And then, but then still, they would be adding that person into the queue.

966
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,480
So, I have to say, okay, you know, Pete from Portland.

967
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,680
And then the operator would have to be on the ball listening and plug the person in.

968
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,280
And, of course, I can't cut the person.

969
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,480
I need to hold a bunch of different things.

970
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,480
I wouldn't want to be able to do that way.

971
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,480
The most obvious route is to get some kind of

972
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,840
virtual switchboard.

973
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,920
And so, I've been looking around.

974
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,920
There are tons of companies that do kind of kind of what I need,

975
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,360
but not everything.

976
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,640
There's certainly nothing that I've really been able to find that,

977
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,360
well, there's systems that will stack up calls,

978
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,840
but then they take them in order, and you can't talk to people

979
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:49,320
while they're on hold, and you can't plug the show's audio back into what they're listening while they're on hold.

980
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:55,240
And my old friend, PC from Down Under, he's been working on this.

981
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:59,960
He's, we've been trading emails, and he has an idea as to how he wants to set this up.

982
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,960
And he's even set up a website because he believes that this is a technology that

983
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,320
once developed would have greater good for the rest of the world.

984
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,920
Well, there you go.

985
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:13,560
And he sent me a comment as requested to explain a little bit deeper about what

986
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,960
what track he's on and how we're going to solve this problem.

987
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,280
Mr. Gary, part master, Phil from Sydney.

988
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:20,920
Yep.

989
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:26,840
I just wanted to discuss with you the possible options for your

990
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,080
live call for them with call queueing, and how it can actually be done.

991
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:37,400
I think you're going to have to use Skype as the main call and method.

992
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,520
By the way, I'm really happy with using Skype.

993
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:44,440
I have lots of VoIP systems. I use Gizmo Skype.

994
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:49,160
Barnon just performs best gives you the best quality, certainly over time.

995
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,240
But of course, as far as I know, it's only one, in fact, here's a question.

996
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:56,360
How many incoming Skype calls can I actually handle?

997
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,880
Um, I know that if one person calls another person calls, I can answer it

998
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,280
then the original person goes on hold.

999
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:09,480
I'm presuming what Phil means here is I use my Skype to call into some form of

1000
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,640
a phone bank and that that's where I make my connection to multiple phone.

1001
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:18,760
Because you can get Skype at numbers for the countries that you need to participate.

1002
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,560
Yeah, I got those.

1003
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:24,040
Got a lot of course, people can just call them, you know, Skype off their desktop.

1004
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,960
So I think what you need at your end is going to, you want to need a Skype gateway,

1005
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:35,640
something like a skip to PBX, which is going to be able to convert the Skype callers

1006
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:43,160
into SIP at the back end and you're going to need something like an Asterix VoIP system.

1007
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,120
Yeah, see, this is where my eyes start to glaze over.

1008
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:52,360
I actually, I, there's an Asterix, which is kind of a software based phone

1009
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,400
switcher PBX, they call it.

1010
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:02,840
There's one for Mac OS 10 and I installed it and I was like, okay, I just installed it and they're like,

1011
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,320
now what? I couldn't get into work.

1012
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:10,440
Yeah, I did that amongst all the other things. I, I took about an hour and a half of looking at

1013
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:17,640
Asterix, big mistake, not a place I should venture to any more IPPBX that's going to be

1014
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:23,880
able to take the feed from the gateway and filter into Asterix and then provide some sort of

1015
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:30,360
callcuring or with some sort of Asterix, third party add-on. They're okay, hold on a second.

1016
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:37,000
So what Phil is saying is we reverse it and have the Skype in numbers going to a PBX and then

1017
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,240
the PBX apparently, I guess I'll just jack right into my sound system. I think there are

1018
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:48,520
quite how you're going to jack it into your sound system. Yeah, I can use a jack router for that,

1019
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:53,960
which is what I use in my mouth. I'll use jack router. So I think you're probably, that's jack

1020
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:58,680
router and OS X on the Apple. I think you're probably going to have to switch to using

1021
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:04,040
jack router on Linux because I know they've got native support for sippin asterix.

1022
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:11,880
Yeah, that's, that's, that's going to be a non-starter, my friend. I'm definitely tied into the Apple

1023
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:17,560
platform with all of my recording gear. So that's, that's my suggestion. I've actually set up a

1024
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:24,040
website to just the discussion forum to try and figure out how you can do this. It's quite an

1025
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:30,040
interesting problem and one that has quite a global reach. So it seems like a good idea to have a

1026
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:34,120
central point where we're, where people can suggest perhaps all the ways to do it,

1027
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:43,320
best or worse in mind. The website is www.makingcarry.tv. That would be Mike,

1028
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:53,400
Alpha, Kilo, India, November, Golf, Charlie, uniform, Romeo, Romeo, Yankee.tv. Yeah, let me know

1029
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:58,920
what you think. Chocolate, take a visit. I'll suggest some ways to do this if you're sound engineer

1030
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:06,200
or if you're a voice engineer. Let's discuss it. Great here. Hope you win. They work for us.

1031
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:13,640
Yo, well, there's one thing is for sure, whether we solve the problem or not,

1032
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:21,880
that makingcarry.tv, I guarantee you at some point in the future there's going to be a television

1033
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,800
program about making curry dishes and they'll want to buy that off you. So it's going to be

1034
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:33,240
worth something. And I hope you used my discount code DSC3 at godaddy.com for that. This is something

1035
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:37,720
that showed up on the source code drop. Drop.io slash daily source code. We're truly there

1036
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:46,440
are no secrets only information you don't yet have. This is a mix of three, well, at one point

1037
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:51,720
they were all three candidates, but it is President Bush. Presidential candidate John McCain

1038
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:57,800
and President elect Barack Obama. Over the course of the past few months talking about the

1039
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:06,840
economy, please pay very close attention to the similarity in what they're saying. The words,

1040
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:13,080
the rhythm, the speeches, almost all identical. These are not three people working for individual

1041
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:18,600
parties or different agendas or competing with each other. These are three people working for the

1042
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:26,920
same master. Listen, if the financial rescue bill fails in Congress yet again, the value of your home

1043
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:31,400
could plummet. Families looking for a new home will be unable to get a loan. It's going to be harder

1044
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:36,760
for you to get a mortgage for your home. New car sales will come to a halt or the loans you need to buy a

1045
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,600
car. It would be more difficult for you to get the loans you need to buy a car or send your

1046
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:44,840
children to college. No longer be able to get loans for college. My businesses would close

1047
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:49,720
their doors, maybe unable to pay employee. Thousands of businesses could call. In millions of

1048
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:54,520
Americans could lose their job. Millions of jobs could be lost. We failed to act. And ultimately

1049
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:00,040
our country could experience a long and painful recession. It reminds me of if you are not with

1050
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:06,200
them, then you are with the terrorists. It's just terror. That's what they're doing. Because what

1051
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:12,920
is this money actually done this 700 billion in hard cash? And then the 8.8.6 now I think

1052
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:21,000
trillion dollars that the federal reserve has loaned out given away guaranteed bought assets with

1053
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:29,080
which they won't even tell us what they've spent it on. This is the outrageous part from the

1054
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:36,040
associated press. In fact, the title of this, I like what the AP is doing here, the title of

1055
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:41,800
this article, where the bailout money goes. It's a secret. That's literally the headline.

1056
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:49,800
So they went around since the need of the treasury nor the federal reserve

1057
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:57,880
will which is the American Central Bank bad news folks. Since they won't tell us or anyone

1058
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:04,200
including apparently associated press or Bloomberg, we've mentioned those articles many, many times.

1059
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,440
They went around to the banks and they said, hey, what are you doing with the money that you receive?

1060
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:15,160
Well, here are some of the answers. Bank of New York, Melon, which received $3 billion says

1061
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:23,880
spokesman Kevin Heiney or Heine. We're choosing not to disclose that. Thomas Kelly spokesman for

1062
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:29,000
JP Morgan Chase, which received $25 billion in emergency bailout money, said that while some

1063
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,960
of the money was lent, some was not and the bank has not given any accounting of exactly how the

1064
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:39,800
money is being used. Kelly said, we have not disclosed that to the public. We're declining to

1065
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:47,320
associated press contacted 21 banks that received at least $1 billion in government money,

1066
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:53,720
my money, your money, and asked for questions. How much has been spent? What was it spent on?

1067
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:58,760
How much is being held in savings and what is the plan for the rest? Not a single one of these 21

1068
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:03,880
banks provided any specific answers. Here's another one. Barry Coulding spokesman for

1069
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:10,360
Leonard Georgia based Sun Trust banks. They got $3.5 billion in taxpayer money. We're not providing

1070
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:18,120
dollar in dollar outtracking. We manage our capital in its aggregate said Regions Financial

1071
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:28,920
Court spokesman Tim Dayton, another $3.5 billion recipient. This is unbelievable. Unbelievable.

1072
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:36,200
That these questions aren't they're just refusing to answer the questions. They got this money

1073
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:44,280
for free from us. Not entirely correct, but they got his money to help them. We know that billions

1074
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:52,760
have gone to bonuses, but for them to not even tell us what they're using it for. How much longer can

1075
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:58,760
this idiocy continue? Well, quite some while apparently. Dr. Ron Paul, who now of course

1076
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:04,840
is a favorite on Fox News, he used to be called a cook. Now that Fox has turned around and of course

1077
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:11,320
Fox hates Obama. They can have him on all the time. Here he is once again talking about

1078
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:16,760
exactly this issue. Or they just simply refuse to disclose it. Texas Republican Ron Paul, he joins

1079
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:22,920
me now on the phone. Congressman, what do you make of all of this? Well, it looks like it's more of the

1080
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:28,280
thing. Same old story. The taxpayer coughs up. The money's passed out. Nobody knows what

1081
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:33,880
happens to it. But even sometimes we don't even appropriate the money. There's two trillion dollars.

1082
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:41,240
The sad has issues and they tell us that it would be counterproductive to tell us where it's going.

1083
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:49,880
So we don't have any oversight to down the banks' status, but just not too long ago we had a report

1084
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:57,320
that we passed out $23 billion in Iraq for rebuilding in its total loss. They can account for it.

1085
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:02,280
I don't know how long this could last. And here that $23 billion in Iraq that is just

1086
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:08,440
unaccounted for. It's just gone. This is a congressman of the United States and elected representative

1087
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:14,680
he's been a congressman for over a decade. And he's on the banking committee and he can't get

1088
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:20,920
the answers. And like any sense at all. And yet we limp along, but nobody should be surprised

1089
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:26,120
that we're in financial difficulty when we run our fears the way we do. Yes sir, I understand that,

1090
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:31,080
but your congressman, don't you guys have the power to enforce some accountability here?

1091
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:36,040
You would think so. And I'm on the banking committee. Every year I've been in congress. I've been

1092
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:40,200
on the banking committee. I've always been interested in monetary policy. I'm on the domestic monetary

1093
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:46,360
policy subcommittee. But I have no authority whatsoever to look at what the federal reserve does.

1094
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:51,560
And that's, of course, there's a big culprit. But the question you asked earlier about

1095
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,800
are the tarp money? That's money appropriate by congress. But they rushed it through to the

1096
01:06:55,800 --> 01:07:01,320
river of the panics. They were here in the land. So there were no restrictions placed on the legislation.

1097
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:06,200
And now the congressman, to come up late, say hey, why don't you tell us what you're doing?

1098
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:10,840
And they either don't know or don't want us to know and don't feel compelled to tell us.

1099
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:17,560
But you know, that is that is. The real problem is, is why are we in the business of taking money

1100
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:24,840
one group and handing it out to another group? That's the question. What is that all about?

1101
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:29,400
Keep your eye on the ball because at the end of the day money doesn't matter tonight.

1102
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:59,240
Never, ever has enough to treat as late as right. He does pushes away in a hug.

1103
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:11,400
Says, money don't matter tonight. Mine don't matter tonight. Show it, man. Yes, indeed.

1104
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:20,360
Just when you think you got all that in love, swear it all up and fly the way.

1105
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:28,440
Then when you find out that you're better, I'm thinking sure you're so all right.

1106
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:37,960
Because money didn't matter, he has the day. And a show don't matter tonight.

1107
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:51,480
If they could invest, they'd tell him he just can't lose. So we go out and try to find a bond.

1108
01:08:52,120 --> 01:09:03,960
But all it finds are users. All it finds are snakes in every kind of a nationality at size.

1109
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:11,240
Seems like the only thing that he can do is just go to his eye.

1110
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:22,280
Says, money don't matter tonight. Show it, man. Yes, indeed.

1111
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:30,760
Just when you think you got all that in love, swear it all up and fly the way.

1112
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:38,280
Then when you find out that you're better, I'm thinking sure you're so all right.

1113
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:48,280
Because money didn't matter, he has the day. And a show don't matter tonight.

1114
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,240
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

1115
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:48,280
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, baby, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, have you, your nonsense, I're ok, pk, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1116
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:53,280
Tell me, do you think you got all that in love?

1117
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,280
That's you, where did all of it get lost?

1118
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,280
I don't wait, I don't wait

1119
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:01,280
I don't, when you find out that you better love

1120
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,280
Think to show your soul, boy

1121
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,280
I said, that you saw me home

1122
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:10,280
Money paid, money is the day

1123
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:15,280
The show don't matter tonight

1124
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:19,280
I don't matter tonight

1125
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,280
It's show it man

1126
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,280
Ah, the man is such a genius

1127
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,280
Friends, money don't matter tonight

1128
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,280
Sure, that matter yesterday

1129
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,280
That depends on how you keep score, I guess

1130
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:37,280
But it is really true, just doesn't matter

1131
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,280
And it has a funny way of flying away from you

1132
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,280
Just when you think you have enough

1133
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,280
To take it from the voice of experience

1134
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,280
Up and up and down that roller coaster

1135
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:48,280
Let's see

1136
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,280
Oh yes, it is

1137
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,280
We do get triple witching just before Christmas

1138
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,280
Which is the expiration of all kinds of options

1139
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,280
Usually Wall Street looking for what they call the Santa Claus

1140
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,280
Rally where stocks go up

1141
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,280
I can actually, I can take a quick little look for you

1142
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:07,280
See how the markets are doing at this very moment

1143
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:11,280
Again, this is being recorded on the 23rd of December 2008

1144
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:15,280
Where we see Dow is down 50 points

1145
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,280
At the moment it's been down a little bit more than that

1146
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,280
So probably not a lot happening today

1147
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,280
Over in the advanced police state of the United Kingdom

1148
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,280
But in all this get-mownation, these things are heating up

1149
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,280
And getting pretty freaking wacky

1150
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,280
They talk about bailiffs here

1151
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:36,280
Which I guess you'd almost call that the repo man

1152
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,280
In the US

1153
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,280
They've been given new powers

1154
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,280
Or apparently powers they already had

1155
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,280
But they're now being formalized

1156
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,280
Where they can break down your door

1157
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,280
If you have an overdue debt

1158
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:55,280
An overdue debt like unpaid credit card

1159
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,280
Which could happen maybe a car payment

1160
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,280
But they will now break down your door

1161
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:03,280
Many examples is reported by the Times of London

1162
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:07,280
As a fact, this is an elderly couple

1163
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,280
Which was really a horrible story

1164
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,280
Let me see if I can find that

1165
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,280
All of these links of course in the show

1166
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,280
Know to dailysourcego.com

1167
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,280
We're crossposted to curry.com

1168
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,280
It's from the Daily Mail

1169
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:20,280
But it's not an elderly couple

1170
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:23,280
Anyway, the Debra missed a payment

1171
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,280
Missed one payment

1172
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,280
Boom

1173
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,280
Bailiff knocks down the door

1174
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,280
So they're now allowed to just break in

1175
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,280
In the Netherlands, I learned

1176
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,280
While I was there over

1177
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,280
Over the weekend with the Lady Patricia

1178
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:43,280
I learned that they're now proposing new legislation

1179
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,280
Which I'm sure will pass

1180
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,280
And if it's happening in one country these days

1181
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,280
With the way everything's going

1182
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:51,280
With this one financial and new world government order

1183
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,280
It's going to happen everywhere

1184
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:57,280
The IRS will actually be allowed to take money

1185
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:01,280
From your bank account if you are in a rears

1186
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:04,280
So if you owe them money and by the way

1187
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:07,280
The tax guys do mess up a lot

1188
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,280
In fact nine out of ten times

1189
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,280
That I've been torn apart

1190
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,280
Investigated turned upside down inside out

1191
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,280
There was no change whatsoever

1192
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,280
In one instance there was

1193
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,280
There was like a $27,000 difference

1194
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:24,280
But that had to do with an intercontinental exchange of money

1195
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:27,280
And I was wrong they were right

1196
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,280
According to their illegal taking of my money

1197
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,280
But there you go

1198
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,280
It's not constitutional

1199
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:39,280
So now in the it'll start in the Netherlands

1200
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,280
If you own the money and if they think they're right

1201
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,280
They'll just take it from you

1202
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,280
This is impossible anywhere else

1203
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,280
In any other form of transaction

1204
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,280
Except with the government they'll just take your money

1205
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,280
Take it

1206
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,280
But thank you very much

1207
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,280
And they have all kinds of laws where they can freeze bank accounts

1208
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,280
That's one thing because possession

1209
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,280
You know as they say is still nine ten to the law

1210
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,280
But to actually take that money from your account is pretty disgusting

1211
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,280
And headed your way

1212
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,280
I found a YouTube clip

1213
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,280
It's a Diane Sawyer talking with

1214
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,280
Jim Carrey and

1215
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,280
Two people with a passion

1216
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,280
And Jenny McCarthy

1217
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,280
Talking and I just want you to hear this

1218
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,280
Because you can hear from someone else from besides me

1219
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,280
Their son was born with autism

1220
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:33,280
And it's not very clear how autism

1221
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,280
Or where it originates from

1222
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:39,280
If it's genetic, hereditary

1223
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,280
You know there's all kinds of theories out there

1224
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:47,280
And they totally believe that it has to do with a combination of things

1225
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,280
Including too many vaccinations

1226
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,280
And the shit that's in these vaccination shots

1227
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:58,280
And I just want you to listen to a little bit of what Jenny McCarthy says

1228
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:01,280
Because she's saying pretty much exactly what I've been saying

1229
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:04,280
Only she's a little

1230
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,280
Well she makes more sense perhaps

1231
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,280
And she's a hell of a lot cuter

1232
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,280
Listen to this

1233
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,280
So it's really good

1234
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:12,280
Cause that has been provocative bringing her praise

1235
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:15,280
Controversy and a higher calling

1236
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,280
Three and a half years ago Jenny McCarthy began

1237
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,280
What she calls the search for her son's life

1238
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:25,280
I found Evan Seizing his crib

1239
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:29,280
And he was filming at the mouth and his eyes roll back

1240
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,280
Doctors first said Evan had epilepsy

1241
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:35,280
But she says her maternal instincts told her something more

1242
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,280
A second opinion, the devastating diagnosis

1243
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,280
He said

1244
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,280
I'm sorry your son has autism

1245
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,280
I died

1246
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,280
I crumbled

1247
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,280
She immediately went online looking for ways to help

1248
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,280
Finding a website offering hope with something called

1249
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,280
Biomedical intervention

1250
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:58,280
Controversial diet many parents claim was helping their autistic children

1251
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,280
Many doctors still skeptical

1252
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:03,280
But she forced ahead putting him on a wheat and dairy-free diet

1253
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,280
And two weeks later

1254
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,280
Just listen to this

1255
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:09,280
So we changed his diet

1256
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,280
Cute kid, by the way

1257
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:12,280
Change his diet

1258
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,280
Took him off wheat

1259
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,280
Which I'm sure

1260
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,280
I'm sure is directly related to genetic

1261
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,280
Genetically modified organisms in the food

1262
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,280
And dairy

1263
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:27,280
And gosh there's a lot in the dairy products

1264
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,280
And miraculous, miraculous change in just two weeks time

1265
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,280
He doubled his language

1266
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,280
He stopped tantruming, his eye contact got better

1267
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,280
And he slept for the night

1268
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,280
Through laying in bed and watching a cartoon

1269
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,280
He laughed at the abstract joke

1270
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,280
And I remember going

1271
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,280
Oh my god

1272
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,280
I literally start jumping on my bad screaming

1273
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,280
I'm pulling out of the window

1274
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,280
I'm pulling him out of the window

1275
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,280
I see

1276
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,280
Judy says

1277
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,280
Evan's new diet combined with therapy

1278
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,280
And medications allowed him to make a recovery

1279
01:17:55,280 --> 01:18:00,280
But doctors now say he was likely never autistic to begin with

1280
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,280
That's the way it is

1281
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,280
Oh no that was a misdiagnosis

1282
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,280
I'm sorry

1283
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,280
No no no

1284
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,280
All the shit the word ministering your kid

1285
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,280
That can't be to blame

1286
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,280
And in fact you never had that in the first place

1287
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,280
You get your dream in it

1288
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,280
And don't it?

1289
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:14,280
She remains an advocate fighting for evidence

1290
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:15,280
Other children

1291
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:18,280
Along the side of the man she calls the autism

1292
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,280
Whisperer

1293
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,280
And now we are joined by Jenny McCarthy and her partner

1294
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,280
The Whisperer himself

1295
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,280
I just know play a little bit more of this

1296
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,280
Because she really is quite eloquent

1297
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,280
And what she says

1298
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,280
And listen, particularly to the facts about mercury

1299
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,280
That take a harder look

1300
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,280
As some tougher questions about the way children are vaccinated

1301
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,280
In this country, good morning to both

1302
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,280
Good morning, thank you so much for having us

1303
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,280
Jenny, I want to get this clear right at the outset

1304
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:47,280
You are not against vaccinations

1305
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,280
You want to stress the importance of vaccinations

1306
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,280
But you want to walk

1307
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:55,280
My self and the autism community

1308
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:59,280
Really have been saying we are not an anti-vaccine group

1309
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:04,280
We believe that vaccines need to take a closer look at what the ingredients are

1310
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:08,280
And that the schedule is too many, too soon

1311
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:12,280
A lot of people aren't aware that mercury is still in the shots

1312
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:15,280
You'll see report if the report of people saying they have been removed

1313
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,280
And it truly hasn't

1314
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,280
The FDA still has 11 shots

1315
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,280
Still contain mercury

1316
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,280
And other ingredients like ether and antifreeze

1317
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,280
That we believe

1318
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,280
Really played a role in our child's autism

1319
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,280
And for a

1320
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,280
You a pharmaceutical nuts out there

1321
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,280
Chocolate heads of the medical profession

1322
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:33,280
Please explain

1323
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:36,280
What does antifreeze have any business doing

1324
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,280
In vaccines

1325
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,280
And ammonia and mercury

1326
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,280
Why is it in there?

1327
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:45,280
No wonder our kids are for our refer

1328
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,280
Screwed in the head

1329
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:50,280
But you know we also believe it's not the sole reason for autism

1330
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,280
But it does vaccines do play a major role

1331
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,280
Now

1332
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,280
Yeah, okay, she's being political there

1333
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,280
But it's good, it's good the way she's putting it

1334
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:00,280
You know that they've done a lot in saving lives

1335
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,280
But we do know for many children

1336
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,280
They are causing damage

1337
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,280
People to take a closer look at them

1338
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,280
Destroyed a vaccine program

1339
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,280
We're here to lend our voices to

1340
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,280
The millions of people who are calling for balance

1341
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,280
And moderation

1342
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,280
When it comes to the substance as we give our children

1343
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,280
They're not bottomless pissed

1344
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,280
That you can endlessly pour these substances

1345
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:22,280
Absolutely

1346
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,280
You have to consider the cumulative effect

1347
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,280
Not only that

1348
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,280
But the possible interaction

1349
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:32,280
Every other drug has interactions with other drugs

1350
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:35,280
And yet they assume that vaccines won't

1351
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,280
I can't appalling

1352
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,280
You know there was shoes administered

1353
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,280
Eight shots and one visit

1354
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,280
And you know part of this rally is just

1355
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,280
It's interesting because I'm looking at Diane

1356
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,280
So her she's almost looking annoyed

1357
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,280
While they're talking

1358
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,280
It's on a split screen

1359
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,280
And she really is making annoyed face

1360
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,280
You know speak up parents

1361
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,280
Space the shots out

1362
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,280
We're not saying get rid of them

1363
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,280
Slow down

1364
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,280
Yeah, we'll get rid of a couple of them

1365
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,280
Absolutely

1366
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,280
There's a lot of stuff

1367
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,280
Like the anti-servical

1368
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,280
Cancer drug which doesn't actually

1369
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:06,280
Solve or fix or prevent against cancer

1370
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:09,280
And contains all this crap heavy metals mercury

1371
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,280
And right as you can

1372
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,280
Killing and paralyzing young girls

1373
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,280
The scientific community has said

1374
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,280
In many cases there isn't

1375
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:20,280
No chemical of any kind in the vaccine

1376
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:24,280
But also if it's there it's in a modified or very small dose

1377
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,280
That's exactly right

1378
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,280
That's what they say

1379
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,280
It's not there

1380
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,280
And if it is it's modified or it's a very small dose

1381
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:33,280
It's like the melamine in your milk

1382
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,280
It's okay

1383
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:38,280
The FDA has approved 2.25 parts per million

1384
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,280
It's a little bit is okay

1385
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,280
You're not going to die from that

1386
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,280
Just a little bit

1387
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,280
What is it doing there in the first place

1388
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,280
What a point out something Jenny

1389
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,280
That I read is this right

1390
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,280
That in the 1980s

1391
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,280
Little children were given only ten vaccines at a time

1392
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,280
And now they're given 36

1393
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:55,280
Man 36 vaccines

1394
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:58,280
If they're not out to kill us

1395
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,280
They're certainly making a killing off of us

1396
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,280
Off of our kids

1397
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,280
36 vaccines

1398
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,280
Nuts

1399
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,280
All right

1400
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,280
One more link I'd like you to take a look at

1401
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,280
Which I'm not going to read through right now

1402
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:12,280
But is a very interesting read from Voltairenet.org

1403
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,280
Which I'd never visited before

1404
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:18,280
The title of it is called Operation Sarcosi

1405
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,280
This is about the French president

1406
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:23,280
Who was up until the middle of this month

1407
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,280
Also the president of the European Union

1408
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:29,280
That has now been transferred over to the Czech Republic

1409
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,280
Which is by self is interesting

1410
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,280
Operation Sarcosi

1411
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,280
How the CIA placed one of its agents

1412
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:38,280
At the presidency of the French Republic

1413
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:42,280
And it's a fascinating, fascinating article

1414
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,280
About Sarcosi

1415
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,280
His connections to the mob

1416
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,280
How the mob

1417
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,280
Operated with

1418
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:55,280
These are how we're going back to Charles the Gaul time now

1419
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,280
The CIA integrated with NATO

1420
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:04,280
I mean you know how Sarcosi used funds from

1421
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:09,280
Multiple sources including from the elf group

1422
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,280
Which today is known as total big oil

1423
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,280
And

1424
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:17,280
And how Sarcosi is consistently used

1425
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:22,280
The gossip press to cover up big issues

1426
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,280
That we're going on around him

1427
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,280
And they've really said this article

1428
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:28,280
Really says that his whole marriage to Carla

1429
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,280
Bruni is a complete scam

1430
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,280
And look at pictures of that girl

1431
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,280
Will ya?

1432
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,280
Take a look at some pictures

1433
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,280
And tell me she isn't like a bit glossy eyed

1434
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,280
Let's play a song of hope

1435
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,280
A song with a message

1436
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,280
From a man I miss very, very dearly

1437
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,280
To a Frederick Mercury

1438
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,280
Listen to the lyrics Chuckleheads or Google him

1439
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,280
In you window

1440
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,280
The unimitable queen on the chart

1441
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:19,280
While the sun hangs in the sky

1442
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,280
And the desert has set

1443
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,280
While the waves crashing the sea

1444
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,280
We can land

1445
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:33,280
While the wind in the stars

1446
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,280
And the rainbow

1447
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,280
Till the mountains grow up

1448
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,280
And it's late

1449
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,280
Oh

1450
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,280
Yes

1451
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,280
We'll keep on crying

1452
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,280
Spread them behind

1453
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,280
Oh

1454
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,280
We'll keep on crying

1455
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,280
Yeah

1456
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,280
Just lost in us

1457
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,280
Oh

1458
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:22,280
While we live and calling to race

1459
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,280
Cut our creed

1460
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,280
While we rule my life

1461
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:30,280
And there's no creed

1462
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,280
I like dictated by tradition

1463
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,280
Superstition

1464
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,280
More brilliant

1465
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,280
A brilliant young man

1466
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,280
And our

1467
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,280
Oh

1468
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:48,280
Yes

1469
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,280
We'll keep on crying

1470
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,280
We'll keep on crying

1471
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,280
Oh

1472
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,280
We'll keep on crying

1473
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,280
So the end of time

1474
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,280
Till the end of time

1475
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,280
Until the end of time

1476
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,280
Till the end of time

1477
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,280
Until the end of time

1478
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,280
Till the end of time

1479
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:27,280
You can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't be anything you want to do, you can't

This is a God already kind of justice under the sky

1482
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:45,280
If there's a voice, if there's a reason to live under

1483
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:53,280
If there's an answer to the question, if there's a word to ask

1484
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:59,280
So yes, this drop is, please, you may ask

1485
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:05,280
Oh yes, you keep on trying

1486
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:11,280
Hey, let's run from the valley

1487
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:18,280
Hey, let's run from the valley

1488
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:24,280
Hey, let's run from the valley

1489
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:29,280
We'll be

1490
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,280
We'll be

1491
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,280
We'll be

1492
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,280
We'll be

1493
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:44,280
We'll be

01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:45,280
Please

1495
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,280
If you went down

1496
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,280
Reven up

1497
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:51,280
Did the source code 812

1498
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:55,280
Save her your freedom, my friends

1499
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:59,280
There are no secrets, only information you don't yet have

1500
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:03,280
And whatever you do, live your life with passion

1501
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:18,280
There is a war going on for your mind

1502
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:24,280
Idiom, mavens, mouth surgical strikes from tropicalisis and online magazine racks

1503
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:29,280
Cover girl cutouts through a pop-a-beds infecting victims with silicone shredder

1504
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:34,280
World by past, your business, the point territory is now its rainy pornography lovers take shelter

1505
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:37,280
Post production, every time to pursue you and mask our chariot

1506
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:42,280
