1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Save my future.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Listen how is Adam Curry on the DSC 797?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
$60 million for the airplane scrapped my ass.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We don't need enough steam to get in.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I like to think I'm flying into the computer.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I guess it is Adam Curry.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You can continue to make great efforts.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Gosh!

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
God Manage Ass.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Tell me what's your identity.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
God Manning them, you're against the war.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
God Manning don't want anything.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Once it all, now we are the O.10X.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No, you can't take it, no, you can't take it

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Then the last one will be gone, not you can't do more

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Then you can't stand!

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now you can't talk!

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And now I've come for the one trying

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm going to get what you see, sir

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I bow down before the one you serve

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're going to get what you see, sir

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:06,000
OK, the money is nothing for the¡¥ky

26

Soulaines a coward, money's not one

29

Back so the rules that come, money's not the one to choose

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
No, you can't take it, no, you can't take it

Fountain, I'm before someone needs to

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You're going to get one to deserve

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Fountain, I'm before someone needs to

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're going to get one to deserve

Fountain, I'm before someone needs to deserve

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Alright, it's the evening of the debate in presidential debate

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
to take place about almost five hours ago

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If you've thought either one of those two candidates is

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
fit to be president of the United States, and we'll up fold

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
the Constitution of the United States

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
then念 you, you're going to get

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
what you deserve, nine inch nails has that message for you

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,500
it's for you and you better listen to it like goodness that was the

60
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,380
well that's an hour and a half of my life I will never get back again that was

61
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,180
horrible what a horrible horrible horrible show as you know I evaluate the

62
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,380
presidential debates based upon television entertainment value which is just

63
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,500
about the only thing they can be evaluated on because my god people please

64
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:20,180
these these guys they agree on everything they agree on saying nothing absolutely

65
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,940
nothing it was just and what an insult to the whole concept of a town hall

66
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:32,060
meeting give me a break it's a studio it's a studio with pre-selected people

67
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:37,360
with pre-selected questions with only two candidates of five or six who are

68
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,900
running in this presidential race you'll notice a couple things when Tom

69
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,340
broke off started off he did not say well actually first what he did say

70
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:51,580
was that this broadcast is sponsored by the committee for the presidential

71
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,780
debates look this committee up will you these are the people who will not

72
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,300
let any of the independence in on any of the debates as if you can only be

73
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,700
president of the United States if you're a Democrat or Republican sick of that

74
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:12,220
that's just wrong that's totally totally wrong in its unamerican and I'm

75
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,380
sure somehow I could figure it out to be unconstitutional and also notice the

76
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,940
Tom broke I didn't say no one has seen these questions prior to dot dot

77
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,540
dot of course because he knew the questions he knew who was going to ask

78
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,980
the questions and I'm pretty confident the candidates knew what the

79
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,220
questions were as well but this was not a town hall meeting that would

80
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,620
actually be entertaining let these guys answer questions have people

81
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,060
yelling stuff out in the audience that would actually be the American town

82
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,700
hall meeting I would like to see no please shut up sitting your seats and be

83
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,220
quiet well all of the studio audience actors will ask prepared questions

84
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,500
and the candidates will give prepared answers and try and run out the clock

85
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,300
my goodness what a travesty it's just all completely completely wrong

86
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,100
comments already coming in through this source code drop by the way it's episode

87
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,180
seven nine or seven of the data source code coming to you still from Northern

88
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,860
California from San Francisco you can hear I've got a real sign as a

89
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:18,740
blockage which although kind of nasty and not handy man it makes my voice

90
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,780
low I love that shit yeah I'm here from Portland and just got done

91
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:28,700
watching the presidential debates it is another steaming pile of horseshit

92
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:34,540
these two guys are the opposite sides of the coin and if you look carefully

93
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:40,420
at the coin the genomination is a mairou

94
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:47,660
big hair hope you win at home red hill love you mean no homo these guys

95
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:54,900
were what okay no they don't we're gonna vote their asses out and then they'll

96
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,060
work for us well I sure hope we're gonna we're gonna vote them out I mean you

97
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,260
almost say please don't vote because we don't want any of these two guys

98
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,460
winning you really don't I mean you really really don't for for different

99
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,220
reasons but also for a lot of the same reasons and they didn't talk about the

100
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,340
number one item on the agenda yet for two seconds about the financial crisis

101
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,580
the bailout the rescue package nothing about the theft that is taking place

102
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,700
before our very eyes all right I'm gonna get in all of that on today's

103
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,140
source code I am a little bit fried and I'm even more homesick than I was it's

104
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:36,300
now I'm as it two weeks been away from home and I'm missing the girls now I

105
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,740
think they're missing me too but they're busy they're their house hunting now

106
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,340
I tell them it's you're like five years too early don't do it yet

107
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,540
just referring back to the weekend show that I did and I wasn't quite sure how

108
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,260
it's gonna come across but I have to say most of the feedback was rather positive

109
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,940
I think that type of show at a lot of music a lot of soundtrack to my life

110
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,020
type stuff it really only works if it's released on a weekend you can chill out

111
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,940
as I suggested in the beginning you know you should even probably just put it

112
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,460
on the speakers and put it on the background and just hang out read the paper

113
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,060
drink some coffee whatever you do on a Sunday afternoon and here's a piece of

114
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,740
audio feedback and I'm I'm playing it because I'm really happy that this

115
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,220
stuff works you know you put a couple songs together you try and tell a story

116
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,580
through other artists work and you come up with them you know yeah can you

117
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,180
can hit a nerve sometimes it's cool hello I'm it's Luke here this time not as

118
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:35,220
the candy man but just as my own little me I just want to give some feedback

119
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:42,060
on DSC 796 I thought it was an excellent episode really a monumental episode

120
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:47,700
and of course giving detailed audio feedback would require a completely

121
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:54,180
separate answer show and I'm not sure I'm ready to do that yet so just some

122
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,940
some small bits and pieces here and for me it was kind of a really a deep

123
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,020
experience almost because today was actually quite a nice day here so I

124
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:10,980
decided to walk to the to the beach by the way Luke lives in Finland at the

125
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,700
beach in Finland must be nice this time of year and at the same time listen

126
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:21,020
to the DSC and so I was sitting there on a small pier at the beach you know

127
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:26,060
overlooking the sea listening to the waves watching the birds pass by and so I

128
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:31,220
also got in a kind of similar melcolic feeling or mood that similar to what

129
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,900
you were in so it was kind of a very very interesting experience to listen to

130
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:43,180
this DSC and the yeah the part has really kind of put me into the right mood

131
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,380
or wrong mood however you want to see it was the part with Johnny Cash because

132
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,060
well without yeah that was awesome that Johnny Cash do the the get his

133
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,420
burger dress I just posted on curry.com by the way as kid the kid looks like

134
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,900
three years old is sitting in a high chair he's reciting the get his

135
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,620
burger dress and there's some subtitles there because he messes up some of the

136
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,100
words but it's so cute and he seems to be having fun saying it I mean he

137
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,020
maybe he is a reincarnation of a of a blink and but you got to see that a

138
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,500
curry dot com links in the show notes of course always a daily source code

139
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,420
dot com so yeah indeed Johnny Cash for studying the get his burger dress

140
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,220
was deep for me too man for different reasons I'm not quite sure what you

141
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,380
got with Johnny Cash but for me he is the man in black he is another one of

142
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,900
those true Americans for good or bad that's what we are I'll go into too much

143
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,460
details he has actually been very important to to me so it's it was kind of

144
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:42,820
very very special coincidence of things that you put together in the show

145
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:49,660
for me personally so yeah really really very very very very special show and

146
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:56,100
I would say so I hope we can expect more of the same quality and I gotta tell you

147
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,660
it took me like five or six hours to prep that show so I don't know if I'm going to

148
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,380
do those too often and of course there's all kinds of legality issues but you

149
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,780
never hear that shit on the radio anymore where do you hear ELO with the news

150
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,980
you know you never hear songs like that anymore which is a shame but that's just

151
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,820
what commercial media has become so we've got to bend the rules once and

152
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,900
while under the auspices of course of the organization for the preservation

153
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:26,380
to the soundtrack of our lives and under the fairness and fair use act this

154
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:32,100
purely educational not for profit at least most of the time it's not that show

155
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,060
wasn't for profit there you go that makes it easy but I also would hope is that

156
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:40,580
people who from now on dial in to give feedback wouldn't only say how great the

157
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:46,220
show us or or how right you are and etc etc but I do like to know that all

158
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,300
these people are going to do themselves to you know if they feel that things are

159
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,460
wrong or not going in the right way what they are going to do themselves to

160
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,180
change the situation so I don't need much more valuable than everybody

161
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,660
just saying that oh great show and I'm the fantastic and then yeah let's

162
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,580
stuff so yeah you're right and then pop open a beer and maybe a diet

163
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:12,500
Coke slug down some as per tame and watch some TV here in America we're

164
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,020
watching football that's right who gives a shit who gives a shit you're right

165
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,100
great show I'm gonna have another beer that's right absolutely look and I

166
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,780
wouldn't mind hearing from the chuckleheads what you're doing and it can be

167
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,020
anything from just helping other people to awaken to what's going on around

168
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:32,140
them to actually undertaking action even if you're just voting or if you have

169
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,260
voted let me know let us know what are you doing we need to hear the action I

170
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,140
totally agree look good on I think we can all improve a little bit on that so I

171
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:44,780
don't have the answer yet because I'm not not yet fully fully convinced of

172
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,340
all the things you are saying but that would as I said that would require totally

173
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:56,020
separate long audio feedback show to go through in detail and well I'm

174
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:01,300
perhaps not not that interested to do that now but so thanks for this episode it

175
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,620
was great and keep the good stuff coming talk to you later bye all right man

176
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,900
and so I become more and more convinced that the reality is just so

177
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:16,380
completely different from you know from truth I guess is what we'd call it but

178
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,620
really is taking place because there is something going on there is something big

179
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,300
going on it's the mountain that you don't see on the map when you're about to

180
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:30,900
fly right into it it happens to the best aviators witness Steve Fossett who I

181
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,060
don't think there's any conspiracy there I think the poor guy poor basser

182
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,540
just slammed to the mountain it could be a whole number of things that's a

183
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,460
different story different topic but let me just talk for a second about the

184
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,300
daylight fiasco because this will kind of be gone for the next 24 hours in the

185
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,140
new cycle everyone will be talking about the debate and who won and who lost

186
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,220
and but but but and who was stronger and who's who has more experience and

187
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,300
who has this and who has they was more charisma

188
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,140
heightenest fake stupid I mean they could have at least made the set look like

189
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,300
it was a town hall it looked it was freaking bleachers in front of blue a blue

190
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:12,940
wall dumb huge disappointment so the Dow uh wound up a down 500 points

191
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,980
again today you can bet your ass the so-called plunge protection team is in

192
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,900
their work and that's the uh the uh this is something Ron Paul talks about

193
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:27,740
uh Congressman Ron Paul talks about the um the president's working group on

194
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,220
financial markets is the official name and you can go ahead and look it up

195
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,500
in Google it you'll find out about it but you won't find out that much as Dr.

196
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,660
Ron Paul says you can learn more about the CIA than you can about this working group

197
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:45,020
who basically take money and go in and manipulate the markets the whole thing is rigged

198
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,740
it's rigged that's how it blew up and how everything got inflated by being rigged

199
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:55,820
and it's uh it's being rigged as we speak it should actually probably drop a good

200
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:01,500
2,000 points more than it is right now if it wasn't being rigged you know meanwhile

201
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,940
I'm just gonna run down a couple stories here and uh and just talk through it there's no

202
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,860
way to even put it into sequence what's happening right now but it's really it's a

203
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:14,220
lot more important than the stupid debate keep your eye on the ball because something really

204
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,660
fricking fishy is going on here so first of all I mean the thing that you know the elephant

205
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,780
to the room is that no one is saying well shit they're saying work and because the dows

206
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,860
tumble and what's happening of course when it goes up then we say oh the economy's improving

207
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,780
when it's going down we don't say immediately oh the economy sucks and we're blowing up

208
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:37,340
we're imploding that's when we just whoa and we'll just be quiet then for a second

209
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,260
this by the way is the bill that both Obama and McCain voted for

210
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:49,740
both of them traders I call them out as traders because that's what they are participating in

211
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,540
this huge theft and it's not like they don't know what's going on both of them have taken over

212
00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:00,300
20 million dollars and donations from Wall Street firms don't you see it don't you see the huge

213
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:07,180
conflict of interest there both of them and then uh AIG which is the company that you and I

214
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:14,140
own 79% of the the insurance group that got caught up in the credit default swaps through their own

215
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:22,620
doing through their own greed and excess and and by the way I think that that wasn't even

216
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:27,100
that may not have even been a necessary takeover we may know in 20 or 30 years from now

217
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:36,460
gotta hope I live to see that these these executives who you and I own they took a half a million

218
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:44,220
dollar uh junk it out uh to a California resort to going talk about stuff fuck you get some

219
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:50,620
coffee and sitting your freaking cubicle cocksucker take in my money that's just a small example

220
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,820
there's so much going on that we'll never know about in the meantime the United Kingdom is melting

221
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:01,660
down complete meltdown of the banking system now the third bank that I had do business with the

222
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:13,020
Royal Bank of Scotland is going down the tubes I only have a couple left and what's excuse me

223
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,140
what's crazy to watch right before our very eyes is the meltdown of the European Union may I

224
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,900
remind you this started as the European Commonwealth you know the Commonwealth it's an economic

225
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:29,580
agreement kind of like NAFTA you know that's what it started out as and you know over time it took

226
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,100
some years there then all of a sudden well hey wait a minute we're all using the same money

227
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:38,380
wait a minute now we're a financial system we've got a parliament now making up laws central laws

228
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:45,260
that we can barely do anything about and crazy as stupid laws are talking about maybe regular they're

229
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:51,820
open to discussion about uh editorial charters and other regulations for web logs these are people

230
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,780
that are going to take your freedom away your absolute ultimate freedom of speeches is about to disappear

231
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,380
so we went from you know the people thinking hey we're kind of working together to make sense I don't

232
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,180
mind you know we have the same money yet to smart idea hey wait a minute now now we got all these rules

233
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,460
and who's making these freaking rules what's going on with that but it fell apart because everyone

234
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,860
all of a sudden decided whatever they wanted to do with their own banking system you know Ireland

235
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,140
guaranteed all deposits the Netherlands doubled their deposits uh Germany said oh we'll guarantee

236
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:28,940
everything even though it's a trillion dollars they couldn't get it together Napoleon excuse me sarcosi

237
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:36,220
freaking out you know there's a lot of crap going down and that just shows how uncordinated it all

238
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,580
is they're not really working together they're working against each other it's every man for

239
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,300
himself and the United States is going to get the blame for this they already kind of have it's a

240
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:50,700
well the credit crisis that started in America now has has infected other parts of the world yeah sure

241
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:56,860
I mean we're trading the same worthless paper and by the way in the United States

242
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:05,500
the average house price at its peak rose up to about four point five times the income of the

243
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:11,340
barber of the owner of the person who got a mortgage in the United Kingdom it's over six times the

244
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:19,180
average income you know this is you this is not this is not America doing this is you guys doing it

245
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,740
to yourself I know how the property ladders work and everyone's going nuts and getting on the

246
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,220
ladder and trying to make money and it was a sense sold to you as a good investment vehicle

247
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,900
and it could never go down until or it's only going up this is you know this is your own governments

248
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:40,540
doing this and of course it's a completely intertwined banking system and I'm going to get to that

249
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,300
because we're going to see some interesting moves and mark my words this is really going to happen

250
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:51,740
I'm convinced of it now oh by the way the truth the people truly at fault of course are

251
00:20:52,300 --> 00:21:02,060
bastard poor people who didn't repay their mortgages I'm have funny this is a

252
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,780
Lehman brothers I think is really is getting a big part of the blame for this and it's all a setup

253
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:15,820
it's so obvious I was watching c-spam and it was a committee on financial and banking affairs

254
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:23,100
a huge panel of senators and congressmen I think maybe a senators and I forgot all the names

255
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:28,220
and then they had these like economic experts we'll give there to give some witness testimony

256
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,260
I wasn't really blown away by them and I started watching this and so the the chairman opens up

257
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,100
it just like a five-minute statement and then before you can even do anything else some other guy

258
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,900
two two seats down says hey you know I'd like to make an opening statement and the chairman says

259
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,140
now you can't do that this is important man I think we should be talking about what's

260
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,580
everyone should have the chance here on this panel to make an opening statement and I want that to be

261
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,620
on the record chairman says you can't do it it's not in the rules to get the rule books calls for

262
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:01,660
parliamentarian inquest whatever not quite sure how that works but basically means get the rule book

263
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:08,220
ref no he was denied and then the guy says and this is this is a United States representative

264
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,540
I don't know if it was the senator of the house says but there's a big conspiracy there's a

265
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:18,220
cover up going on here and he was stifled and I'm pretty sure and I'm gonna find out who this guy

266
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:23,660
is I got it probably go to c-spamjunky.org I got guys got all the cool stuff I'm pretty sure that

267
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,700
he was going to say you know what this is bullshit this is absolute bullshit you know leave

268
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:39,180
in brothers is just take in the fall that's what's going on then these guys man they're all

269
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:45,660
jibronies look at Barney Frank he's like your cookie uncle and this guy's in charge of everything

270
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:53,900
and and and and and and helped ram through this bill which Obama and McCain both signed both

271
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,740
traders truly wall street shills this is where their money coming from if they'll do this to you

272
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:07,500
they'll do anything to you because they're blowing up our currency completely pulling the plug on the

273
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:19,260
dollar now um treasury secretary Paulson former CEO of Goldman Sachs a billionaire I might add

274
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,940
guys a billionaire and it's just this is public record this information you know guys a billionaire

275
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:34,300
he's now pulled in I love this guy's name cash curry or cash and carry is what I'm gonna call him

276
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:42,380
from now on what's his uh Neil Neil cash and carry Neil to the cash and carry former vice president

277
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,340
Goldman Sachs current assistant secretary of international fairs of the U.S. treasury he will

278
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:54,060
become the interim head of the seven hundred billion dollar rescue package of course he has nothing

279
00:23:54,060 --> 00:24:00,300
to do with a hundred and fifty billion of pork that was shoveled in there God that makes me so angry

280
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:07,500
well here is you know and I was on Twitter throughout the debate just looking what people were

281
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:15,340
saying I'm at least you know I only follow me a couple hundred people if that and uh the the things

282
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,980
that people are getting outrages about particularly about stuff McCain would say really angry

283
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:25,580
you know where is this anger for the action you know I'll man for the actual theft going on

284
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:30,780
it was so funny I was talking to the lady Patricia and uh and then she's you know she

285
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,700
at a certain point she gets bored of me talking about this shit as you can imagine she'll just change

286
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,740
the topic but we were actually talking about something else and then she said oh man that O.J. he's uh

287
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:45,980
man what a bastard he's they got him now and I and I said I don't care she's yeah be it he deserves

288
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,780
it said you know what I'm more interested in the actual thieves the real murderers who are acted

289
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,900
this is going to murder people when when when the really comes down to it people are going to

290
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,780
die on the streets not like they're not dying already well have a walk in San Francisco have a walk

291
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,340
around twenty five percent of these people by the way our veterans you don't give a shit about them

292
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:18,620
as a country uh shamed the entire country of Iceland is going broke now it's not a huge

293
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:25,420
population but uh kind of a chilling uh I think it's a microcosm of what could happen in any other

294
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,300
country by the way I believe it might happen the United Kingdom first dear Adam this came in on

295
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:37,100
the drop drop dotio dotio slash daily source code today I've been credit crunched half my savings

296
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,740
were with the lunch bonski i save operation a modest amounts since I just thought I'm just

297
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:47,980
out of college but I've been saving almost one third of my net income ever since ironically today

298
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,660
the British government raised the maximum guarantee amount to fifty thousand pounds however the

299
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:59,020
first twenty thousand euros of savings fall under the common E.E.A. minimum guarantee and I'll have

300
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,940
to take it up with the Icelandic financial services authority who supposedly only has 88 million euros

301
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:10,300
to secure a thirteen billion alternatively the government could jump in but they appear to be on the

302
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:15,580
verge of bankruptcy themselves so here's why it's ironic the increased British guarantee is good news

303
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:22,060
for people with savings between sixteen and fifteen sixteen and fifty thousand pounds I on the other

304
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:28,140
hand will have to rely on the goodwill of Russia or Scandinavia to get any money back tell me

305
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:34,220
then how current policy protects the common man or woman and their interests my guess is and I

306
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,060
have no proof whatsoever to back this up that there must have been at least some communication

307
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,940
between governments the timing of this increase is just too good I seriously doubt that they

308
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:51,980
really do work for us reganna broke in Iceland yeah well there's a lot to be said about Iceland

309
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:58,380
specifically because you know Iceland did did really enjoy all the upside and the fact the

310
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:04,380
entire population enjoyed it I think there are more people there have bemas and other luxury vehicles

311
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:13,980
than anyone else but yeah and here's an out of college person and saves up a third of

312
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:24,780
the net paycheck and gets screwed but not you know but just just before the rest of Europe starts to change things

313
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,660
of course it's all rigged this is what the whole interest rate is why do you think interest rates are

314
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:37,740
raised and lowered it's to expand and contract the economy it's you know it's almost like it's like

315
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:45,660
formula one okay so in formula one or we can say NASCAR doesn't matter or football or baseball

316
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:50,620
and with football I'll say American football but also soccer in fact FIFA great example of this

317
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:59,260
if you own the entire game if you own the franchise then you always win no matter what happens

318
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:06,460
and this money is a zero sum game if you're in on Europe and I include the UK with that and you're in

319
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:11,580
the Asian market and you're in the US market the money's flowing back and forth it's going somewhere

320
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:16,380
it's going from A to B you're always going to win and that is what the true owners of this earth are

321
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:22,940
doing they own the game they're just laughing they're playing with us at this point just messing with you

322
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:29,580
and of course economics and fear comes into it and shitty stupid stuff happens what's next of

323
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:35,020
course is our states in the United States are going bankrupt we're gonna see countries you know

324
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:43,340
it's you have a country 350,000 people now a California this came in also on the drop

325
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,740
I'm reading the third copy of a letter sent to my third neighbor already who's received this

326
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:52,940
from the California home owners and rent her assistance program it is notifying them that the

327
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:58,780
funds for the 2008-2009 homeowners and renters assistance program has been removed from the state

328
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:03,500
budget you can you've probably read about this watch nigger needs at least seven billion dollars

329
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:09,340
to be able to hit payroll you know and and what's the problem is states are very used to

330
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,300
financing through the credit markets and the money markets and they borrow money and it's based

331
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,900
against you know future tax revenues but when everything's frozen like it is now they can't

332
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:25,900
get access to money and you know what it actually will happen that government employees will not get paid

333
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,660
and you're not and well they don't come first of course

334
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:37,740
your homeowners and renters assistance program comes first this by the way it states is not a denial

335
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:44,540
of the claim the franchise tax board will hold the claim in case the funds become available for this

336
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:52,220
program so once again everyone stuck in in limbo the credit markets are still frozen

337
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:59,180
but the guys who did it paulson's buddies they're all out having a nice little retreat to

338
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:03,660
vacations and they got their money out and they're still going to have huge huge packages

339
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:10,940
and by the way if you make 350,000 or 500,000 dollars a year nice paycheck

340
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:18,700
with this field bad what's about zero you get zero until you turn that shit around anything will be

341
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:25,100
better than this jerk off that's happening right in front of us and what the whole point is

342
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,100
they're going to roll up all these banks that's on you already see the favorites it's good it's

343
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:36,140
gold but it's JP Morgan Bank of America I think city is going to get it up the butt they're going

344
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:41,820
to roll all these banks and it's going to be one bank and they're going to try and do it

345
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:52,060
and make it into one world government that is the ultimate ultimate goal so that all the money can

346
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,620
be arranged I mean it's not a lot easier and be a lot easier for the owners of the franchise don't

347
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:04,700
you think have all the money running all through one system well it's a pain in the ass to have

348
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:09,740
all those central banks I just make one big central bank you know by the way there's such a thing

349
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:15,580
as the world bank and the international monetary fund and the international bank of settlements all the

350
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:24,300
infrastructure is there regarding I just got to calm down regarding world government this is from

351
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:32,620
the global mail this is happening in Canada you'll love this preliminary talks between Canadian

352
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:39,660
and European officials will begin on October 17th at a summit in Montreal the province is

353
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:45,580
roll in the in the negotiations will be instrumental to the fate of the proposed massive agreement

354
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,620
which involves issues that primarily fall under their jurisdiction what are they talking about

355
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:58,540
a groundbreaking initiative on a scale that's never been attempted this is a um I'm looking for the

356
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:09,100
word here this is the plan to integrate the Canadian economy with the 27 nations of the European Union

357
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:15,180
okay that means you can work you can travel freely back and forth you get all those so-called

358
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:22,780
benefits I mean that's it's like Canada will become the next state in the European Union what the

359
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:30,300
hell is going on they're rolling it up you know I've run a roll up before so funny

360
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:37,900
think new ideas which was the company Ron Blumenide took public in the 96 and sold in 99

361
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,380
and which is still around today and still a profit mine I don't know if it's profitable this

362
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:48,940
very moment it wasn't till this crisis hit and I'm sure they're okay because that casha in the bank

363
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:57,820
but we started out with seven companies and we pulled their interests okay it's a it's a technical term

364
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:05,900
which meant we could uh I from the get-go we could account for everyone's revenue and yeah

365
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:11,900
we were doing about 15 16 million dollars a year and but it was all very different cultures in different

366
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,380
parts of the globe literally we rolled them all together we started the company we figured out how

367
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,020
to communicate we built an infrastructure before you knew it really was one company and it was

368
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:27,420
seven hundred people seven hundred fifty people they all had stock in the company

369
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:37,980
cranky this roll up is is disastrous and it's happening without you being even allowed to vote on it

370
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:45,500
Canadians okay so while all of all that's going on here's a more theft for you that you didn't

371
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,540
even hear about the Senate passed while it's not quite done yet but the seven the Senate passed a

372
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:56,620
six hundred and thirty four billion dollar spending bill which includes twenty five billion

373
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:05,100
for taxpayers subsidized loans that's for the auto industry oil companies got their lungs

374
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,580
they got the elimination of the longstanding ban on drilling off the Atlantic and Pacific coast but of

375
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:19,260
course most importantly where's the number 488 billion went to the defense department to go

376
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:30,620
kill people in other lands uh six percent more than even asked for your money my money

377
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,420
rich guys are taken it and it's not just a saying okay you know if something sounds too good to be

378
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:44,140
druid probably is and do a little bit of research because there's plenty of plenty of videos

379
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,780
out there on the internet you can even look at zeitgeist a denim just to see how the money system works

380
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:55,100
they're stealing they've stolen our money they're stealing our dignity it's really it's

381
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:03,020
an outrage and you should be outrages as well where's some of that anger and what are we going to

382
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:14,300
do about it well we can't even email or use their use the the Senate and and House of Representatives

383
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:19,980
websites because they they shut those down we want to really communicate I think we should just start

384
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:25,580
it maybe it's just a telephone call campaign and uh we've got to come up with some means and we've

385
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,820
got to get on the mainstream radio and television you know like how uh with Howard Stern there's

386
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:36,780
always some guy who'll say bubble boy it's kind of funny so we need a slogan like that they work for us they

387
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:47,100
should work for us that's not strong enough arrest them how about that arrest the thieves arrest the thieves

388
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:55,740
throw them in jail don't make our children do it we're responsible for this shit hey I want to say

389
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:03,340
hide everyone down under I know we got a pretty big chunk of audience in Australia apparently uh someone

390
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:08,860
got a cool plug for the daily source code on an Australian radio station I think it's ABC I

391
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:14,380
think it's the Australian broadcast corporation and apparently this program almost a million people

392
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:19,340
listen to it so let me just play that for you because I think it's pretty cool I'm proud of that

393
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,500
I and the hell of a bro and I'm being the top fella who does that they're not support for

394
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:30,620
the day we're talking about podcast um here's one hey Alan I'm totally at this podcast my recommendation

395
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,580
is Adam how he's daily source code and know it's in that they are great all sorts of

396
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:41,020
issues including technology politics conspiracy theories to warm do you think people like computers

397
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:52,380
you know what no I'm into different conspiracy theories in America most people believe in a

398
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:58,780
conspiracy theory or the it they'll tell you that the true conspiracy theory was a conspiracy of

399
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:05,420
guys who could barely fly a sess no 152 who hijacked three planes with box cutters and then

400
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,820
expertly flew them into the Pentagon the most protected building in the world

401
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:18,300
and oh and left no debris no nothing that's a conspiracy theory for you if someone told you

402
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:24,060
that story you'd be like shut up that's bullshit man that's a dumb story what's going to believe

403
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:30,140
that that makes no sense yeah that's the conspiracy theory read all about it in the 9 11

404
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:36,060
commission report anyway I'm sure some people from Australia tuned in after hearing that plug

405
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,700
so I just want to find out those guys where that's cool I appreciate it yeah I'm in the conspiracy

406
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:46,860
theories especially if they're the truth all right I want to take a little break here play you

407
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:55,580
something that showed up on Derek the Bandits podcast it's Derek the Bandits sound republic

408
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:02,380
which is like a a trans house mix show and I have no idea who did this mix but it's most of

409
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:09,980
the monologue from a daily source code uh seven 81 where I did the whole uh the whole thing about

410
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:17,340
a me being a multimedia hitman and uh I mean I'm just gonna take a break I'm gonna put the

411
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:23,500
kettle on while you listen to this uh most excellent remix it's a little trippy but it kind of works

412
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:37,020
check it out I think sort of noise but many old many old buzzing buzzing buzzing buzzing

413
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:50,060
all at the same time suddenly it just stopped it stopped as quickly as it had begun

414
00:38:53,580 --> 00:39:03,020
I'm coming for years of conversation that we've been having that's brought me to this point

415
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,980
many of you may feel the same some maybe afraid to speak out and fear of ridicule fear not

416
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:15,180
charcoal heads together we're going to face the future the light that is our destiny

417
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:23,340
welcome to the next level welcome to the awakening you wait I say it's uh in a six month

418
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:28,540
excursion but the process is actually something's been taking place my entire life imagine a

419
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:33,180
world when you wake up one morning only to realize that everything you believe it function

420
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,140
entirely differently from the way you're receiving in all of your life world in fact with the truth

421
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:45,820
is off the direct opposite of your reality I'm sorry is the top three kinds of top the top

422
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:52,460
four lines the power of rule and the power as in what makes our lights glow and keeps our vehicles moving

423
00:39:52,460 --> 00:40:01,580
individually collectively these dreams of our own system the intergenerator is that energy

424
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:09,100
innovation is stifled the universe in black hole the power to generate speed or energy and motion

425
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:15,180
based on what a CD illusion is for survival by the we know it is a strength because of the

426
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:20,700
context of you where the world is watching imagine show that for you it's leaving you love like

427
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:26,860
God or you're like you're waiting to take a radio while you're on your own now the rabbit hole

428
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:35,980
we enter up this program to bring you this new spot

429
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:01,900
the media program can create content that will make your brain react if we determine that

430
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:06,460
or if you really can to get how it works and you understand that if you come to it effective

431
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:13,180
what's your worth of code and even if you are if you need your personal super be your brand

432
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:18,060
that's how you've been ex-teaching with the podcast to do that and that's what you want

433
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:22,860
to do when you're planning to publish or the decades they've built up an impressive

434
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:30,620
current social and monetary systems that they control entirely all of the continued exploitation

435
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:39,500
of us special system however has one thing of law it must continue to grow in order for us to

436
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:48,460
find in these us the place to be in the get into it we're in the hospital what's our houses cars

437
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:55,180
and other true physical stuff they'll be no more meaning to content of money remember

438
00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:00,140
the numbers are she never been created at free energy that they hold everyone

439
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:05,580
I think we are about to discover it for ourselves thanks to the evolution of more speeds

440
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:12,780
I'm sure our DNA is being finally pre-proved to evolve and due to centuries of suppression

441
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:20,140
the internet was of course the at least big car come up that's it we get out of solid

442
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:27,340
we're going to sign a beautiful body we're going to have to wear this to our brains to make us

443
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:37,180
people and it's just a lot of friends you are very much asleep in the reality

444
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:44,780
free by the master's at home and if you are waiting seeing the truth lies with it it's so

445
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:51,180
good to tell you the least she is dreaming under the straightest self in the world

446
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:56,940
it's all my time she comes from the down and now must need to be waiting prepared to take

447
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:02,300
out you and actually my role to assist in your waiting that you can't even explain why

448
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:09,660
I can't now I don't see her again if I look crazy please hold on to the earth probably won't

449
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:14,220
come to the street you hold but things should not these are phoenix and landmastered relationships

450
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:19,580
where do I fear blackmail and harm should be phoenix anyway it's not like but I served in

451
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:26,700
not gonna rule any of the house for years of conversation and I just wanted to respond to the next

452
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:34,300
awakening

453
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:43,580
that's cool link in the show notes it did a source code dot com

454
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:52,780
awesome I like that okay go um I was just listening to that and talking about the energy

455
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:57,100
elite because of course that's really you know there's only a three real sources of

456
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:04,140
currency gold it will be one oil would be the other and of course the third one is drugs

457
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:10,860
and uh you know the government is involved in all of it particularly now Afghanistan oh by the

458
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:17,740
way I just want everyone you know just go back to the base for a second so do you not see the irony

459
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:26,380
in this bullshit war of words about when we're going to leave Iraq when at the same time the same

460
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:33,580
people both candidates that are on television are saying but you know we've got to go to Afghanistan

461
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:40,380
that's really important while the uh the high command the British high command the top dog over there

462
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:47,580
in the army says you can't win here yeah we know that the Russians tried it because we're not there

463
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:54,140
to go find bin Laden okay he will not be found he will not be killed because the minute that happens

464
00:44:54,220 --> 00:45:01,820
then the perception amongst the populace of the world would be the war on terror is over that's why

465
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:10,620
he'll never ever ever ever be at least portrayed as being killed captured etc never ever

466
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:19,100
just won't happen unless we unmask these fraudsters so we're talking about the energy elite

467
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:25,020
and uh how the force said they control the oil and uh and the flow and the price and the

468
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:32,300
currency that it can be traded in um but you know as we continue to explore own creative spirits

469
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:39,100
and we come up with more crazy ass things uh there's something that uh I don't know if uh this

470
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:45,340
this wasn't on the drop maybe someone emailed this to me it's the ram implosion wing god i like this

471
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:52,140
um and the opening paragraph which of course it catches my eye immediately after being rejected as

472
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:57,020
an x-priced this is the like the big google thing they do here and uh you know for space travel

473
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,860
after being rejected as an x-priced contestant for an unproven gravity

474
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:13,420
is it gravity thing propulsion concept and told repeatedly by the skeptics that my technology

475
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,980
goes against fundamental physics i realize that i needed a way of proving once and for all

476
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:23,660
that i had a viable technology so i decided to install the ram implow wing on the roof of my

477
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:33,100
van this is it's like a spoiler um but it's uh it's uh it's something with ram air and uh

478
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,940
well there's a link in the show notes of course and if you know for a piece of plot of course this

479
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:42,540
is a I'm sure that people are gonna call this out as a scam but apparently it does something with

480
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:46,780
the aerodynamics and i'm all for that so i'm just mentioning this is something to look into

481
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:51,180
not something i've tested at all and you know i'm a big believer in the hydroxy booster because

482
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:58,620
it actually works for me but people are seeing double the mileage and i'm you know i'm not

483
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:06,300
adverse to that that uh through some you know unthought of but yet looking at the pictures fairly

484
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:17,580
simple uh change to aerodynamics through this uh ram implosion wing that it actually might work

485
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:23,020
it seems to only work at uh higher speeds maximum efficiency between 1685 miles per hour

486
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:29,820
but then you can effectively be using half the amount of gas so tell me the look at

487
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:35,740
link in the show notes as i yeah as i said um see where i'm i've got to run down

488
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:40,780
we're only about halfway oh hey this is cool put an old buddy showed up all of a sudden

489
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:45,740
really surprising check it out who could that be

490
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:57,820
you know you know that you that he's the other bits of trouble that's right he's back

491
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:05,340
oh hello Roger hello i didn't Roger here so i had to send you any audio comments through

492
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:09,980
while no wait wait for a while Roger it's been like two years where you been

493
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:13,820
he's in the library and there was this straight to that copy and files of my phone on

494
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:18,700
so it's a he's tried downloading Paul and it's all machine possible but it's nice and he

495
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,340
will go again although your search changed quite a lot i mean this is a concern that he's

496
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:28,460
like a paranoid shit to print it with all your conspiracy theories never mind about red and blue

497
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:33,180
pills i think she just stopped taking any more pills and get out of it more and actually so i

498
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:38,460
changed into the x-files when i heard you like this you call it the daily source code with molder

499
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:44,300
and curry and there's only one of the blue pills you should take it actually that's uh no agenda

500
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:50,060
with uh with molder and scully curry and devour act no agenda dot mevio dot com

501
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,940
anger maybe thirty years time when the magic's gone and thirty-two what's the thing that you

502
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:59,500
should be paranoid about though is that you might be getting stitched up by doing a show by someone

503
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:04,940
you know is John Seed Borat you're probably not aware of the Borat film it's a man who did the

504
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:11,740
allergy show and he does press on celebrities such as yourself it's nice so it's time you record a show

505
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:16,540
try pulling his trousers down and say that he's wearing a line green man keeny oh i noticed a lot

506
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,300
seems to listen to she never wish me i'll send as they love you now i don't think it's

507
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,740
very fair that you let these call us get away with that because don't you remember the

508
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:27,820
time last year you're supposed to stop writing those letters as the same sentiment now

509
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:31,980
if they were allowed to send so will i i would just use words this time and not play with

510
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:37,580
right now and i love you Russia and i genuinely made that

511
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:58,220
that you saw all right as weird as ever but he's back good to have him back on the radar

512
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:06,140
Roger Smalls i presume still yeah he's really explained where he's been this is it's like bad

513
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:14,700
we were worried Roger a lot of people were worried okay of all the topics that uh that we've been

514
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:19,740
discussing uh over the past months in fact this next topic is something that has

515
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:25,020
opened up a huge conversation it gets the most response the most articles post that i get the

516
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:31,500
most email about it and the most emotional it's a very emotional issue this is about uh the hpv

517
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:38,060
virus and the vaccinations uh that are that have just popped up worldwide i've followed this uh just

518
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:44,220
caught my eye and i saw it happening everywhere um in the united kingdom continental europe in the

519
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:52,860
united states in south america um it is now a legal requirement that if you emigrate immigrate

520
00:50:52,860 --> 00:51:00,700
in the united states um you have it's a mandatory to get this uh hpv vaccination and it's

521
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:07,820
guardazil which is made by a huge pharmaceutical company murk now i have my own thoughts about

522
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:12,460
vaccination and let me separate a couple things there's some basic vaccinations which are

523
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:21,180
created a long time ago okay a polio being number one and these are very cheap um and i believe

524
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:29,340
in these it's proven technology and um for very deadly disease but it's it's a you know really

525
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:36,540
this is proven the the use of it the effectiveness of it and any side effects so those are the

526
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:43,900
basic ones but what's happened in the past 25 years is pharmaceutical companies had become completely

527
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:48,860
reliant upon these what they call the pipeline you can look up there they're quarterly

528
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:55,260
filings is a public companies go look at murk and Pfizer and uh amgen and these types of companies

529
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:00,060
and already they're they're predicting they're going to do billions billions with the b billions

530
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:07,580
of dollars on flu vaccinations you know send them even say for the avian bird flu so you know how

531
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,820
how can they put that in their pipeline they have to have the they have to have the virus to have

532
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:17,260
made the vaccine you know i i don't trust it and i don't trust them what they're doing with

533
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:21,260
our with our monies why the hell should i trust them with what they're injecting into our kids

534
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:28,220
and uh this there's just tons and tons of stories coming out now and uh people will say well look

535
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:32,860
you know here this is what the center for disease control says and so it must be true and

536
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:39,180
you know it's left and right and everyone has a has an opinion uh this one was left on the drop

537
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:48,940
it just freaked me out uh it's a it's a rather long post um title of it HPV vaccination in the

538
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:57,020
coercion of our 13 year old diabetic daughter uh so anyway these parents had uh ticked off the uh

539
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:04,140
no do not want the shot on the consent form this uh 13 year old girl was taken out of line

540
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:12,140
out of the or taken uh let me see if i can find it exactly and i'll be kind of good just so

541
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:21,340
freaky it's a long article uh here we go so this is the parents who are writing this we have no

542
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:26,780
overed moral spiritually issue with the immunization itself and along with the FRC which i'm not

543
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:32,780
sure what that is but well anyway there's a link uh we don't believe the HPV immunization necessarily

544
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:37,820
leads to promiscuity we do however have a problem with mandatory or coerced vaccination against

545
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,980
the will of the child or parents but we were told we could opt out so we didn't give it much thought

546
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:48,060
on the day of the vaccinations our 13 year old daughter who by the way was has type one diabetes

547
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:53,820
was taken aside from the other girls and told by the doctor she was the only girl in her uh

548
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:59,340
year in her class who had handed in a consent form with a cross in the no box as they started

549
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:06,300
to talk and without being asked if she wanted it the doctor jabbed her with the fricking vaccine

550
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:12,540
that's so you've got to read through this story and they've really done a lot of research and uh

551
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:20,540
and um you know they're obviously outraged and these are very expensive uh shots

552
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:26,380
and so my basic premise from what i've learned from the research that i've been doing and other

553
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:31,020
people have other research and can believe what you want but this is how i would uh operate

554
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:35,580
it for my own daughter i would not let her have this i would not let her be subjected to this

555
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:43,660
a it's not proven yet and we're going to get into that in a second um um and really on top of

556
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:47,660
that i don't trust them i don't know what the i don't know what else is in this guardazil

557
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,820
you hear a lot of stories they don't mind putting fluoride in the water

558
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:57,420
who knows what they're injecting directly and the way they're pushing this it's either for money

559
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:01,900
because it's a big money making scheme it's in their pipeline they've got to make the profit

560
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:08,060
and they could be rushing it through how many times haven't we seen uh medication that you know

561
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:14,700
is relatively new and it turns out to kill a lot of people you don't want your kids to be guinea pigs

562
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:22,620
we call a lot more about the polio vaccine in this guardazil and uh with us now Franco

563
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:29,820
from rock austytalia uh who's i've no Franco for years i don't know him personally um i did

564
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:34,060
know that he was uh a doctor although he's never really talked about it on the show but he also

565
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:39,500
he actually turned me on to using ableton live he helped me uh with the first set up of that and uh

566
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:45,260
so i trust this guy when he says stuff and i want you to listen what Franco has to say about HPV

567
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:51,180
and uh guardazil and of course we have to hide his true identity because in this effect he's

568
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:55,660
he's actually working as a true whistleblower because what he's about to tell you is illegal in Italy

569
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:01,340
here's a Franco from rock austytalia hi Adam i'm not familiar from Italy i think you remember

570
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:06,620
me from the best rocking podcast here in Italy but i don't want to disclose too much of my

571
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:12,780
personal info because you know here in Italy uh medical doctors i'm a medical doctor medical

572
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:19,740
doctors aren't allowed by low to speak on public media about medical subjects what about censorship

573
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:25,020
yeah dude come over to america the on television we're advertising a pill for anything

574
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:30,620
hey is your wife not so hot anymore take this it'll make your dick hard oh do you

575
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:36,780
are you fat here take this it has a nice name like soft and easy but basically it makes you shit

576
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:47,740
we're crazy here we're crazy not but this this thing is too big i'm so proud you start

577
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:55,420
exposing all the bad things from a surgical industry is our uh pushing over normal people and i see

578
00:56:55,420 --> 00:57:01,180
you lack some medical expertise on on the subject yes exactly and this is what i always want i

579
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:07,580
always want people who know what they're talking about i want you to call in go to daily drop.io

580
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:13,420
slash daily source code um leave a note there's a voice mail number you can call and it'll show

581
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:17,660
right up and everyone else can listen to it in case i don't get to it on the show it's it's the way

582
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:21,260
we're communicating with each other and i love it when people who know what they're talking about

583
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:28,060
coming and help us out from co-continue so i think i can be of some help to the chocolates to have

584
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:36,380
some knowledge about this subject uh i i could speak about these for our but let's start from the

585
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:45,420
basic basic stuff what is guardazil and what is HPV HPV is not a virus HPV is a class of viruses there are

586
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:56,060
more than 70 HPV viruses known um they are very very common there are uh estimate that uh at least

587
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:05,100
90% of the normal population get infected by some kind of HPV virus during their life but only

588
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:14,620
a little part of these developed cervical cancer um of this 70 plus some kind species of HPV

589
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:23,180
viruses only six are linked to the cervical cancer and this link is very very weak it's just a

590
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:29,500
statistical link uh now you pay attention to this he's talking about a statistical link he's talking

591
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:37,260
about the actual link between uh cervical cancer and six strains of this HPV really important

592
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:42,380
stuff you listen because it's not empirical proof it's statistical proof guardazil that's like

593
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:49,980
like television ratings and other boxing like guardazil there there are that are under development

594
00:58:49,980 --> 00:59:01,340
right now uh give immunization protection only against three or four of these six uh dangerous HPV

595
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:11,340
viruses so uh the power of guardazil to prevent cervical cancer is already limited by design

596
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:19,900
but there's more there's more what is this link how can we tell that HPV causes cervical cancer

597
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:28,060
we don't know we have just some very optimistic guesses um the now there you go that's

598
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:33,340
how I'm looking for guesses okay we're guessing that we should inject your kid with this just

599
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:39,340
the guess the statistical evidence please nothing to see here move along the main study that is used

600
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:49,500
to link HPV to cervical cancer showed that 85% of women who have cervical cancer also have

601
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:57,900
an infection from one of these six kinds of HPV and it's 85% it's not 100% and you will see that

602
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:04,220
it's very very important there are ladies that have cervical cancer but have no HPV infection

603
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:15,580
what this study didn't tell us and what scientists have no clue about is if this infection is the real

604
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:21,900
of the cervical cancer there you go so we don't even know if it's the actually the cause of the

605
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:29,340
cervical cancer but maybe just in case at 500 bucks a pop we'll just inject everyone while we're at

606
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:38,220
it worldwide in many cases mandatory this is what it's come to they're making money off our children

607
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:42,780
if they're not throwing them in the desert and having them killed by hot lead and depleted

608
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:48,700
uranium and god knows what else they're injecting shit into them right here at home and kids are

609
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:58,940
getting sick and dying read the stories google it or if it's just an opportunistic infection

610
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:07,900
that is a virus that finds a good home to live in a tissue which is already weakened by the cancer

611
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:17,020
or by the real causes that made the cancer possible did you know this is the the population

612
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:26,220
exposed to this kind of arguments not at all what mainstream media tells the people is what

613
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:31,340
please is the pharmaceutical industries yeah let me just say one more thing about that I was watching

614
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:38,860
a USA network they had a house marathon I like that show that's a that guy has humor

615
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:45,980
I like it that's right funny it's my kind of humor and there was a whole episode about vaccinations

616
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:52,700
it was so clear that they were communicating that you need to get your vaccinations

617
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:58,380
because they even had a mom who wouldn't do that and the whole episode was about vaccinations multiple

618
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:05,420
story lines that's what the mainstream media is doing and you know what low and behold there

619
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:13,020
were all kinds of pharmaceutical company advertisements in that show g you think huh but I want to

620
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:20,060
tell you about one more thing that is of the utter most important about this subject and this

621
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:27,100
postulate cock was the guy who discovered the cause of tuberculosis he's the father of modern

622
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:35,900
microbiology and he wrote four laws which are the the basis of all modern microbiology and that are

623
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:45,180
used to say if a virus or if a microorganism is the cause of a disease you will see that two of these

624
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:53,260
four laws are just not true for HPV and cervical cancer so let's so there you go so in order for it to

625
01:02:53,260 --> 01:03:02,140
be a complete picture and in order for everything to be linked and to be in balance and to be

626
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:09,020
you know a vaccination on the level of tuberculosis apparently it has to adhere to at least those

627
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:16,860
four furloughs and only hits to them so again it's just an indication it's statistical evidence

628
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:24,220
not empirical evidence and it's clearly a money scam while they're injecting shit that makes our

629
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:31,340
kids sick the first postulates they say that the virus must be found in abundance in all

630
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:38,540
people suffering from the disease but not in empty people and we saw before that this is not through

631
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:45,900
and the third postulate that says that the the the virus you you isolate the virus then you

632
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:53,420
inoculate that into an healthy person and this person must develop the same disease

633
01:03:53,420 --> 01:04:02,620
that's why the two inoculate HPV to a healthy person or to an healthy animal and discovered that

634
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:09,260
this person or this animal they've developed the the cervical cancer oh no I disagree with you

635
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:14,540
there respectfully Franco they're doing it right now they're just waiting for someone to develop

636
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:19,340
cervical cancer they're testing this shit in our kids as we speak they're doing it they're

637
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:23,980
not collating them they're injecting them with the virus and well let's see maybe they'll develop

638
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:28,780
cervical cancer then we'll know oh well wait a minute then that's actually causing it

639
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:37,260
but it probably won't but they are getting sick joint pain seizures death in 20 cases documented

640
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:47,500
so you I think you just started to see the truth if you want to know more I have a lot

641
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:53,260
a lot of information about this stuff it's my job and I'm very happy to share it with fellow chocolate

642
01:04:53,740 --> 01:05:00,140
okay that's all for now bye bye and did they work or should be working for us Franco my friend

643
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:05,580
from rock castitali I thank you so much of course we were hungry for knowledge we want to know more

644
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:11,580
we were you know and I know you I know you're busy but if you have a chance look at drop.io slash

645
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:16,940
daily source code that's where you can see a lot of people checking in with articles and

646
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:25,100
a contrarian views any information about the about this and other vaccinations man I have so many

647
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:31,100
questions I'd like to know about fluoride in the water I'd like to know how do we know that what's

648
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:39,100
in guardazil isn't there aren't other harmful elements in there for us why does our US government

649
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:43,900
to say it's okay to have melamine in products you know doesn't that isn't that like plastic

650
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:49,980
you know this kind of stuff so many medical questions Franco so many medical questions are we

651
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:55,180
not killing ourselves by eating junk stuff that doesn't even qualify as food that you wouldn't

652
01:05:55,180 --> 01:06:03,660
even feed the pigs yeah these are the questions I have now we're truly fucked in the UK man this

653
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:08,540
is a big one this is huge I can't believe that this is just kind of slipping under the radar

654
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:18,380
this is from the mail the mail in the UK oh my gosh so there's a lot of people who garden

655
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:29,500
in the UK and they've been using this manure and it's apparently it's not in just one brand

656
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:37,500
of manure but it's in ten different brands of manure and what's happened is so this is basically

657
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:44,940
horseshit or cow shit or whatever kind of shit but these animals have been eating grass that

658
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:55,740
have been treated with the same weed killer and this weed killer is um oh my it has a has a

659
01:06:55,740 --> 01:07:04,300
technical name and I looked it up uh Wikipedia had a couple of links um what's the name of it uh

660
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:15,020
amino parolid amino parolid I think the hormone-based herbicide that first came onto the market in 2005

661
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:20,460
and is used to control docks thistles and nettles in a pasture without harming the grass itself

662
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:27,420
so that's great so now we have these pastures this is all the genetic and you know this is the

663
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:32,860
shit Montsanto is into as well with the seeds so they try to create stuff that you know will

664
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:36,540
kill certain kind of plants but not other kinds of plants certain kinds of insects

665
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:43,420
not other kinds of insects now totally modifying nature and here's what happens so the the weeds are

666
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:48,460
killed but the grass is green the cows and the horses they eat this they shit it out and then it's

667
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:56,700
used as compost as as manure uh for people growing vegetable gardens and the shit is not growing

668
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:08,700
let me tell you this is um Susan Garrett uh listen to her potatoes they were tiny the leaves were

669
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:20,300
brown misformed stuff dying not not even not even growing it's been going on for two years

670
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:26,940
in fact you can't use no three years almost four years and and if ground has been uh if the soil

671
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:35,580
has been contaminated by this shit literally that stays in the ground for two years you can't grow any

672
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:46,780
vegetables or anything this is bad this is really really really bad contaminated manure how did

673
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:52,620
this happen who I mean isn't someone supposed to be watching out for this and testing it

674
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:04,300
you've got to read this article I'm just scrolling through it right now this is so bad

675
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:13,020
dow aggro sciences you know dow chemical those guys and they have not withdrawn the product

676
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:20,540
still on the market still being used I hope this gets out far and why you really got to post this I

677
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:25,820
mean can you imagine having a vegetable garden and and you know so what else has this been been

678
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:33,900
been used for what and and these animals so they're eating poison and it's killing crops

679
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:40,140
we've got this is the stuff we have to stop you know let that be a mission for a couple chuckle

680
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:46,860
heads out there let's stop this this nonsense idiocy can't grow anything in these gardens and

681
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:57,820
on this soil for two years all right gonna wrap it up just quickly with uh going back to

682
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:04,780
US politics for a second Adam this is Michael calling from Chicago of the upper now podcast

683
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:07,900
up or now dot luck spot dot com name like an out of the show about opera

684
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:14,860
good stuff interesting that getting it's talking real people in the business talking about it swearing

685
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:20,380
the love I'm talking calling you that's kind of cool though that opera show

686
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:27,580
and you should listen to it is not bad about this election Obama McCain you know I like McCain I

687
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:35,260
remember I think they're both good people in general and heart but you know after this bill was

688
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:41,340
passed the bill they couldn't pass for 700 but it's a steel a 140 when it's a hundred and sixty

689
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:51,020
billion dollars in torque in earmarks which is exactly the bullshit that McCain and Obama were

690
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:57,500
both complaining about and saying they were going to change and you know I and sometimes

691
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:02,780
you got to dance with the devil and some things have to get done but for neither of them to

692
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:10,140
say anything about this and say we're passing it because of this reason you know it's bullshit

693
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:15,260
they offered no explanation they didn't say anything about it it's bullshit yeah they're both full

694
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:20,700
of crap yeah listen out of my love your show I listen to it every episode that comes out

695
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:28,460
I think in a lot of ways you're a whack job I think you're a whack I appreciate that I am going

696
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:36,220
with uh, McCain I'm going with run balls endorsement uh Paul was the only one who saw any

697
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:44,860
of this happening uh predicting it several years ago and uh being right about that certainly

698
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:50,380
yeah I'll I'll tell you uh Cynthia McKinney I think that's uh it's a she's a really good alternative

699
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:57,420
for a number of reasons uh and the top one being at least she's sincere all of these independent

700
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:03,580
candidates they're sincere okay and they talk about real issues about the real problem and they're

701
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:08,380
they're not you know they're not bullshitting because look this is this is the whole problem

702
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:13,260
they have no money because they they speak the truth this is why I got kicked off the radio in in

703
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:18,060
Holland because I was telling the truth and the finance people didn't like it and they were going

704
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:23,100
to pull the plug out of the radio station so they uh you know they don't like it and they uh that

705
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,860
that means no money now I don't need their money but of course I didn't get the you know

706
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:30,620
than the show ends so these people because they're speaking the truth they get no money because

707
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:35,260
they have no money they can't really have the same uh presence in the mainstream because that's

708
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:40,940
where all the money goes to for advertising mainly and uh to create viral ads and have a campaign

709
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:46,940
look Obama's you know it's a quarter of a billion dollars no shit I mean it's uh it's a big

710
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:52,860
ass deal and uh McKinney not quite that much but it's hundreds of millions of dollars look at those

711
01:12:52,940 --> 01:13:03,580
planes just that alone so that's why you know that's why uh that's why uh those independent

712
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:09,660
candidates are uh are pretty good good to look at for sure now we're not gonna have time the you know

713
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:15,340
this is it's all coming too fast too furious um and of course the question is if we'll even

714
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:19,740
have elections at all but that's uh I don't want to really delve into that right now it's a possibility

715
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:26,380
I guess with everything that's happening if people get pissed off and uh and when we pull out

716
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:33,980
the pitch forks something's got to change that's the kind of change we really need don't get fooled

717
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:40,700
okay Michael continue a lot of it is you're not right I don't think I don't think aliens are coming to visit us

718
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:47,580
and I don't think that's not enough you know uh I'm hopeful October 14th man if it's really true

719
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:54,540
that the first contact is coming and know that there would be some actual hope for actual change

720
01:13:55,580 --> 01:14:00,940
it would be nice you know I'm not I look I have no way to prove this I'm not one of these people

721
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:08,700
who runs around saying uh it's gonna happen it's gonna happen I'm way open for it though so uh don't worry

722
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:13,180
you guys can forget about that I got my eye on all the extraterrestrial stuff if anything pops

723
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:18,620
all that you know obviously you know there's all kinds of information coming in all kinds of

724
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:27,020
information um but uh until I can bring you something really good I'm just gonna shut up about it

725
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:36,620
but at least we all know that uh that I'm uh open for Evan was a conspiracy uh but um no no nine

726
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:42,460
eleven was a conspiracy okay you can have your conspiracy which is that a couple of guys who

727
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:52,140
couldn't fly sessness hijack three aircraft four aircraft with box cutters flew them into

728
01:14:52,140 --> 01:15:00,860
heavily protected buildings the amazing uh airmanship overpowered uh in some cases military crew

729
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:08,860
no wreckage no luggage no bodies that's a conspiracy theory then you know what that is a conspiracy theory

730
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:14,780
off Obama and McCain they're both they're both foolish shit but we kept it talk about who we

731
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:20,220
had a change everything we're gonna change good out the pork especially McCain though Obama said it

732
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:29,180
as well and bullshit absolutely bullshit do we really need to make arrows cheaper to make for

733
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:35,260
student archers that really with this oh god it's bullshit it's all bullshit and now it's probably

734
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:41,740
not even gonna do anything no no I but I told you it wasn't gonna do anything yeah oh it did

735
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:47,660
something it just gave all those decwads uh a way out there money they're punching out they've

736
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:52,700
got you know they've got huge places in paraguay that the whole bush compound is there that's

737
01:15:52,700 --> 01:16:01,340
we're gonna be safe paraguay but not me wherever I am I'm standing my ground better believe it

738
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:08,780
we all got to do that and we got to band together that's the big one um you're sure you've

739
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:12,700
heard of dividing conquer what's taking place I'm seeing it taking place right here in these

740
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:21,980
United States not unlike it so oh god well be man you're crazy like a shit house rat sometimes

741
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:29,100
I love your show yeah yeah yeah that's all right but you know at least we all respect our each

742
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:36,700
others craziness um so I did want to mention that congressman Ron Paul has now actually

743
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:41,180
shifted a little bit he initially said well he came out with a four point plan and a lot of this

744
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:45,580
has to do with the money system and the federal reserve and we've talked about this before and that's

745
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:51,900
when he was on stage um and he didn't have all for them but the idea was he was endorsing a chuck

746
01:16:51,900 --> 01:17:03,180
Baldwin bob bar uh Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader and now he has a blog post about that which

747
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:07,740
you can read a link in the show notes a daily source code dot com and he's come out and he said

748
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:11,340
you know what I'm changing that I'm revising it I want to come out and I'm gonna support

749
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:21,740
Chuck Baldwin who is the nominee for the Constitution party and um now I I pretty much would

750
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:27,420
almost hands down say if uh Dr. Ron Paul endorses anyone I'm all for it so

751
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:33,980
tentatively I'm gonna say I'm gonna endorse him I you know I hate his website this outdated shit on

752
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:39,740
there last post is you know like end of September that's no good so there's the movement clearly

753
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:45,580
is not there I've seen the guy speak he's a little dry you know need some sprucing up but he

754
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:50,780
does have the right message as far as I can tell I'm gonna dive into and see what uh what is it

755
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:57,420
Baldwin08 dot com you just uh check the website for a second oh it's so bad Baldwin castle it's

756
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:06,060
Baldwin08 dot com uh the accuracy that uh he's got the message but here we go the last uh the last

757
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:12,060
article at the top featured articles September 26 that's no good that's just no good you can't

758
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:20,300
run a campaign like that this is gonna be some some action some posting so uh anyway maybe

759
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:28,700
maybe in 2012 so definitely uh check that out in the show notes all right so finally I just want to say

760
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:37,500
amongst all of this and the most of our brothers and sisters in these United States are either a

761
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:45,980
fuel that they are a red state person a blue state person a McCain an Obama a Republican a Democrat

762
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:51,500
and I'm feeling I'm not feeling the love I'm in fact I'm feeling quite the opposite I'm feeling uh

763
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:57,660
and I'm hearing hatred actual hatred and you know those people are stupid and these people are

764
01:18:57,660 --> 01:19:03,340
stupid and they're dumb you don't know what you're talking about and more of the same and uh oh

765
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:12,620
now I you know what the reason why we're angry at each other is because the differences are so small

766
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:18,220
the new look at the how the votes always come down these guys are saying the same thing they work

767
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:24,060
for the same people they're work for Wall Street they bailed Wall Street out Wales Wall Street

768
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:28,620
continued some of that money's going right back to them Wall Street continues to finance them

769
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:34,620
and regardless of which one takes over the presidency they will be run by the same people that are

770
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:41,260
orchestrating this one banking system this one world government injecting our children with crap

771
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:48,300
letting not only toxins flow into a financial system but literally flow into the shit that we

772
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:57,260
grow our food in this is why we're so angry but don't take it out on that shit don't take it out

773
01:19:57,260 --> 01:20:02,940
on us on on each other that's what we have to stop that's what we have to watch out for if we do that

774
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:08,380
we are truly doomed don't take it out on each other that's what they want

775
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:42,140
we want you on the other top of rackers on top of rackers

776
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:50,540
or you still don't take it out or you still don't take it out or you still don't take it out

777
01:20:50,540 --> 01:21:05,100
or you still don't take it out or you still don't take it out or you still don't take it out

778
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:23,020
see the blue rooms and it's run through our lion and the horn or the horn and it jumps on them

779
01:21:53,500 --> 01:22:06,300
I feel this morning this morning there are one just two you are right

780
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:31,900
I don't want you on the other top rackers on top of rackers on top of rackers on the other top rackers

781
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:39,580
the horn and it's you mean what you said oh you still good

782
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:56,580
It's all they want. They want to spice it in fight.

783
01:22:56,580 --> 01:23:07,380
Got to love us. I'm Bob Marley. I'm a waitress. Top rank and winding up Daddy's

784
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:14,580
source code episode seven nine or seven. All right, it's a, oh man, okay. That was a rather long

785
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:20,380
show. It's past midnight, so I'm going to wrap this up. And probably for our Friday, I'm still

786
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:27,380
going to be here in San Francisco. And well, keep the source code drop going. It's just

787
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:32,700
such a valuable resource. It truly is, I now check it several times a day. There's so much,

788
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:38,700
even when it's stuff comes in for the second time. It's okay. I love this system. Hey,

789
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:46,420
you guys at drop.au, you rock. We still got freedom. The walls are closing in, but I want

790
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:50,740
you to really take advantage of what you've got and do something with it. Remember the

791
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:55,580
call to actions we have for this episode. Call and tell us what you're really doing about

792
01:23:55,580 --> 01:24:00,340
it. Instead of just agreeing, I like with the, look at the candy man said there. And no matter

793
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:06,940
what you do, live your life with passion. Another fine, medial presentation. Stick it

794
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:07,940
in your ear.
