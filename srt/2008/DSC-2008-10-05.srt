1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
And now it's time for a long-distance dedication.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,360
Todd from Jersey writes, dear Casey, back in the 80s my friend Yann and I used to have

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,160
the greatest times.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,040
We would run wild on Fridays, getting all food barred and watching MTV's Headbangers

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,320
Ball with Adam Curry.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,280
Yann would create great games around the names of tunes, and I would try to introduce him

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,160
to the latest bands.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,360
It was truly a unique and special time.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,080
Then Yann returned to the Netherlands.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,960
We tried to keep in touch, but nothing was like those Fubar Fridays.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,080
Casey, could you play Adam Curry's Daily Source Code 796 for Yann?

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,040
The Fubar Friday edition.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,880
I know he is out there somewhere remembering those Fridays too, and the DSC 796 will

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,760
really make his day.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,040
Honestly, Todd, well Todd, he is your long-distance dedication.

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:49,880
You need to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to be gay.

17
00:01:49,880 --> 00:02:19,880
You need to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it

18
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:49,880
run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run and if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run and if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to create it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, if you want to make it run, music, you

19
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,880
Oh, let it set you on the road

20
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,880
You can buy another

21
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:26,880
Oh, let it set you on the road

22
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,880
Oh, let it set you on the road

23
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,880
Oh, let it set you on the road

24
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,880
You can now

25
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,880
You can now

26
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,880
You've got a sound, you're willing to hear

27
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
But you live in all the different

28
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,880
You get it, you fall in the wind

29
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,880
You get it, baby, you get it

30
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Oh, let it set you on the road

31
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,880
Oh, let it set you on the road

32
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,880
That's right

33
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,880
A big wild street shuffle we all witnessed it

34
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
This past week

35
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,880
In the United States of America

36
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,880
Hey everybody, you're doing a steady source code

37
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Episode number seven, nine or six coming to you from the Curry condo

38
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,880
It's, um, well, it's Friday somewhere

39
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
It's Sunday, elsewhere

40
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,880
It's Saturday night here

41
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,880
It's currently nine, 20

42
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Probably the past four or five hours

43
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,880
I've been just scouring through the archives

44
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,880
I'm feeling a bit bit melancholy

45
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,880
On the other hand, uh, reasonably chilled out

46
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
And, uh, and relaxed

47
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,880
But I just didn't want to get into an entire, you know, long-winded show

48
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,880
About how messed up everything is

49
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,880
Make no mistake, my friends

50
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,880
It is not a Wall Street crisis, it is a global banking crisis

51
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,880
And I say specifically banking because it's their system

52
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
And we're just attached to that system

53
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,880
And, uh, it's come crashing down

54
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,880
And there are many, many ways you could learn about this system

55
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
Uh, if you've been listening to this program

56
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,880
You've probably already learned quite quite a lot

57
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,880
Uh, if not, there's a significant information out there on the internet

58
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,880
I'm going to touch on a lot of different things

59
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
Uh, in the show

60
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,880
Which I think is kind of a show you might want to consider

61
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Um, playing on the speakers at home

62
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,880
Uh, preferably, uh, you know, just, I mean, a Sunday afternoon

63
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,880
I think would probably be perfect

64
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,880
And really, if you're 30

65
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
Hmm, I'd have to say 35 years or older

66
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
You're going to enjoy this show

67
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Uh, because I spent four or five hours pulling together

68
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,880
I must have, I don't know, 20 songs

69
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Something like that

70
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
And they're all relevant, all relevant to my mood

71
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,880
I relevant to what's going on in the world

72
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,880
And we'll probably speak louder than any words

73
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,880
That, uh, that I could, uh, could come up with

74
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,880
Now, just, briefly on this bailout bill

75
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,880
Um, this is a bill about power

76
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,880
And it went from three pages to 106 pages

77
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,880
To 451 pages in the time of what, what was it?

78
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Not even two weeks?

79
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,880
No, no, not even one, not even one full week

80
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,880
And it was, uh, past, under extreme pressure

81
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Um, I believe even, uh, threatening pressure

82
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Uh, going on inside, uh, the House of Representatives

83
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Um, probably the Senate as well

84
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,880
And this is really a bill that is good for the bankers

85
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
They are bailing themselves out

86
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Before everything comes crashing down

87
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,880
Um, the, what they're doing is they're creating, uh,

88
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,880
Inflation which could lead to hyperinflation

89
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Which means prices go up way way up

90
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,880
And you buy less for your money

91
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,880
And, uh, I mean, there's all kinds of things that could happen

92
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,880
And, uh, one just interesting thing

93
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,880
You know, I'm pretty much, um, uh, pretty much

94
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,880
Reliant upon ATM machines while I'm here

95
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,880
Um, ones that are in the neighborhood

96
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
None of them have cash, it's Saturday

97
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
None of them have any cash at the moment

98
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,880
And in fact, one of them was giving, we weird transaction errors

99
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,880
Not got to walk like four blocks to get some cash

100
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,880
And I'm hoping it's not related

101
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,880
But anything could happen at this point

102
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,880
It's a very, very connected world

103
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Just as the physical world is connected

104
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,880
The world of finance connects to everything

105
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,880
And the bankers got themselves out

106
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,880
And it was, you know, with the knowledge that I have

107
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,880
Which is not that hard to gain

108
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,880
Understanding how the, how the, how the, fractional, uh, lending, fractional banking works

109
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,880
And I'm going to give you some pointers by the way

110
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,880
We can learn about this over the weekend

111
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,880
It's not hard at all

112
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,880
And, you know, I'm just, uh, I'm just a kid

113
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,880
From America

114
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,880
You know, hey, Europeans, we're all the stupid people live

115
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
Yeah, I want an M

116
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,880
And I could figure it out

117
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,880
It's really not that hard

118
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,880
And when you, and when you understand what's going on

119
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,880
You're watching C-SPAN, a lot of C-SPAN actually, boys, that fantastic

120
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,880
Uh, um, watching Pelosi holding the bill out in front of, uh,

121
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Reporters in a nice little blue box

122
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Before she sent it off to Bush

123
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,880
We had, uh, Bush and Paulson, the secretary of the treasury standing on the

124
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
Capital steps

125
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,880
Looking like two thugs, smug little thugs

126
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Ha ha, we did it

127
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,880
And of course, we couldn't even communicate with our representatives

128
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,880
Because they, uh, for all intents and purposes just took down the website that

129
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,880
To enable you to email your, uh, your congressman or congresswoman

130
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,880
Uh, uh, because there was too much, uh, use of the website

131
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
Yeah, I wonder why

132
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,880
Let's see what else has happened with your money, AIG

133
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
Which, uh, we already own 80% of

134
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,880
Used another 61 billion dollars in federal reserve loans

135
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,880
Links in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

136
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Uh, the, uh, the entire bailout, now I just haven't had the energy to go through all the pages

137
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
I know what's in there, I know what they're doing

138
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,880
Um, they're going to be paying back foreign banks, foreign investors

139
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
It's all in the bill

140
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Um,

141
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,880
There's, uh, there's all kinds of weird stuff in there

142
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,880
Hidden taxes, tax relief

143
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,880
But, uh, a carbon tax provision

144
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Um, and of course, you know, in order to spend

145
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,880
$700 billion of our money

146
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,880
They had to add it over another 100 billion

147
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Almost at the 150 billion of bullshit stuff

148
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,880
There'd no normally never would have passed

149
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
The people just pile an arm

150
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,880
They weren't, they weren't talking about the actual bill

151
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,880
No, they weren't talking about getting their shit in there

152
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,880
I mean, even if even if all the chalk hides all together

153
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,880
Said, hey, let's go and spend 150 billion

154
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,880
Dollars, we would probably have a hard time coming up with a way to spend it

155
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
In a month, let alone a couple days

156
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Amazing how quickly they could write all that, huh?

157
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
All those pages

158
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,880
You don't think any of that was pre-written to you

159
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,880
Or is it really possible to get hundreds of lawyers together

160
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,880
One moment and within days, right, hundreds of pages of legislation

161
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
I guess so

162
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
I guess so

163
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Ralph Nader, who I will talk to

164
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
I will talk about later

165
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Gave a species

166
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
I'm actually, I'm turning on to Ralph Nader

167
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,880
There's a couple of independence that I want to mention later on today

168
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,880
But before I get to Ralph Nader, let me play something for these frequency eos

169
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,880
These guys who basically cause the problem

170
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,880
By creating debt upon debt upon debt upon debt

171
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
And splitting up risk

172
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Stupidly

173
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
Because I found this on the pod tape music network

174
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,880
I thought you'd get a kick out of it

175
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,880
Literally a shit kicker out of it

176
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
Hey, you bastard CEOs

177
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Keto Peters has a song for you

178
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
I must see a CEO

179
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Ralph Nader, who I will talk about

180
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
The show

181
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,880
I'll be king till the numbers fall

182
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
A little dip goodbye

183
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,880
That's all

184
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,880
I must see a CEO

185
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,880
But trickle feeds them down below

186
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
We ring every nook and vain

187
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,880
Oh my dead before the rain

188
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Oh we shot the dirt well by doing glue

189
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
I think it's no last too long

190
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,880
In my neighborhood

191
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,880
I'm a CEO

192
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,880
I must see a CEO

193
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Ralph Nader, who I will talk about

194
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
I'm a CEO

195
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
But I'm so proud I scaled a link

196
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Virtues mostly fall the way

197
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
I must see a CEO

198
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Where did all our futures go

199
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
Looks like I look straight ahead

200
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Got to be the eighth turns ring

201
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,880
I wish I could turn well by doing glue

202
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,880
It saves no last too long

203
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,880
In my neighborhood

204
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
I must see a CEO

205
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,880
But trickle feeds them down below

206
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
I've heard too much doomsday stick

207
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,880
I don't questions make me sick

208
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,880
I know I'm doing well by doing glue

209
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,880
Down there's no last law

210
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,880
In my neighborhood

211
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
They took our money

212
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
And more importantly

213
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,880
They took the power into their own hands

214
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Finally they have all the pieces that they want

215
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
Keyto Peters from the pod save music network

216
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
And CEO

217
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Before I get to Ralph Nader

218
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
I want to play a little bit from Dr. Ron Paul

219
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
Congressman who of course voted against this bill

220
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,880
Along with 170 other true patriots

221
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
who see that this is absolutely wrong

222
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,880
Make sure that you know if you're

223
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,880
Not just your congressmen or congresswoman

224
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
But if your senator approved this bill

225
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
And I would like to remind everyone

226
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Immediately that both Barack Obama and John McCain

227
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,880
voted for this bailout bill

228
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Barack Obama according to the record has about

229
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
20 has received about 25 million

230
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Dollars and donations from Wall Street firms

231
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Including a half million donation from Goldman Sachs

232
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
These are all names you should recognize by now

233
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,880
These aren't these are the top of the news

234
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
John McCain I think only $3 million less

235
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,880
$22 million from Wall Street firms

236
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,880
So don't you think that these guys should give that

237
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
Give that money back

238
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,880
Well Ralph Nader has a pretty good rap on that

239
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
The first here's Congressman Paul

240
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,880
who his immediate response right after the bill

241
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,880
And he just he it rolls off his tongue so quickly

242
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
He just slams it right out

243
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,880
And immediately you understand what's going

244
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Ron Paul joining us now to let us know what he thinks of this

245
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
Bill as we look at it

246
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,880
That is just from the CNN actually

247
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
Is a heck of a lot of pork isn't it

248
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Sure is it's pretty amazing you take a bad bill

249
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,880
And make it a lot worse and you get 57 members of the Congress switching from

250
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,880
No to yeah so that's actually something about Washington

251
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,880
There's really not hope much hope for us here in DC to solve the problems

252
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Because it's just more the same more the spending

253
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
You know they're dealing with this

254
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,880
There is a financial crisis and a credit crunch

255
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,880
But they're not dealing with the fact that this country is bankrupt

256
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,880
And and and we're on the verge of some really major events

257
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
But we're adding far to the fuel there

258
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,880
We're just dumping carocene on it and making this problem that much worse

259
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,880
If death is a problem just think of what we've just done today

260
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,880
We have ballooned a debt like never before

261
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,880
Putting more pressure on the Federal Reserve to monetize this debt

262
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,880
And print more money so expect a lot more inflation inflation in the future

263
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Do you think there was a reasonable alternative for this?

264
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,880
Oh absolutely do nothing would have been a reasonable alternative

265
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,880
But a reasonable alternative would have been to give some tax breaks

266
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,880
And also regulate the Federal Reserve

267
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
The exchange stabilization front

268
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,880
The President's working group on financial markets

269
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,880
They need regulate because they're working behind the scenes all the time

270
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,880
To satisfy and take care of their friends and buddies

271
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,880
So those are the kind of regulations we do need

272
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,880
But we should be enforcing contracts not canceling

273
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Contracts like they are doing you know in the mortgage market

274
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,880
But the most important thing that we should not be doing

275
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,880
And that is to prop up bad death and malinvestment

276
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,880
Because that only prolongs the agony and makes our problems that much worse

277
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Do you think that a lot of the politicians and I hate to use that word

278
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,880
But it's one of many of the markets where I look at you guys there and Washington

279
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,880
Really got this thing really understood it because I got to tell you

280
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,880
This is a really complicated deal perhaps as complicated as anything

281
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
It's ever been passed right?

282
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,880
I don't think I think it's the idea what's in the bill and what it does

283
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
And the unintended consequences

284
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,880
But you know Warren Buffett said he had no really good understanding of the derivatives market

285
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,880
That's why he stayed away from it

286
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
So he has trouble understanding them

287
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Can you imagine the average member of Congress

288
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Understanding the correction of the problems that have developed

289
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,880
Because the derivatives market is becoming unravel

290
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,880
So now there's very little understanding of the nature

291
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Because they're limiting their thoughts to a credit crunch

292
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Which means some people have lost their credit rating

293
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,880
And that's good because why keep learning the people that don't have a good credit rating

294
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,880
People who have good ratings can still borrow money and buy a car

295
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,880
People who have overspent and overbarred like the US government

296
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
They're going to have trouble and we are having trouble

297
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,880
But we have to deal with the nature of government and why we spend so much money

298
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Run pull

299
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Oh man

300
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
Oh man

301
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,880
He comes out of him so easily doesn't it?

302
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
He just says it like it is

303
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,880
You know the Ralph Nader thing I would like to play it for you

304
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,880
But I'm worried that the sound is kind of shitty because it's indirect

305
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,880
So I'm not going to play that but you have to watch it because

306
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Well this is really the problem with Ralph Nader

307
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,880
He was running for president by the way

308
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
And you can vote on him there are a couple other independence

309
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,880
And yes, thank you for all the notes

310
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Bob bar

311
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Not Ron bar

312
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Bob bar

313
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
Chuck Baldwin, Cynthia McKinney

314
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,880
These are the main independence that I'm aware of at least

315
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,880
And even if you know the Cynthia McKinney is quite interesting to me as well

316
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,880
I think what's her website?

317
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
It's like vote o8.com

318
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
I'll get to her later

319
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
But the Ralph Nader thing

320
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
You got to listen to it

321
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,880
The whole problem with Ralph Nader is he has absolutely zero like fire

322
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,880
And enthusiasm he talks you know just like it almost like he's dead

323
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,880
And people just tune out within seconds I'm sure

324
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,880
But you put all of this together man

325
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Yeah, man

326
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,880
I knew we were heading for something bad

327
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,880
But now with this bill passed and all the crap that's in it

328
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,880
And look at how happy these cock suckers look

329
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Ah

330
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,880
They know they've got us by the balls now

331
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,880
So when we start hurting that's what we're going to take action

332
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
I'm sure

333
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
Adam

334
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,880
Yeah

335
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
We're in Portland

336
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
Every morning

337
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
I wake up I have a coffee

338
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,880
I walked across my backyard

339
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,880
And I go to my office

340
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,880
And I don't plot the drugs report

341
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
I don't pull up puffin' post

342
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
And I don't pull up the BBC

343
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,400
I pull up the drop dot IO

344
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,880
Yes

345
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Daily source code

346
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,880
It is the best place for news

347
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
because I'm a contributor

348
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
I am Ed dashboard

349
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,880
Really egg

350
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
And

351
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
Other people are contributing

352
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,160
contributing also, we are outside of the mainstream, we're pulling it together under our own

353
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:54,320
perspective. We are an aggregator, the alligator of truth. I am wide awake. I have taken the

354
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:03,440
red pill and I've pulled because that's crunches stuff is nasty. Right, oh, man. You know, I do the

355
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,680
same thing when I wake up in the morning. It's drop.au slash daily source code because that's where

356
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,960
the true news is coming through and it's outrageous, some of the stuff that is an disappearing

357
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,360
in mainstream publications and we're just aggregating it, make sure you check that regularly

358
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:24,320
drop.au slash daily source code. This is also why I found out that the follow-up to the most

359
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,880
excellent movie zeitgeist is now out and available, link in the show notes of daily source

360
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:37,280
code.com. It's called zeitgeist Adendum and it completely explains how the money system works

361
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,320
where there's always a man out. It's like musical chairs because there's not enough money

362
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:49,200
in circulation for all the loans plus interest to be paid back. That's the long in the short of it.

363
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,280
And then it, you know, it kind of takes you through what can happen, what what we could do,

364
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,680
where we could take it. And actually there's a call to action, which I like about this.

365
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,760
About two hours long, well worth the watch. A lot of it, you'll probably already know or understand,

366
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,880
but that means you're learning. We're learning. That's good. The call to action at the end is

367
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:18,880
is pretty simple. Expose the banking fraud by, uh, well, exposing it first and foremost, but then

368
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,200
also, um, boycotting the banks and they talk about, uh, bank of America, city banks specifically,

369
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:33,200
uh, boycott the military, meaning no longer let your children, your friends, your co-workers,

370
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,640
join it because they're not fighting for your freedom, they're not fighting for your country. They don't

371
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:45,360
know it. Unfortunately, they don't know. They're fighting for corporations. There's a call to reject

372
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:54,480
the political system. Um, a lot to say about that, particularly now that I've learned that,

373
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,320
well, this is just one of those funny things. And it's something that I, I'm really

374
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,320
saddened and pick up on, uh, on earlier, but, uh, you know, there's a reason why only the Republican

375
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,520
and Democratic candidates get to debate on television. That's because there's some bogus-fucking

376
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,120
organization that, uh, that is the, uh, the representative or the organization that determines who

377
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,800
can be on the debates. And they, of course, uh, are founded by a Republican and a Democrat,

378
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:28,160
and they're run by these two parties. So there's no way an independent can even get into the debate.

379
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,880
And so there's not like law or anything that says they can't, it's just, you know, mainstream media,

380
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,920
regulating what we can see, determining the war you could call it censoring.

381
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,760
And of course, there's a call to join the movement. And as, and I was going through this, and I'm

382
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,360
prepping the show and I've been prepping the show kind of since Friday. You know, we did, um,

383
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,320
I was really busy, but also John and I did, uh, did a Thursday night, no agenda. So I, I,

384
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,880
just didn't have the band with the creator of Friday show. As I'm going through this, I'm like,

385
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,320
you know, we used to have all these cool fucking songs that would talk about the world around us and,

386
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,120
and what we felt. And, you know, and I'm talking like not even that long ago, you know, in the

387
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,520
80s and the 70s and there were shit out there. And when we were angry, you could really hear it. And I'm

388
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:20,320
really not hear it. And this, in this corporate bubblegum pop crap that passes from music these days.

389
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:41,600
Even these guys used to be cool. Remember this. I'm getting goosebumps just listening to that

390
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,000
intro. You too, on the Charlie.

391
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:27,280
Oh

392
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:57,280
I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I

393
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:27,280
I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not a human, I'm not an human, I'm not an human, I'm not a human, I'm not an human, I'm just an ordinary, I'm not a human, I'm just an ordinary, I'm just a human, I'm not a human, I'm just an ordinary, I'm just an ordinary

394
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,280
You're the sister's daughter-in-law

395
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Somebody, but it's not me

396
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Somebody, but it's not me

397
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,280
How long have you seen this song?

398
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:49,280

00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:56,280

00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:07,280
Somebody, but it's not me

402
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:27,280
Somebody, but it's not me

403
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,280
You're the sister's daughter-in-law

404
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Somebody, but it's not me

405
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,280
Somebody, but it's not me

406
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Somebody, but it's not me

407
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,280
Oh, there's tears away

408
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Oh, there's tears away

409
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Oh, there's tears away

410
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Oh, there's tears away

411
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:10,280
Oh, there's tears away

412
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,280
Oh, there's tears

413
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,280
Oh, there's tears away

414
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Oh, there's tears away

415
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,280
And it's true we are you

416
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:30,280
We're like the picture to feel the tears

417
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,280
And today the million is quiet

418
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,280
We need a great one tomorrow night

419
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,280
Oh, there's tears away

420
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,280
Oh, there's tears away

421
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:52,280
Oh, there's tears away

422
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,280
Oh, there's tears away

423
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Where's that bottle, huh? Bring him back

424
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
Oh, there's tears

425
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,280
That's corporate shadow

426
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Although I think honestly he really believed that he could change the world with corporate money

427
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,280
No way, man

428
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,280
We got to take the money out of the equation

429
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,280
It truly is the root of all evil

430
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,280
As constructed

431
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:30,280
By the true owners of the earth

432
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,280
You too, Sunday, funny Sunday

433
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,280
On Daddy's source code 79 or six

434
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,280
There was so much inspiration, so many cool things

435
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,280
That happened over the past like 36 hours

436
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,280
That I was watching or thinking about

437
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
So that's where I got all the inspiration from

438
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,280
For all the songs that I'm gonna play for you

439
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Last night actually

440
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
Well, there's no today shows

441
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
So I wanted to get

442
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Some current feedback from the mainstream

443
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
On the debate

444
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:10,000
And so Letterman, of course, is always a good choice and he's done exactly what I expected him to do as he's laying really hard into Sarah Pailin

445
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:18,200
Of course for those of you who don't know and if you haven't please listen to Noah Jenda Noah jended up

446
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,160
Meavio.com

447
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,960
Because you know this whole thing is it's just a show

448
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,200
It's just one big television show and these two parties

449
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,640
They pretty much agree on all the same things as no real difference

450
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,400
Both McCain and Obama voted to to pass this bill to help their buddies on on Wall Street

451
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,960
They're contributors millions of dollars

452
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,160
Go to the show notes and check out the video of Ralph Nader he'll he'll tell you more about it

453
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
DailySourceco.com

454
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,200
But anyway, so Craig Ferguson comes on

455
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,560
at what is that like 1235 and for the the whole opening the first

456
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
Oh, I should preface this by saying that

457
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
After 10 days here

458
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,120
I have connected with with one of the organic farmers

459
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,560
Who grow some of the most awesome is only herb in in this part of the country and they do it with love

460
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:20,960
I mean this this is a no, it'll make a lot, but it's a it's a real agricultural operation not not a money making scheme

461
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,600
And well some money. I'm sure but there you go

462
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,880
So I'm it's Friday night right so I'm it had a long week

463
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,560
I'm chill and I'm watching Craig Ferguson and

464
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
Kind of baked so

465
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:44,000
And he has this like sock puppet like muppet doing the whole opening and it's like all about this research they've been doing

466
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,680
And you know, so it's a whole long lineup is a fantastic joke

467
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,880
That they've they've researched and found out that a lot of people who watch

468
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,240
Late night was it to the late show or yeah, I think it's a late show

469
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,760
That they that they smoke herbal cigarettes and so of course I'm like

470
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:10,720
Laughing because they were right and then one of his first viewer males is is about some get from some guy who's name is Adam

471
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
And he's like oh man play that

472
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,720
Play that viewer male jingle because if you played while I'm baked it would like totally trip me out

473
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,440
And so you know here's Craig Ferguson, you know

474
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:27,600
Using my name talking about a situation and then it got me thinking

475
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,400
Hello, anybody there man

476
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,440
Yeah, like a make really happy you man

477
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
I sure also

478
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,280
Face okay, if I fool around of him it do beware room

479
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,480
All right

480
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Yeah

481
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,640
Two eight out on order a hash brownies man

Oh, man, you always get it you wait this place, man. Yeah, hey, they guys

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,240

Oh, wow

485
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Just once I bring the cops

486
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,960
All right, there's those steps in the seeds

487
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,440
Never run if you be and you guys make a bacon double wide burger

488
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,080
These are my splits two days

All right, so here's a these are feedback that comes from

494
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,080
One of our chuckle heads who calls them very often. I always appreciate is appreciate his feedback

495
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,440
If you want to leave a voice male you can do that you can just drop an MP3 into the source code drop

496
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,200
Or that you can actually go to drop.au slash daily source code on the right hand side

497
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,760
You'll tell you how you can call in using phone number and a pin code and it'll show up as a as a voice male

498
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,800
In the drop, which is where I get you know everything is basically source now

499
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,240
From there for this show and and there's also a record over it. You know, so if I don't use it then

500
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,600
It still gets out to the community for those who are interested in listening to a lot of voice male

501
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
So Ross from Washington

502
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,560
Send it in the following which I'm very happy he did

503
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,320
Hey, Curry

504
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,320
Trust in Washington

505
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,520
Down here South of Seattle next to see that care port. Oh, yo, and all right bus

506
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,680
Uh, I want to use some bad references here, but

507
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,760
Got the five tell you what's on my mind. I keep here. What you're saying about this whole

508
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:58,800
The world basically the world's constructed around us there's a great awakening and

509
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,240
All this stuff and you know, I know that could think of it. He's like a cross between the expiles

510
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,360
And the matrix yeah good apologies speak of this

511
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,880
Mobile conspiracy that seems to be so vast

512
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,400
You know what and I've said this many times before

513
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:26,160
But it's often the biggest mountain that you don't see in front of you when you're looking for little trees. This is this way you learn as a pilot

514
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,640
When you start out you're instructor will lay down a map in front of you and say you're going from here and you're to there

515
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,440
Now find all the obstructions you have to look at look out for and so you're going to be looking for trees and towers and

516
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,400
Telephone poles and all kinds of stuff and you'll be pointing them out on the map and he'll say

517
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,160
Dude, how about that freaking mountain right in the path

518
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,440
How come you're not going to look to avoid that

519
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,520
So it's not like a conspiracy

520
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,840
This has been going on for a long long time and history is a lot longer than

521
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,240
The history channel can show you

522
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,360
This has been going on for

523
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,600
centuries

524
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,120
millennia

525
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,400
Okay

526
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,000
People's suppressing people and it all revolves around pretty much around money and a lot of

527
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,040
Ancillary crap that pops up to make it tougher like religion

528
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,920
So it's not a global you know conspiracy it's how the world works

529
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,400
But not how the world necessarily has to be

530
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,520
That no one's can in theory do anything about it at every time something happens. There's always a contingency plan for it

531
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,080
And yes, there's this awakening you know like this right neocard is going to come up

532
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,160
And the human population is going to rise up against the autonomous now unfortunately Russ

533
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,360
I don't believe that's going to happen the only way you know this great awakening is as you put it

534
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:59,760
Is truly an awakening people are now you know seeing things and it's because we can now communicate amongst ourselves

535
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,080
All please like we have to protect the internet

536
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,360
That's why we're waking up our our consciousness and this has been predicted actually in religion

537
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:16,240
You know our consciousness is now melding together through Google and Facebook and my space and and web logs and and podcasts and

538
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,880
whatever else

539
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,880
An instant messages and chat and

540
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,760
On and on and on you know flicker

541
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Exchanging images

542
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,240
Seeing the world I mean we don't think twice, but but it you know

543
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,240
I communicate with people from Iran how come my government wants to kill them

544
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,520
And how come we think that they want to kill us they don't their government maybe and it makes no sense

545
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,840
So that isn't awakening and we can't be fooled anymore

546
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,360
Unless of course we're still stuck to the television and and sucked in and

547
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,560
And hypnotized which is what that box is all about so yeah of course

548
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,680
There's an awakening, but no no quick fix is taking a long time to get us to where we are

549
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:10,800
To get us to be in complete submission and enslaved because you know we have to the way the system works

550
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:17,600
So yeah, it's that doesn't mean like oh, oh now we have to you know run around and save the world

551
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,800
Well, you can't we can't do that overnight, but

552
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,680
Part of solving the problem is

553
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,320
Waking up to the problem and talking about it amongst ourselves. So you know

554
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,720
That's just a starting point Russ

555
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,440
The great conspiracy just like in the expile series and move

556
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,040
Always be one five 20 steps ahead and

557
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,080
People like you just gonna be a brief value. You know just like

558
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,840
Meal was just like or fierce was that you're gonna

559
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,480
Disoppose it. I'm not saying that you will but you know you are this embodiment of this great awakening

560
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,600
Then you guys want to try something or

561
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,240
Once you do get to a certain level the

562
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,520
Powers that be you're gonna come to you all

563
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,920
For a few add in these

564
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,280
Circular cyclical cycle will begin again

565
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,840
ah

566
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
I don't think I'm that important

567
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,840
uh

568
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,960
No, we're not gonna go do anything and

569
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,880
This is about an awakening of consciousness and it'll all happen automatically if enough

570
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,440
You know, one not if but one enough people have figured it out

571
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,040
Then there'll be no stopping us. I mean that's that's just the bottom line

572
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,200
It's not gonna be a handful of people. I it's not gonna be like a Gideon's army

573
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,440
We have uh, you know, 300 of 10,000 go and and topple the powers now

574
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,080
That's not gonna be like that. It's gonna be massive and

575
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,640
It's you know there will be there will just be no and doesn't you have to be violence? There will be no stopping it

576
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,240
Once we figure out how to vote and how we you know reject

577
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,040
Rigged voting machines and and lack of choice

578
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,160
Really, you know, we have no choice well of course we do

579
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,960
But the percentage of people who can actually name three other independent candidates running for president

580
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,440
Identified would wager is fairly low

581
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,080
Because they're excluded from the mainstream, you know that so that's that's the game right there

582
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,080
We got to start changing that game first

583
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
And that could take another 20 years

584
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,080
But yeah, I feel it is my responsibility to

585
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:43,040
the past this information on and and to help people get there and so when else is gonna have to pick it up eventually

586
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,560
And I'm not the only one man. This is all over the place

587
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:53,680
So there must be millions of people who who who are switched on to this and who are communicating it and are in their own way

588
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,920
Re routing and broadcasting the information

589
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,840
That's step one. That's what we're all doing here

590
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,120
You know, so unfortunately unlike the rest of you'd like your life to be

591
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,440
There's you know, we don't solve it in 22 minutes plus eight minutes of commercials like they do on TV

592
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,880
You know, it's not gonna be a sitcom that winds up and

593
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
All happily ever after

594
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You know, we've actually got to do some work

595
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,480
Not doesn't mean you have to go out and start you know yelling and screaming and beating up and

596
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,040
Politicians no no no

597
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,720
We've first got to get every we first got to get scale

598
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,880
Actual scale

599
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,360
I've seen all these small you know small groups doesn't work

600
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,680
So that's just and that's just information of the of the mind you know passing that information on and it's clear

601
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,320
Rust you know what's going on you you're awake for sure

602
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
Again, you know, yeah, sounds like I really fed

603
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,080
You know analysis that really seems to be what you keep presenting to me and

604
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,960
You know you you say that we the people to make it's different and you

605
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,040
You present this huge

606
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:07,440
Unscalable and feasible force that we have to overcome and you're right is probably have true

607
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:14,320
Not as big as we view it to be but really what where are you going with all this?

608
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,760
So that's a simple for a second you are right

609
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,000
So what points are you right? I it really seems like a hopeless endeavor

610
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,800
Because really when it comes down to us you're to get the people it you don't need

611
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,640
To program the human species you don't need to put

612
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,640
For oxide or fluoride into their water. You don't need to

613
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:42,240
Fatter on with advertisements it's a libinal messaging to tell of you know that the human race as a whole are dumb scared

614
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,240
Violence to begin the visuals

615
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,960
No, that's the system has made us that way

616
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,120
That's why

617
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:55,120
This whole system of really the system of debt has has that's what there are different ways

618
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,760
There are different ways to construct our society. You know that would be a real long-term goal

619
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:08,240
But we're now we're in in fact quite the opposite we're all really intelligent beings who if fed love and light

620
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,240
Conflorish but without that now. I mean with the then you just get nothing you get robots

621
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,400
enslaved robots. That's what you're seeing add to that

622
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
whole host of

623
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,640
toxins that we're putting into our bodies

624
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,280
Whether it's constructed and but by design or not

625
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,320
We're you know we're limiting our our capacity our life capacity our consciousness capacity

626
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,720
So it's I think it kind of starts there honestly

627
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,720
That generally you have to be controlled to some way safer form because they're too

628
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,840
In confident to really run themselves so when you have that type of overwhelming power

629
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,320
You're just going to have this

630
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:58,720
cyclical cycle so yeah, Russ if you really believe that if you really believe human beings basically are just trash

631
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,640
Then you know to kill yourself. I mean that's crazy

632
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,960
I that it doesn't sit right with me now

633
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,960
It's you know maybe 10 years ago. I wasn't thinking about this stuff and I

634
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,040
Mind of

635
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,760
Certainly in in my lifetime said you know you gotta have all these rules because people just trash it

636
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,000
But if you get down to the fundamentals of people no, I think we're all good

637
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,520
I really do

638
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,360
And again, you know where we're we're all made up of the same material the same

639
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,560
Basic materials available in the universe

640
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,600
a lot of that being water and

641
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,480
I truly believe that the the system around us is just it makes us prone to

642
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,280
greed envy

643
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And then everything that stems from that

644
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,200
Yeah, I know I think it could be different Russ. That's really that's really where I'm coming from so even if you are right

645
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,480
And even if we can make a difference and don't want to seem like what's the point? I'm 100 years from now

646
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,480
It's not gonna matter same things. I'm gonna keep happening over and over

647
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,320
Just like it has in the past and it's like it has in the future so yeah, they're really convinced me here curry

648
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,880
What's the point? So

649
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,080
This is Russell Minum again here next to the sea tag Airport and

650
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,080
Love you man. Me and it's right here. Hope you win

651
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:31,720
Whatever having the people actually saying that. I think you brought that up. I don't think we need anyone does this sign off stuff

652
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,960
No, no, no, no, except for the obligatory they work for us

653
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,400
Yeah, right just like everything else on this planet in theory anyway

654
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,040
Practicality bullshit really is anyway curry hey

655
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,760
You got your final speed to you damn my old die for the death

656
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,360
die

657
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:54,800
I would defend your right to say it to the death no matter how much I made disagree with it

658
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,600
So amen talk to you later. Bye

659
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:03,040
So I really enjoy that comment Russ because basically what you're saying yeah, it's pretty much all true

660
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,280
But you're giving up and saying what can we do about it? You know in my lifetime

661
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,280
I felt freeer than I feel right now

662
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,640
Even though my government wherever I was

663
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,200
Was probably up to no good at that moment in time as well

664
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,200
But we do have to fight for it and

665
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:29,600
This has been going on for for so long and people have been singing about this and and again

666
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,120
That's where I got a lot of the inspiration for the songs I'm gonna play for you today and

667
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:39,600
And we just shouldn't give up we should continue to try and let's try and stop some of this insanity

668
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,800
We certainly are outnumber anyone

669
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:50,160
Which I think is a pretty pretty small group, but it's just a huge pyramid of power trips all the way down to us

670
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:58,400
And yes, I am with you and in in the same layer of the pyramid, okay, and we just can't we just can't sit down

671
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:05,440
I mean what else if if you're looking for a purpose in life at least let'd be to try and free up some shit

672
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,160
So our kids don't have to deal with all of this crap

673
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,200
I certainly feel that the previous generation has let me down so I don't want to make the same

674
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,400
Stand up

675
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,800
Stand up for your right

676
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Stand up

677
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,120
Don't give up the fight

678
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,880
Reach a man on tell him heaven is on the year

679
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,960
I know you don't know

680
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,960
What life is really worth

681
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,320
He's a poor bad means of his cool

682
00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:00,320
I'm the story and I've been told to now you see the right

683
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,520
Stand up for your right

684
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,440
Come on get up

685
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,440
Stand up

686
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,440
Stand up for your right

687
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,440
Get up

688
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,440
Stand up

689
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,680
Don't give up the fight

690
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,760
Get up

691
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,760
Stand up

692
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,760
Stand up for your right

693
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,760
Get up

694
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,760
Stand up

695
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,760
Don't give up the fight

696
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,920
Most people think

697
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,560
Great God will come from the sky

698
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,320
Take away everything and make a hit with that if you hide

699
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,160
But this and all what life is worth

700
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,360
You will look for yours on earth

701
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,360
And now you see the right

702
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,640
Just stand up for your right

703
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,000
Get up

704
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,440
Stand up

705
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,480
Stand up

706
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,480
Stand up for your right

707
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,640
Get up

708
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,360
Stand up

709
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,000
Get up

710
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,960
Stand up

711
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,800
Don't give up the fight

712
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,840
Reach a man on tell him heaven is on the year

713
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,240
I know you don't know what life is worth

714
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:10,800
You're right

715
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,600
God

716
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,480
Lord

717
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,760
Stand up

718
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,200
Keep us from the Lord

719
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,960
Don't give up the fight

720
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,240
Yeah

721
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,480
We're sick and tired of your exams

722
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,360
Kids in games

723
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,560
Dying and going to heaven

724
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,080
In the Jesus' name

725
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,720
Lord

726
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,280
We know when we understand

727
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,080
A mighty body's living man

728
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,920
You can't fool some people

729
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,280
Sometimes

730
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,560
But you can't fool all the people all the time

731
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,400
So now we see the light

732
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,800
What should we go to stand up for?

733
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,520
Right

734
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,720
Stand up

735
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,080
Stand up

736
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,760
Don't give up

737
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,440

Stand up

742
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,800
You don't give up

743
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,520
The violin

744
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,520
All right

745
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,040
We gotta united

746
00:48:59,040 --> 00:48:59,840
You stand up for your last

747
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,140
A Tears

Stand up

753
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,040
I know

754
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,080
Stand up for your right

755
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,440
Stand up for your right

756
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,480
You stand up for your right

757
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:08,800
Stand up for your right

758
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,960
Stand up for your right

759
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,840
Stand up for your right

760
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,640
Stand up for your right

761
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,040
Stand up for your right

762
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,440
Stand up for your right

763
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:20,640
over not certainly during this presidential election year and there's one

764
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:26,080
president that I just don't hear a lot of people quoting often and I ran

765
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:32,160
across as I was prep and I ran across a cool bit from Johnny Cash who

766
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:38,360
recites one of Lincoln's famous speeches the Gettysburg Address and I think

767
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:42,520
it's good to listen to that again you know and the Gettysburg Address

768
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,320
do you can you right now if you're an American can you tell me how it starts off

769
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:54,040
you should have said four score and seven years ago because that's how it starts

770
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:59,960
somehow it really it the the meaning really comes through a lot better when Johnny Cash

771
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:05,320
reads it so I'm gonna play that for you and there's a specific reason because there's

772
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:09,000
one thing that I am noticing this troubling that I've been here for moving up

773
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,920
on two weeks now and and you can hear the melancholy and I'm a little bit

774
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:19,000
homesick and I miss the girls but you know good inward journey here sitting

775
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:26,920
alone in the con now there is a division in America and is this red state

776
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:34,080
blue state thing that is starting to trouble me and the way I hear these so

777
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:41,280
cold sides talk about each other is bothersome and it used to be north and south

778
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,240
and now it's red state blue state and it pretty much seems like it's the coast

779
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,040
and then everything in the middle and I don't like it one bit and I want to remind

780
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,720
us that we've been through some of this crap before and we shouldn't go back to

781
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:01,760
those times again four score and seven years ago so begin the message of a war

782
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,000
weary president Abraham Lincoln a message written on the back of an envelope on the

783
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,520
train on the way to dedicate a battlefield where men from the north and south

784
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:23,120
had died at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania four score and seven years ago

785
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,920
our forefathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty

786
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:39,120
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal now we are engaged in a

787
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:46,960
great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated

788
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:53,440
can long endure we are met on a great battlefield of that war we have come to

789
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,960
dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here

790
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:05,440
gave their lives that that nation might live it is all together fitting and proper

791
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:13,680
that we should do this but in a larger sense we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate

792
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:20,800
we cannot allow this ground for the brave men living and dead who struggle here

793
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:29,680
have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract the world will little

794
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:35,440
notes or long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here

795
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:42,320
it is for us to living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who

796
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:49,600
fall here have thus far so nobly advanced it is rather for us to be here dedicated

797
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:56,480
to the great test remaining before us that from these on her dead we take increased devotion

798
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:03,840
to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we hear highly

799
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:14,080
resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain and that this nation under God shall have a new

800
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:25,840
birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people and for the people shall not

801
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:30,800
perish from the earth.

802
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:42,880
Lost it flat and Ben Rouge waiting for a train on us being inspected as magic

803

823
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,480
dreamt about playing records for my buddies cool songs that I like and of course not really

00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:50,160
records anymore and look at what we're doing man look at how the stuff is getting converted into

1171
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:27,780
Republican and Democratic debates that we've seen. I think we could get people to watch

1172
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:36,580
But you know, it would take a lot of resources for sure and you really need like a hot-shit producer

1173
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,580
Yeah, like one of these guys. It does the Emmys

1174
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:44,480
I know those people in show biz land in California who were switched on and listen to the daily source code

1175
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:48,660
If you have any ideas if you think we could actually drum up some people, you know, we could do it

1176
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:53,880
But I'm afraid we were really running short on time. It was less than 30 days now

1177
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:58,140
Yeah, listen that less than a month until until we until we hit the election

1178
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:03,320
So I just don't see it happening. We're probably going to have to wait another four years before we can actually do anything

1179
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:09,300
But at least now we can see and keep track of and keep score on what exactly is going to happen

1180
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,980
Whoever gets into the White House

1181
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:16,460
There's been a lot of promises made and well, you'll see all of them systematically broken as usual

1182
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:20,140
They're just actors. They're not actually running anything the agenda is set

1183
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:26,860
That's the way you have to look at it. So 20 years. No. I think we can probably in in four years

1184
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:32,260
We could get the independence in a real show business like debate and eventually in another four years

1185
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:34,740
So eight years from now we might actually have them in

1186
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:39,860
In with the big debates that that could be possible

1187
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:46,060
But and actually it might even be desirable as we probably go into a 10 year recession slash depression

1188
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:53,020
Which is just the way it goes boomer bus cycle with the system that we have and we'll have time to evaluate that system

1189
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,020
We got a lot of smart kids and school now

1190
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:59,580
You know there are other ways to run the society absolutely

1191
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,180
So by then we might we might be on the upswing

1192
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:06,060
So I'd say eight to ten years is probably realistic

1193
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:11,340
I had a parent on here. You know how we hopefully say

1194
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:16,180
They work for us well I'd be thinking about it and the reality is

1195
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:21,020
We work for them if you include all our direct and indirect taxes

1196
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:25,660
We work about six months of the year for the government six months

1197
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:31,500
Nobody escapes at every body pays sure they might work for us sometimes at all

1198
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,500
But rain or shine we pay

1199
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:41,500
It's a one-way relationship and that's the root of our problem the state uses its monopoly power on violence and money

1200
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:46,780
To impose its will so naturally since it's the most efficient way to maximize profit

1201
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:53,420
Special interest will converge to control the state and it's monopoly on violence to further its own ends

1202
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:58,300
So in a state of system it will and can only get worse

1203
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,660
So on that positive note

1204
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,660
Are live your life will pass?

1205
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,180
Okay, by the

1206
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,660
Absolutely no of course

1207
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:10,380
That's what I mean when we say when I say we're enslaved

1208
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:14,140
You know there's no reason we should have to work six months out of the year for the man

1209
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:16,140
That's horses

1210
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:20,700
And we should stand up and we should say it even if it's a child like anthem just do it

1211
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:40,700
We've got the right to do it

1212
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:43,980
There ain't no way we'll lose it

1213
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:48,380
This is our life, this is our song

1214
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:53,740
We'll fight the thousands we trust

1215
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:57,020
Don't make up, there's nothing wrong

1216
01:11:57,020 --> 01:12:00,220
You don't know what's yet out below

1217
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:02,220
Oh

1218
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:04,220
Oh

1219
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,220
Oh

Oh

01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:18,220
Oh, we are so proud to send it

1225
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:22,220
We are always never ready

1226
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:26,220
We don't want nothing for you

1227
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:28,220
Oh

1228
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:32,220
Your life is right treated

1229
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:36,220
So far we've never seen it

1230
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:38,220
And we're too fast

1231
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:40,220
And we're all done

1232
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:44,220
Oh

1233
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:48,220
Oh

1234
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,220
We'll fight

1235
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:52,220
Yeah

1236
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:54,220
There you'll see

1237
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,220
Oh

1238
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:58,220
Oh

1239
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:00,220
Oh

1240
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:02,220
Oh

1241
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:06,220
Oh

1242
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,220
Oh

1243
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:10,220
Oh

1244
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:12,220
Oh

1245
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:14,220
Oh

1246
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:16,220
Oh

1247
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:18,220
Oh

1248
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:20,220
Oh

1249
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:22,220
Oh

1250
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,220
Oh

1251
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:30,220
Oh

1252
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:34,220
Oh

01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:38,220
Oh

01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,220
Oh

1255
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:46,220
Oh

1256
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:48,220

1259
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:23,220
Oh, we're not for the safety.

1260
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:27,220
Hello, we're not taking it.

1261
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:30,220
Oh, we're not for the safety.

1262
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:33,220
Any more?

1263
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:57,500
At a Earth and Poland year, bad times, just thinking about how art reflects as a mirror to

1264
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,300
what happens in the world.

1265
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:06,060
I have so listening to no one else by Grandmaster Flash in the Furious Five, right?

1266
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:09,340
So it's like a jungle sometimes.

1267
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:14,460
It makes me wonder how I keep going under, ain't that right?

1268
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:23,820
All I have to say at this point is, don't push me, cause I'm close to the edge and I'm

1269
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:30,820
trying to end up telling you this, my head.

1270
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:31,820
It's like a jungle sometimes.

1271
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,820
It makes me wonder how I keep going under, ain't that right?

1272
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:43,820
Think I'm...

1273
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:44,820
So, proper's doing bad.

1274
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:47,820
It's gonna be my mother's TV, says she watch it too much.

1275
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:48,820
It's just not healthy.

1276
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:53,140
All my children in the big-top, Dallas and night can even see the game or the sugar

1277
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:54,140
rate fight.

1278
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:58,140
To be able to collect it, they ring my phone and scan my wife when I'm not home.

1279
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:02,140
Got a bomb education double digit and flavor can take the train to the job.

1280
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:03,140
There's a spike at the station.

1281
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:07,140
On King Kong standin' on my back, can't stop the turn around.

1282
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:12,140
But, secondly, I got a mid-range my Grandmaster remember, sometimes I think I'm going to see

1283
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,140
that swell.

1284
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,140
I might not jack a plane.

1285
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,140
Push me.

1286
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:18,140
Call, oh, close to the edge.

1287
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:22,140
Try again, not too loose my head.

1288
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:24,140
It's like a jungle sometimes.

1289
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:27,140
It makes me wonder how I keep going under.

1290
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:28,140
It's like a jungle sometimes.

1291
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:31,140
It makes me wonder how I keep going under.

1292
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:55,140
A child is born with no state of mind blind to the ways of mankind.

1293
01:17:55,140 --> 01:18:00,140
Got a smile on you and he's frowning too, because only God knows what you go through.

1294
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:02,140
You're grown in the ghetto living second, right?

1295
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:05,140
And your eyes will sing a song, because he hate it.

1296
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:07,140
The place that you pay at where you stay.

1297
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,140
Looks like one great big alleyway.

1298
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:15,140
You let my oven up for booktakers, ducks and bushes in the big money maker.

1299
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:19,140
Got a big consman of 20s and 10s and you want to go up to be just like that.

1300
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:24,140
Smellers, scammers, burglers, gamblers, pickpockets, pedellers, eat the pan hellers.

1301
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:29,140
You say I'm cool, I know food, but then you wind up, drop a night of high school.

1302
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:33,140
Now you earn it boy, all non-boy, y'all can round like you're pretty boy,

1303
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:36,140
boy, turn stick up kids, but look what you done did.

1304
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:40,140
Got a set of four eight year big, now you're man who just took it.

1305
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:43,140
Your make-tags been the next two years as an undercover fan.

1306
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:48,140
Being used in the future, so if I can't do one day, you would found her dead in the cell.

1307
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:53,140
But now that I sing the sets that song, I hide your lips so fast and die so young.

1308
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:58,140
So don't push me, cause I'm close to the edge.

1309
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:03,140
I'm trying not to lose my head.

1310
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:05,140
Drame out to flash, smelly mouth.

1311
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:12,140
I know more feedback or news items from this point in, I'm just gonna play some songs, man.

1312
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:14,140
You need to play some.

1313
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:21,140
You know, this is a song that most of you probably only know from the Muppet Show and Kermit the Frog,

1314
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:25,140
but it's originally performed as I know it by Willie Nelson.

1315
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,140
It's just such a pretty song.

1316
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:34,140
Why are there so many songs about rainbows?

1317
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:41,140
And it walks along the other side.

1318
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:48,140
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions.

1319
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:54,140
And rainbows have nothing to hide.

1320
01:19:54,140 --> 01:20:01,140
So we've been told, and some choose to believe it.

1321
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:08,140
I know they're wrong, wait and see.

1322
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:15,140
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.

1323
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:25,140
The lovers and the dreamers and me.

1324
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:32,140
Who said that every wish would be heard and answered,

1325
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:39,140
when wished on the morning star.

1326
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:46,140
Somebody thought of that, and someone believed it.

1327
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:52,140
Look at what it's done so far.

1328
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:59,140
And what's so amazing, that keeps us stargazing.

1329
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:07,140
And what do you think we might see?

1330
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:13,140
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.

1331
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:18,140
The lovers, the dreamers and me.

1332
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:23,140
All of us under its spell.

1333
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:36,140
We know that it's probably magic.

1334
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:39,140
Have you been half asleep?

1335
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:43,140
And have you heard voices?

1336
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:49,140
I've heard them calling my name.

1337
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:52,140
Is this the sweet sound?

1338
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:55,140
It calls the young sailors.

1339
01:21:55,140 --> 01:22:02,140
The voice might be one in the same.

1340
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:10,140
I've heard it too many times, too ignore it.

1341
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:16,140
It's something that I'm supposed to be.

1342
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:23,140
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.

1343
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:29,140
The lovers, the dreamers and me.

1344
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:53,140
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.

1345
01:22:53,140 --> 01:23:01,140
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.

1346
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:07,140
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.

1347
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:13,140
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.

1348
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:33,140
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.

1349
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:37,140
He really does represent what a true American is.

1350
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:39,140
Willie Nelson and the rainbow connection.

1351
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:43,140
Yes, we all kind of just like lovers and dreamers and looking for that rainbow connection.

1352
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:46,140
Deep inside.

1353
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:51,140
That's probably why I'm making such a fuss about trying to make things better.

1354
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:56,140
You always born in 1964, which is a long time ago.

1355
01:23:56,140 --> 01:24:02,140
You are constantly reminded of your age when you go to a dropdown on the web.

1356
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:08,140
You have to find yourself scrolling down much further to get to your birth date, your year.

1357
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:15,140
But so the Vietnam War took place in my very young.

1358
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:18,140
I don't remember much about other than a couple of my friends.

1359
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:21,140
The brothers were going off to Vietnam.

1360
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:26,140
But in the late 70s, there were a lot of songs.

1361
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:29,140
Particularly this song, the video clip that went along with it.

1362
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:33,140
Really showed us and taught us how horrible this was.

1363
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:35,140
And these were modern images.

1364
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:42,140
And for the first time, he was real blood and kids being blown up from the neighborhood.

1365
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:53,140
And those of you who remember that, this should probably bring back some memories.

1366
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:57,140
On Paraside.

1367
01:24:57,140 --> 01:25:04,140
We left us and made from our style.

1368
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:08,140
And we were sharp.

1369
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:12,140
As sharp as nice.

1370
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:19,140
And we were so gone whole to lay down our life.

1371
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:23,140
We came in space.

1372
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:27,140
Like tables horses.

1373
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:30,140
We left in a basket.

1374
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:34,140
As number horses.

1375
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:37,140
And we learned that.

1376
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:41,140
To travel like.

1377
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:48,140
Our arms were heavy, but our values were tight.

1378
01:25:48,140 --> 01:26:03,140
We had no hope.

1379
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:07,140
We had no sauce.

1380
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:11,140
They sent us freedom.

1381
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:15,140
They gave us love.

1382
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:19,140
We dug in deep.

1383
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:23,140
And shot unsight.

1384
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:30,140
And created Jesus Christ with all of our mind.

1385
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:33,140
We had no count.

1386
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:37,140
As you were the last game.

1387
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:41,140
We first had time.

1388
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:45,140
And we made our hostings.

1389
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:48,140
And it was dark.

1390
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:52,140
So talk at night night night night.

1391
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:57,140
And we had our sweet joy.

1392
01:26:57,140 --> 01:27:00,140
I cried so round.

1393
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:06,140
We promised our love as we rise.

1394
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:14,140
We were all around.

1395
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:21,140
We sent we all around.

1396
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:28,140
We sent we all around.

1397
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:42,140
We made our hostings.

1398
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:46,140
We made our hostings.

1399
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:50,140
We made our hostings.

1400
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:53,140
We made our hostings.

1401
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:57,140
We made our hostings.

1402
01:27:57,140 --> 01:28:02,140
We made our hostings.

1403
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:05,140
We made our hostings.

1404
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:14,140
We made our hostings.

1405
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:18,140
We made our hostings.

1406
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:22,140
We made our hostings.

1407
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:26,140
We made our hostings.

1408
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:28,140
We made our hostings.

1409
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:31,140
We made our hostings.

1410
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:45,140
The night and the night seem to last as long as it's weeks

1411
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:56,140
On fire a silent, we held the course light, they held the high light

1412
01:28:56,140 --> 01:29:03,140
And they wish you a sharpest night's day

1413
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:11,140
They had the home of the mountains, they counted the roses

1414
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:17,140
And waiting for us to arrive

1415
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:24,140
And we held the home of the mountains

1416
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:32,140
And waiting for us to arrive

1417
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:40,140
And we held the home of the mountains

1418
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:54,140
And we held the home of the mountains

1419
01:29:54,140 --> 01:30:00,140
And we held the home of the mountains

1420
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:03,140
Spilly Joel, good night's side gone

1421
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:07,140
A song about the recruits who went to Paras Island six weeks

1422
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:10,140
And then they were shipped off to Vietnam

1423
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:12,140
Many other deaths

1424
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:15,140
And when this song came out

1425
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:19,140
And I remember parents everywhere had to explain to their kids

1426
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:24,140
Because it was accompanied by a video that had the most shocking images you could imagine

1427
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:28,140
And it was really, wasn't the little green army men that we played with

1428
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:33,140
And it was really, it was a couple of years after the war I think

1429
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:38,140
And it really brought a lot back and I think it started up a whole new social conversation

1430
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:41,140
And I'm not hearing this in music anymore

1431
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:44,140
I'm not hearing about our boys and girls in the desert

1432
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:47,140
Who are being killed and blown to bits

1433
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:49,140
I'm just not hearing it anymore

1434
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:51,140
And I really, really miss it

1435
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:55,140
And maybe that's why I'm playing all of these different songs

1436
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:57,140
Because these types of messages I'm telling you

1437
01:30:57,140 --> 01:30:59,140
I just don't hear it anymore

1438
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:01,140
And a lot of the independent stuff

1439
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:03,140
But still not like this

1440
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:05,140
There's something fundamentally different

1441
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:08,140
And then a couple of years later after that

1442
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:10,140
It's unbelievable

1443
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:12,140
Now all of a sudden we were in the 80s

1444
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:14,140
We were getting electronic instruments

1445
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:17,140
We still didn't actually have digital recorders yet

1446
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:20,140
Nor did we have cell phones at that point

1447
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:22,140
It was getting close

1448
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:25,140
And all of a sudden, out of nothing comes another

1449
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:29,140
Like anti-war remembrance type thing going back to Vietnam

1450
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:33,140
But in Vietnam as the song

1451
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:37,140
And you heard Billy Joel saying we played our doorsteps

1452
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:41,140
And then we had Billy Joel who sang Good Night Saigon

1453
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:44,140
And then this must have been

1454
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:49,140
I'm going to say it was maybe 80, 81 something like that

1455
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:55,140
Out of nothing comes a song about the average age of the recruit being sent

1456
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:58,140
Over to Vietnam, which I will wager

1457
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:02,140
It's pretty much the average age of the new recruit going over to Iraq

1458
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:05,140
Afghanistan and God knows where else

1459
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:10,140
That average age is 19, Paul Hardcastle did this

1460
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:15,140
In 1965, Vietnam seemed like just another foreign war

1461
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:18,140
But it wasn't, it was different many ways

1462
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:20,140
And so were those who did the fighting

1463
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:24,140
In World War II, the average age of the combat soldier was 26

1464
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:26,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1465
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:29,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1466
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:31,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1467
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:33,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1468
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:35,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1469
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:36,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1470
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:38,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1471
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:40,140
But how was fighting the last whole thing

1472
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:43,140
And you know today, when you are alive, you're a person who's alive on

1473
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:45,140
I was really sure what was doing on

1474
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:47,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1475
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:49,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1476
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:51,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1477
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:53,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1478
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:55,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1479
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:56,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1480
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:58,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1481
01:32:58,140 --> 01:32:59,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1482
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1483
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:06,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1484
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:09,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1485
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:10,140
It was 19

1486
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:13,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1487
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:15,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1488
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:17,140
In Vietnam, it was 19

1489
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:19,140
It was 19

1490
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:22,140
In swh, mudmump, mudmump

1491
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:23,140
In 79, it's 12

1492
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:26,140
It's still 7

1493
01:33:56,140 --> 01:34:12,340
According to a veteran's administration study, half of the Vietnam Congress veterans suffered

1494
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:17,780
from what's a guy this call, post-cramatic stress disorder. Many vets complain of alienation,

1495
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:23,220
rage or guilt. It stops to come to societal thoughts. Hate to 10 years after coming

1496
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:28,220
off, almost 800,000 men are still fighting to be accountable.

1497
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,220
None of them received the heroes welcome.

1498
01:34:53,220 --> 01:35:23,220
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I

1499
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:53,220
I don't, not, I know, I know, I, know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

1500
01:35:53,220 --> 01:36:00,420
old field who you might know from tubular bells claim this was I think one of the first sample

1501
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:10,900
copyright lawsuits surrounding the song 19 by Paul Hardcastle and so he sued Paul Hardcastle

1502
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:16,340
and I think they did settle or had some money transferred but at the time Michael

1503
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:21,860
Field's manager was a guy named Simon Fuller and I think they probably got some good

1504
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:30,260
money because he wound up starting a company called 19 entertainment which has gone on to do

1505
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:36,660
such things as manage the spice girls and create the worldwide television hit series

1506
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:44,900
pop idol or American idol as we as we know it in the states so moving on a little bit more towards

1507
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:51,460
the 80s there were still plenty of songs that struck a chord with me where I thought hey man

1508
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:54,580
for the first time some lyrics actually mean something like this one

1509
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:56,740
oh yeah from prints

1510
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:04,020
so George was going on in the 80s and I climb up a money I'll tell you a story about the sign at the time

1511
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:30,180
same at home now 70 year old boys and they're beautiful it's meeting again called the

1512
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:05,460
telling you about it dying since the kid or maybe because he couldn't afford to feed it

1513
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:09,860
we'll send the people to the moon except him and my cousin tried to read for photo

1514
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:59,220
as right it is a sign at the time

1515
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:06,500
you know there was a time before Britney Spears and

1516
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:16,740
other mindless pop music reanna jalo there was there was a time when lyrics actually meant

1517
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:20,740
something and there was a message there and there was something you could kind of agree with

1518
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:26,980
and if anything we've lost ground on that we really have you know sure it's out there but not

1519
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:32,340
of the mainstream media I mean do you remember the songs and the key of life album and

1520
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:36,100
Stevie Wonder when he took you down into his village ghetto lamb

Ham leaders by Indo Sulina

1528
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:54,000
They shun wrongs the street

1529
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,000
They be tied before the war

1530
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Infected by the clear

1531
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Now some folks say that we should be

1532
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:15,000
A planet from what we have

1533
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Tell me would you be happy

From the songs in the key a light man

Because this made an impact on me man

1544
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
I was on television

1545
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
I've been on television for like three months

1546
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
And then this came out it was like

1547
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Wow

1548
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Someone gives a shit about the world

1549
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Can you name them all?

1550
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
If so you're old

1551
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,000
USA for Africa we are the world

1552
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
There comes a time

1553
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,000
When we heat a circle

1554
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:30,000
When the world must come together as one

1555
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
There are people dying

1556
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Won't it's time to lend the hand

1557
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:44,000
To light the greatest gift of all

1558
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,000
We can go on

1559
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Retending day by day

1560
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Because of some world

1561
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Soon we could change

1562
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,000
And we all will follow

1563
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Lots of great big family

1564
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
And the truth

1565
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:10,000

01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000

Beyond our dreams

1568
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Beyond our dreams

1569
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,000
We're the next one

1570
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,000
There's a choice we're making

1571
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,000
We're saving our lives

1572
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
It's time to make a better day

1573
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Just you and me

1574
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Well, I'm listening to your heart

1575
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
So they know that someone is

1576
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:52,000
And that I will be stronger and free

1577
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Just go on the show now

1578
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
And turn it so red

1579
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
And so we all must live

1580
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Let me have

1581
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,000
We are the world

1582
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,000
We are the children

1583
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000
We are the world

1584
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
For making a better day

1585
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,000
So let's not give me

1586
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Won't it's time to make a better day

It's time to make a better day

1589
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Just you and me

1590
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
We're done

1591
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
And I'll miss you

1592
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
The whole better

1593
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
But if you're just free

1594
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Stop when we can fall

1595
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
But my way

1596
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
The world

1597
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
All that it's changed

1598
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Can all become

1599
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Where we

1600
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Should have never left

1601
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Won't it's time to make a better day

1602
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,000

We're the children

1626
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
We're the children

Won't it's time to make a better day

saw my heart

1634
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Was I a dream

1635
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Me is the only honour

1636
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Tomorrow I get in

1637
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,000
So let's not give me

1638
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Girl is the choice

1639
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:39,000
We have a chance, we have a man, we say we're all alive

1640
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,000
It's true, we're like a part of the day that you need

1641
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Come on, let me tell you, we are the world

1642
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:54,000
We are the children, we are the ones who make up for the day

01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
So let's not give it, we're the ones who give it

1644
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Let's just, we're making, we're saying our lives

1645
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,000
It's true, we're like a part of the day

1646
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Just, you and me, yeah, we are the world

1647
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:20,000
We are the children, we are the ones who make up for the day

1648
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:25,000
So let's not give it, we're the ones who make up for the day

1649
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Just, we're born, we are the children, we are the ones who make up for the day

1650
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:35,000
So let's not give it, we're the ones who make up for the day

1651
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:52,000
So let's not give it, we're the ones who make up for the day

1652
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
I'm ready

1653
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Feel free to lie

1654
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I'm ready

1655
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Feel free to lie

1656
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
We are the one

1657
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
We are the one

1658
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
We are the stupid

1659
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
We are the one

1660
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
The reason for me

1661
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
To love the fuck you

1662
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Oh man, almost forgot

1663
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Great Charles saw that

1664
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Yeah

1665
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,000
He liked me

1666
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Did you not help me sing along?

1667
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Hey, it's proved

1668
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:33,000
The 25 years ago we could at least point to the continent of an Africa

1669
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
How we done so far, huh?

1670
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Yeah, it's great

1671
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:42,000
There's no even more countries in Africa

1672
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,000
With the tribes killing each other

1673
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
We've got the Chinese in there

1674
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Three quarters of a million Chinese

1675
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Raping

1676
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Just like the Europeans, the Americans

1677
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,000
We've taken everything

1678
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
I don't think anything has changed

1679
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Nothing gotten better

1680
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Children are still dying

1681
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
And we are literally

1682
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Literally eating Africa

1683
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
25 years ago

1684
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,000
That was the vibe

1685
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
We had the right spirit

1686
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
But we just fools

1687
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Did we not actually understand how this works

1688
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
And shouldn't we really try and stop it?

1689
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Isn't it really just about time?

1690
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Anyway

1691
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
I was kind of fun

1692
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Just a gem out of few songs after now

1693
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
They're going to play one more

1694
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,000
And that'll be the last one

1695
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
This is

1696
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Let's see

1697
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Well, it's a song that

1698
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I found that on the podcast of music network

1699
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,000
And I really liked the voice

1700
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,000
And it's how I feel about all of you chuckle heads

1701
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Because you really are

1702
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Individually and collectively

1703
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Quite

1704
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Embraceable

1705
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Just one look at you

1706
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,000
My heart grows tipsy in me

1707
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
You

1708
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
And you'll all

1709
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Bring out the tipsy in me

1710
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:44,000
And I love you

1711
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,000
The way you're

1712
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Is about you

1713
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I'm above

1714
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I'm with my arms around you

1715
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Don't be an option

1716
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Baby

1717
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Come to Mama

1718
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Come to Mama

1719

Come to Mama
