00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What is your password?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Your password has been accepted.

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Delta's share of Charlie.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Seven, two, two.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm bringing on a pioneering computerized ramp style.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The world wide web.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The world wide web.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is certainly going to horrify some of the people who are hitting their list and make it to this.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
From Tom and Taylor, the camera's architectures of human division.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And he dedicated his architectures for human memory.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Are you honestly going to stop him?

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Please like in the information and trust me.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Work in the way.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, insurance.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's what's the problem.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We have a great number of highly educated people who know a great deal about very little.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We're just going to horrify some of the people who are hitting their list and make it to this.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The world wide web.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The world wide web.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The world wide web.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The world wide web.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The world wide web.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The world wide web.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The world wide web.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The world wide web.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The world wide web.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The world wide web.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The world wide web.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The world wide web.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The world wide web.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The world wide web.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The world wide web.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The world wide web.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The world wide web.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The world wide web.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The world wide web.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The world wide web.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The world wide web.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The world wide web.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,320
The views are that information, so we've come full circle, but we've yet been stripped

41
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,320
up still over there.

42
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:45,720
We used to certainly don't horrify some of the people who are sitting there listening to this.

43
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,320
Initiating shutdown sequence.

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:14,880
We're 60 million dollars worth of airplay strapped to my ass, the next generation

45
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,880
of radio content in my ears.

46
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,880
I'd like to become flying you to the future.

47
00:03:44,880 --> 00:04:01,880
I just want to live, so really good that there's always a thing, so really good

48
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:13,880
that there's a thing, I just want to live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live.

49
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:22,880
I need another love system in my house, so I know when people are speaking about these people are speaking me out.

50
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,880
It's getting active everywhere that I go.

51
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,880
They won't leave you alone, this thing's they all wanna know.

52
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,880
I'm paranoid of all the people I meet, why are they talking to me?

53
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
And why can't anyone see?

54
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:50,880
I just want to live, so really good that there's always a thing, so really good that there's always a thing.

55
00:04:50,880 --> 00:05:00,880
I just want to live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live.

56
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:16,880
Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live.

57
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just

59
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,880
When we come to front, we've already seen the ones that they started to

60
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Now we expect it every way that we go

61
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,880
All the things that they said, yeah, we already know

62
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,880
I just wanna live

63
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Don't really care about the things that they say

64
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,880
Don't really care about what I just wanna live

65
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,880
Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live

66
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live

67
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live

68
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,880
Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live

69
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,880
I just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live

70
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,860
Fuck, fuck, I never even get like it

71
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,880

But respect against that power

75
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880

And keep it in my body, we just go on the same

We left the same

92
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
So what you talking about

93
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
I'm running out my mouth

94
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
I don't think we're done

95
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880
We're done in reality, we know this dream

96
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880

That you'll call when they're chosen to feel

We're real, we're out for the time

Woo!

126
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
Hey, you know

127
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,880
I really had no idea that it was that long

128
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
I was going for something totally new

129
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,880
On the mashup tip, kicking it off with

130
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
For that kind of freaky intro

131
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
From radio orphans, the worldwide web

132
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
But this mashup is like, you know, 11 minutes long

133
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Didn't quite realize that

134
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Everybody walking a daily source code

135
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Episode number 722 coming you to you

136
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
From the attic at the curry manner

137
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
And the affluent suburb of Suri

138
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
Known as Gilford, some call it a city

139
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,880
I just want to continue to call it an affluent suburb

140
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Yeah, you know

141
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,880
I kicked it off with that kind of mysterious bit

142
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Today because the news that I expected to come out

143
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
And of course we've been talking about this for

144
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
What three or four weeks now

145
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,880
Now it's all over the BBC Radio 2

146
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,880
How to Big Peace on it

147
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
What do I hear crackling here?

148
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Do you hear crackling in the sound?

149
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Oh man, I still got to stabilize all this shit

150
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,880
To the talking about the tax world-wide tax levy

151
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,880
They want to put on to non-domassiled residents of the

152
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,880
United Kingdom and my I got to tell you

153
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
You know for those of you living in the UK

154
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,880
I mean, wow, what a lot of misinformation is given out

155
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,880
So I know I've discussed this to some detail

156
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,880
I know agenda and on the daily source code

157
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,880
But what's happening now is you can hear

158
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,880
There's this complete hatred of rich foreigners who are living here

159
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,880
And apparently not paying the same taxes as everyone else

160
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Let me just set you straight

161
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,880
If you work here in the United Kingdom you have to pay taxes

162
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,880
In the United Kingdom this has nothing to do with living

163
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,880
And working here and paying taxes has nothing to do with living here

164
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,880
And paying your council taxes or taxes on any other services or goods

165
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Of course this is only if you earn money in another country

166
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,880
Where you typically would be taxed by the country that you made the money in

167
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,880
The United Kingdom now wants to tax anyone who's living here

168
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,880
Worldwide for those earnings or you can buy yourself

169
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,880
You can buy your way out of it by paying 30,000 pounds a year

170
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,880
So it is not I repeat not

171
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,880
A law made to get those rich fuckers who are not paying their taxes here

172
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,880
In fact this is the entire reason I'm going through a whole tax overhaul

173
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Because clearly we have an office here now

174
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
I'm actually really working here

175
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
I fly back and forth to California

176
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,880
But it makes sense to pay at least some of my wages taxes on that here in this country

177
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
And I'm happy to do it because I'm working here

178
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Of course I'll also be paid here which is which is the name difference

179
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Up until now it was the United States now if I wanted to bring that money in

180
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
That I was paid in the United States

181
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,880
I pay taxes on the US

182
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,880
If I want to bring it in

183
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,880
If it was sitting in my bank account for one second or longer

184
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,880
I have to pay it and it actually has to be separated out

185
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,880
It has to be very clear that there's interest that I made on that money

186
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
That is taxable when you bring it into the United Kingdom

187
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,880
So if I made after taxes a hundred thousand dollars

188
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
I want to bring it into the United Kingdom

189
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,880
I would have to pay I think four or five or tax over the four or five percent interest

190
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Or if I made more money with it then I'd pay tax over that

191
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,880
So it's really the opposite of what people are thinking here

192
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,880
It is actually the UK trying to stretch its tentacles out into other countries territory

193
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,880
And start taking tax levies from money made in other countries

194
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Which of course I believe belongs in the country where the money was made

195
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,880
Where it's spinning around in that economy

196
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,880
No need to go into it any deeper than that

197
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Just that I'm very disappointed to hear the BBC distributing such incredible disinformation

198
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,880
It was I woke up this morning right in early of course

199
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Whoops, sorry about that. You know I take out the trash myself here

200
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,880
You didn't know that didn't you?

201
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,880
And it has to be out by seven thirty otherwise you get screwed

202
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,880
Because we're first on the list for some reason

203
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
And I saw the

204
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
The

205
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,880
The missed outside I'm like oh man this is not going to be a good day

206
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,880
And then I looked at my pilot whether report and said you know what

207
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Somewhere around noon it's going to clear up and it is now actually a little bit later than expected today for the show

208
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
It's five past two

209
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Oh man another beautiful day

210
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Blue skies no clouds little bit of wind

211
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
And once again instead of flying

212
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,880
I'm here seconded off with you guys

213
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Adam you're always talking about the weather

214
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
How much you like blue skies you don't talk

215
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,880
You don't like anything but blue sky

216
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
You don't like talking about snow

217
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
You know it's the weather's always crappy

218
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,880
There's great skies and whatever

219
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Why don't you just move the California?

220
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
Seriously man

221
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,880
You should you think it was beautiful on Friday you should see it here

222
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,880
Fifty nine sixty it's going to be mid sixty today

223
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,880
The like sixty five it's beautiful man

224
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
It's been in London for like weather

225
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Move to where they have weather five

226
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
I did

227
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,880
I appreciate thought but obviously we didn't move here for the weather

228
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,880
We moved here because we wanted to be here in a different life different lifestyle different type of people different humor

229
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,880
A huge sense of irony all things that we love entirely

230
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Now I don't think we would ever have considered moving here for the weather

231
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,880
But that of course makes it that much more extra special

232
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,880
When you look at the weather and it's absolutely beautiful

233
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Comic strip

234
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Comic strip

235
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Comic strip

236
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Comic strip

237
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Comic strip

238
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,880
Checking in from the mobile conference in Barcelona

239
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,880
It is our EU correspondent the one and only comic strip blogger

240
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,880
We'll start this

241
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
I don't know

242
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,880
You're from Barcelona, I beat you

243
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Do you remember that Queen song by us alone

244
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
Of course I did

245
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
It feels this way here

246
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
So

247
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
EU news

248
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,880
The fringe fuckers have a budget deficit or in other words

249
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,880
I printing much too much Euro money

250
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
What weekends the whole currency

251
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,880
And pieces of solid Eurozone countries

252
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Anyways here in Barcelona

253
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,880
But mobile where at congress 2008

254
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,880
Formerly known as 3GSM takes place

255
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
And now also

256
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Summer weeks and turns to the dark side

257
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,880
It means Windows Mobile

258
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,880
While only Nokia remains resistant

259
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,880
To the appeal of the dark side

260
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,880
And shows more as 60 phones

261
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Powered by Symbian

262
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,880
And this time additionally with mobile TV in standard DVBH

263
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
So

264
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Adios

265
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
Muchacho peludo

266
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
You know

267
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Yeah, that is kind of interesting

268
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,880
I've been following that that

269
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Basically Windows Mobile is a huge operating system

270
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
For smartphones and mobile devices

271
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,880
And I guess it was a report that I read recently

272
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,880
That talked about getting all that crap again

273
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Just static

274
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,880
I don't know if you guys can hear that

275
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
When I listen back to the show

276
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,880
If you can't hear it, I'll never talk about it again

277
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
So apparently

278
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Nokia is licensing so much from Microsoft

279
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Including their Windows media player

280
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Technology

281
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,880
I don't know some other bits and bobs

282
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,880
People are actually questioning why they don't just take a full on

283
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,880
Windows media mobile license

284
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
And put that on to their phones

285
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,880
And of course they've made a huge investment in Symbian

286
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
So it's kind of interesting to watch

287
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
They have to strap on all these different bits and bobs

288
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
To make it compatible with the mainstream

289
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
Of course the one thing everyone really wants

290
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Is quick time

291
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,880
Which I don't think Apple licenses that to third parties

292
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
I could be wrong

293
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,880
But it certainly doesn't seem like people are integrating that

294
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
So comic strip blogger I'm sure you're checking with more

295
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,880
Speaking of cell phones

296
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,880
I got a call about a week ago

297
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,880
Someone asked me to look into the headphone jack of my previously submerged iPhone

298
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Apparently there's a little sensor in there

299
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,880
That turns a different color when the phone has met with moisture

300
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,880
I couldn't quite tell looking into my hole

301
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
But some other people know about the hole

302
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,880
Hey Adam it's Jack the podcast are formerly known as Jack

303
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
And now working in the wireless industry

304
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,880
So just to clarify there are in all cell phones

305
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,880
A moisture indicator

306
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Just typically a square or round little patch

307
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,880
Usually in the battery compartment

308
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
Which typically turns red

309
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,880
When the phone has been exposed to moisture

310
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
It doesn't have to be a dunk in the water

311
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
It could be you keep it in your waste band when you go jogging

312
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
And the perspiration has gotten in there

313
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
But we'll void the warranty

314
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,880
And typically causes the things to get completely food bar

315
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,880
So if you're sweating that much that it's filling up the hole on your iPhone

316
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
I think you got other problems other than

317
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Discolleration of a sensor

318
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
I do have that

319
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,880
And the voice of experience as I know

320
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,880
And have been for some time working in the industry

321
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Oh, male 48 middle-class

322
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Living on the beautiful suncoats west side of Florida

323
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,880
And hey, love you me and it great hair

324
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Hope you win

325
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Alright man, thank you. Love you me and the homo

326
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,880
Yeah, so I'm getting my Nokia E61

327
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,880
I hear opening up the battery compartment

328
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,880
I had licked the oh look at that

329
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Well low and behold

330
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
There were a couple episodes ago

331
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,880
I licked what I thought might be the indicator strip

332
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Well my licked has paid off

333
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Because it is now a

334
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Let's say it's like a shade of pink

335
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Kind of pinkish reddish and some spots

336
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
I only just licked it lightly

337
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,880
I mean, I'm not a real phone snogger

338
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
But I guess you're right

339
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
I didn't know that. Interesting

340
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
So if your phone meets with water

341
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,880
There's no way you can fool them

342
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,880
Oh, we learned something here

343
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
That's interesting. Of course, now I can't get my

344
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
There we go, get my phone back together

345
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
Ah, there we go. That's all good

346
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Thanks man, really appreciate that

347
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Of course, so we had

348
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,880
I had a chucklehead chucklehead

349
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,880
That's a new one

350
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
A Charlie and a chuckle chucklehead

351
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,880
We had a chucklehead a listener of the show

352
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
Call in that he was having flash problems

353
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
With his internet tablet

354
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,880
And I asked him to give me a little more proper report

355
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,880
As to what his problems were

356
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,880
I can basically help you fix anything

357
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,880
On your computer, on your cell phone

358
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,880
I'm really good at it

359
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
But when people just say, that doesn't work

360
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,880
Don't tell me what kind of cell phone

361
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
I need all kinds of information

362
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,880
What you expected to happen, what actually did happen

363
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
You know, send it in any time

364
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
So he came back and here's the redux of the flash problems

365
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
On what turns out to be the

366
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,880
And 800 with the new OS 2008

367
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
This is a real gear head moment

368
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
What's cool about us?

369
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
We also have a solution for one of the chuckleheads

370
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Adam, Chris and Levittown

371
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
With the internet tablet

372
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Flash was working

373
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
From running at 800

374
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
I don't want you to new camera on the

375
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
At 810

376
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Like a lack of a memory card slot

377
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
So I got to 800

378
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
So it was half the price

379
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
I am running the latest software

380
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
OS 2008

381
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,880
I just updated it

382
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
3 or 4 weeks ago

383
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
When I got the tablet

384
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Flash was working

385
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
Little slow little choppy could work

386
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,880
And then I started my PC

387
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
All the site stopped working

388
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
And I had to download the update

389
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,880
So I checked the tablet

390
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,880
And it too stopped working

391
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
So I had to get an update

392
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
I think this is when they went to the 8264

393
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Flash update for a flash 9

394
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Or whatever it was

395
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,880
So how do I have to apply some of the tablet

396
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
It's just a normal upgrade process

397
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,880
And my version is more comfortable now

398
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,880
But I have the latest version of OS 2008

399
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,880
So I don't know how to work around that

400
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,880
Bye

401
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Alright Chris from Levittown

402
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,880
So I got an answer for you man

403
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
And it seems to be relatively simple

404
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,880
I'm not hearing all of that

405
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
I'm thinking well you know

406
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
It could be a couple of things

407
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,880
But if he's got the flash may not perform as well

408
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,880
On the 800 as it does on the 800 and 10

409
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,880
Which of course you can purchase at a 15% discount

414
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,880
But of course it could also be something out

415
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Something much simpler

416
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
Edom is rolling from dot compass

417
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,880
You all guy who had the issue with the Nokia N810

418
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,880
On show 720 saying that the flash didn't work anymore

419
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,880
I found this on my N810

420
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,880
And if you

421
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,880
Every now and again for some odd reason

422
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,880
It decides to disable the plugins

423
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
Now to enable the plugins

424
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,880
You need to open up the browser

425
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Click on the little icon on the bottom

426
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Right hand side

427
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
Select

428
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
I think it's plugins or add-ons

429
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,880
I can't remember I've not got to open something here

430
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,880
And you go through an N9Able

431
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
Which ever plugins that you want

432
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
The most important one being flash

433
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
And then he's got it

434
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Anyway, thanks a lot

435
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
Yes

436
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880

Great hair

441
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
Thank you

442
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
Thank you very much

443
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
I appreciate it

444
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
You know I think that could actually

445
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,880
Could be the fix and look at that

446
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,880
It came up on episode number 720

447
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,880
We're taking care of it in episode number 720

448
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
I'm sorry

449
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
It doesn't get much better than that

450
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
You know what I'm saying?

451
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
At your service

452
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Daily source code

453
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,880
On Tuesday February 12 with Mike Erika

454
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,880
Screaming like a stone

455
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,880
Over the surveillance

456
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Before I know

457
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,880
I'll smooth the rock that my home got had strong

458
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,880
And I'll just look in for my home

459
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
I'll just look in for my home

460
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,880
Until I fall through the water

461
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,880
Back through the water

462
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,880
Back through the water

463
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,880
Into the clear green

464
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,880
Where I'm new trained

465
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,880
Screaming like a stone

466
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,880
Many miles traveled here

467
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
Many, many more

468
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Left to go

469
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,880
And I am never afraid

470
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
Of the things I've found

471
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,880
No, no

472
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,880
And I won't be afraid

473
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,880
If I start slowing down

474
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,880
And I'll just walk through the water

475
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,880
Back through the water

476
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,880
For you to ride back

477
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Into the clear green

478
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
And for brand new

479
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
And I don't know

480
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Where I'm going to

481
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
I just give it no

482
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,880
And take me proud of you

483
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
And believe that when I'm done

484
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,880
I know I'm going to crash

485
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,880
You saw the rest

486
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
Saw the rest

487
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
Saw the rest

488
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
Saw the rest

489
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,880
Saw the rest

490
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
You saw

491
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Fall through the water

492
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,880
Fall through the water

493
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
Fall through the water

494
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
hopes you will know to me

495
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Fall through the water

496
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,880
Take me away

497
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,880
Screaming like a stone

498
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,880
Over the sermons, before I know

499
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,880
I'm through the rock in my home, God has strong

500
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,880
And I'm just looking for my home

501
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,880
I'm just looking for my home

502
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,880
And I'm through

And I'm just looking for my home

music network track from 2006 you can find a link to that in the show notes for this program

508
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,560
at DailySourceco.com for convenience crossposted to curry.com for your enjoyment.

509
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,320
I do want to stay in the UK with a couple more stories just because the news seems to be coming

510
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:13,800
out of the UK today. More about the Northern Rock Bay allowed. This is a huge lending bank mainly

511
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:19,800
for mortgages that was hit severely by the subprime crisis although the whole, you know,

512
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:26,600
this whole shabang has been, I believe, kind of swept underneath the rug by a quick 24 billion

513
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:34,120
pound that's almost a 50 billion dollar guarantee by the Bank of England. In addition to the

514
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,560
deposits being secured, of course this is a very complicated issue and it absolutely has to do

515
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,440
with a global credit crisis and I got two actually I have one audio comment I'm going to play

516
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,680
for your first and then I have what I will just maybe a new financial savant who's checked in

517
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,280
with some real information about how all this stuff works, how all this stuff works.

518
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:59,080
I first, a bit of history on this Bank Northern Rock located in the north of the United

519
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,120
Kingdom. Hi Adam, it's a clinic Jones from right now I'm in the middle of the Worcester,

520
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:11,400
no I'm in the middle of Swindering, Wilchester. Northern Rock is to be a mutual building society

521
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,880
it used to be owned by the depositors and the borrowers but those are really

522
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:22,600
total greedy fuckets voted to be mutualised in Northern Rock building society to turn it in.

523
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:28,840
Don't hold back man, I love that. So a company and then they became shareholders as opposed to

524
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:36,840
actual owners of the company. So they they've voted themselves to become shareholders because

525
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:43,480
they want to deliver and greed. I got no sympathy with them, they put themselves in

526
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,760
that position. Wilchester, it's like I want my 50 million pounds back please. Thanks.

527
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:55,640
But I hear that my brother. For that tax that I don't have to pay that didn't actually go

528
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,080
to bailout shareholders. Although there is a contrarian view, Aryan boss I presume from the

529
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:06,360
Netherlands rights in Adam enjoyed your rant on the Northern Rock bailout on DSC 708. I have to say

530
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,600
the way you tell it makes it sound about right, however you're wrong. And here's why.

531
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:17,400
First of all, the money is not handed over to Northern Rock. It's a loan. So the tax payers will

532
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,080
get it back with interest but that's not your point nor is it mine. I will just stand still

533
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,680
by that for a second. Obviously it's a guarantee for the loans that Northern Rock has to pay.

534
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:36,520
So it is at risk. It's not a riskless loan. The real issue though and here it comes as Aryan is

535
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:42,840
settlement risk. This is interesting stuff. All financial institutions lend money to each other

536
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,600
all of the time in all times of all types of currencies. Yes, I'm aware. This is a foreign exchange

537
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:55,000
but mainly derivatives where I believe the big problem is coming from. That's me editorializing

538
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,040
by the way, continuing with Aryan's words. They do this to either earn a few cents on money. They

539
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:05,400
have temporarily available or to cover a temporary liquidity hole they might have. These periods

540
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,840
can be very short. They can be as short as a few hours but mostly they are a few days. This money

541
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,680
can go around the world in a day. In fact, they can go around the world several times in a day.

542
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,200
This of course means that the whole financial sector is very much tied into each other. So what

543
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,960
would happen if one party could not pay one of its day loans? The receiving end would be defaulting

544
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:32,360
as well as to their creditors. This is why we in banking risk management would call a system. This is what

545
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,040
we in banking risk management would call a system-wide failure. The most well known occurrence

546
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:43,800
of this is the failure of a small German bank called Bunkhausherstadt to settle their Deutschmark payments.

547
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:51,320
In a result, a whole chain effect of defaults rippled through the financial world because of

548
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,240
this default and that he has a link to it actually. I guess I'll put that in the show now. So

549
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,400
if Northern Rock would not have had that loan, it would not be able to settle their own outstandings

550
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,720
and that would result in other financial institutions getting into trouble as well. It is nothing

551
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,880
to do with shareholders, nothing to do with deposit holders, but everything with the stability

552
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:16,280
of the financial sector and that is by the way exactly the remit of the FSA, the financial

553
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:26,840
services authority and the government. Good point. So yes, the people who basically lent out our

554
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:33,240
money here in the UK and of course this happens in its own way in the United States with the

555
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,000
Federal Reserve and the Treasury printing up money and providing real low cost loans and all kinds

556
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,880
of stuff to these commercial banks is to maintain financial stability. I totally buy that, but

557
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:52,840
there has to be some kind of penalty for a commercial company who fucks up because that's what happened.

558
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:58,680
They messed up. They didn't check the loans. They were writing and it's I'm sure they didn't

559
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:04,440
check the assets backing different structured investment vehicles that were put on loan to them

560
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,360
by other institutions. This is already cost $100 billion worldwide and it's going to go much

561
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,480
much higher. So my question is should I just start a bank tomorrow and then just make money

562
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,920
until fucking blows up because there's no risk. There's no downside risk for a commercial

563
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,800
institution in this sector to go ahead and do whatever you want, try and skim it all off,

564
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,360
try and make the money, forget about doing all the diligence and checking the background,

565
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,800
just make it and if we blow up so what? In order to maintain financial stability, the government

566
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,680
and other financial organizations will step in. Well, that obviously is a problem.

567
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:48,200
So that has to be addressed. And Aryan, I would gladly gladly crown you a financial

568
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,240
savant if if you wouldn't mind calling in, record something, man. Just calling on the voicemail

569
00:31:53,240 --> 00:32:01,560
lines. That would be be quite helpful. People sending me lots of email and interesting messages

570
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,440
about civil disobedience in the United Kingdom. If we actually wanted to stand up and say, hey,

571
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:12,840
we don't quite agree with what's going on here. The best idea so far is to create flash mobs

572
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:18,520
with people wearing t-shirts that say, you work for us. I'm still really like in that idea.

573
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,840
But it could be legal and that's a point of notice. I had them just quick when I'm

574
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:30,680
protesting in the United States. It's against the rules of protesting the United Kingdom. It's there.

575
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:37,960
I think it's three. Maybe five or more in your protest. Sully glad past that as one of

576
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,920
his last pages of legislation under the anti-terrorism laws. Of course. If you want to

577
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,200
probably tell us now, you have to get the permission of the full chief council. Cheers.

578
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,480
Thanks, buddy. So you have to get permission of the police chief constable.

579
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,400
I guess what he's going to say. Sure, go ahead. Great idea. Have your protest. Now,

580
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,120
if you haven't seen it yet, please look at that awesome documentary taking liberties. It's

581
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:09,960
still on the homepage of Curry.com where I blogged the first episode. It's well worth looking into.

582
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:17,560
Because I guess you just don't have those simple liberties here in the United Kingdom.

583
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:23,240
In Patricia and I had just astounded. We moved here because we thought this was like a cool place

584
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,360
to be and now we're finding an out that it's in some ways more Snoop Dogg nation and surveillance

585
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:41,480
state thing United States is. But, of course, the United States is also up to shenanigans and

586
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:47,640
shenanigans that have to do with stuff that's going on here about putting marshals on flights

587
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,840
from the United Kingdom. Air marshals, US air marshals. And for that, of course, they want a lot

588
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,880
more information about the travelers. This, of course, is a new story that I talked about months ago.

589
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,640
I guess for some reason now, it's popping to the top of the stack. And prolific program

590
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,920
or has some thoughts on it. I got a prolific program here from San Francisco.

591
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,360
President is still been news on the guy in this morning regarding mishibush wing to put

592
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:19,800
I'm guys and all flights ever flying USS space. This is very disturbing to me because I do fly

593
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:27,320
very frequently as do you. And I believe we have the same thing about the US

594
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:33,960
new airport security rules. How long will it take them to realize that this is actually insane?

595
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:46,440
And it's not going to make the name or secure. Anyway, 28th single. We're here, hope you win.

596
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:54,520
Love you no more Chris. Thanks, P.P. Papa, Papa, prolific program are checking in with his opinions.

597
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,840
Yeah, this is, this is really going to mess up travel where you will need at least seven

598
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,480
days in advance before you can travel. So no more last minute, hop on the airplane. That'll

599
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,920
fuck up my schedule for sure. And I believe this will even happen in the US. If you are going to

600
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,840
overfly US airspace, regardless, the government wants you to be identified. And of course, this is

601
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,720
a way to bring in the national ID card. And at least this country, at least the United States,

602
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:27,240
and maybe other countries like this one as well. And it seems like oops, sorry. It seems like

603
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:34,440
stuff is just going so fast. And I have, and I have back to way a little bit from conspiracy theory

604
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,640
type stuff, you know. And now I'm just seeing, it's not a conspiracy. It's just structural.

605
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:48,600
Oh, boy, what world were my child grow up in? You really got to ask yourself. For those of you

606
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:55,720
using our pod show channels at podshow.com, I got to comment a couple of comments like this.

607
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,600
And I did what I respond to it. So check this out. I had a little steep from Boston. I wonder if

608
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:06,280
there's something called, Chad, that I'm going to call channel spam this morning. I've opened

609
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,880
up my iPod. I'm a way to work. And I found something called the best of Loita, which is not

610
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:17,160
showing up in any of my channels. And I'm sure I never asked for it to be in there. Anyway, it's

611
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:25,160
entirely in German. So let me go. And there was some other show that just appeared out of nowhere.

612
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,520
Strange thing that could happen. There are some other shows of mine that are completely not

613
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:36,360
showing up in my iTunes. But I have everything in my channel set to go to iTunes. There's the

614
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,160
presidential radio address. And I think I found that I want to view our channels. Have an

615
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,920
ever seen a show on my iPod or my iTunes. And the New York Times, Washington report. I've

616
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,400
never seen that one show up, even though they have some newer episodes of this opening. You

617
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:57,080
could help me understand that, maybe. So that's all I have for you, Red Till. I'd like to see

618
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,880
you get a haircut. I guess you just got one. And which racers are that you're hoping to win?

619
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,200
Any ready for that? Anyway. The arms rise.

620
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,920
Yeah, man. Thank you. Yeah. I got a pretty nifty haircut, by the way. I haven't touched my

621
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,200
hair for the past four days. I wake up and it's just perfect. I love it.

622
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,920
So we've been having some problems with our channels. And let me tell you what they are and what you

623
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:25,720
can expect. So there's three types of, actually, I guess four types of media currently that you

624
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,280
could have in a channel. It could be a single episode that is on the pod show network, a single

625
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:38,040
episode that is from anywhere else on the internet. So a single MP3 or MP4 or any other type of video file.

626
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,040
And then, of course, you can also subscribe to shows and then tell your channel how many

627
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,160
episodes to surface of that channel, which is and also the order in which they come out, which is

628
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:54,600
pretty cool. So there's two things you need to look at. If you put in your channel, if you

629
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:01,240
see a daily source code as the first show and then you would have the New York Times,

630
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:06,360
what is it? The Washington report as your second show and then you might have tech five as your third

631
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:13,320
show. That's the order in which they will show up on in iTunes and subsequently on your iPod.

632
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:20,200
So daily source code will be first regardless if it was released today or five weeks ago,

633
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,800
that the most recent episode for that show will be at the top of your list. So that you can always

634
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,480
play back the shows in the order that you'd like to play them back in, which is kind of cool.

635
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:39,480
We've been having a problem with the updates of external shows into the channel. It's been

636
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:47,800
sporadic and it appears that people who have older channels created a while ago on pod show

637
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:54,040
have more problems. Anyway, there's been heads down lots of work on this. I believe they've

638
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:01,080
actually decided to rewrite the entire 8,000 lines of code, which is not a lot that actually

639
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:06,200
create this functionality. So sit tight. Don't change anything with your channel. All of a sudden

640
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:11,320
it'll just start working on stuff. We'll start spouting through. Of course, I don't know where

641
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,120
what you call the channel spam is coming through because that's essentially anyone could drop anything

642
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,680
into a feed. So you might have been subscribed to a show in your channel that just decided to put a

643
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,880
German show in. That's possible, but I don't know for sure. So I'll keep you updated on that.

644
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,560
And of course, apologies that it's a little bit too large. Hey, this is a message for Adam Curry.

645
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,480
Adam, this is Sherry Miller. You played me today. Actually, I'm Tadwalk,

646
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:41,160
Pell just emailed me about it. And thank you so much. I really just want to thank you. I appreciate

647
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:48,680
it a lot. I have a new record coming out. So it really helps to really help a lot. So I just want

648
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:54,440
to extend that in person. Thank you. And hopefully we'll meet someday, really. All right,

649
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,760
have a wonderful day. Thanks again so much. Bye.

650
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:33,960
All of my life. I want it to be same day. Oh, but now I understand you got to play it all the way.

651
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:46,680
There's a child that hides a secret plane. I'm waiting in my eyes. We can see the plane.

652
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:59,880
And sometimes I just want to say you're not the only one in the world. Everyone hurts.

653
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:12,280
Everyone hurts. You're not the only one in the world. Everyone hurts. Everyone hurts.

654
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:27,080
You're not the only one in the world. I will come for you down and through the darkest times.

655
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:39,080
Oh, sometimes I will smile. I'll be right my secret scars.

656
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:56,200
Oh, sometimes I can't admit. I believe in God. I feel like I'm standing in the crowded room

657
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:04,200
with all eyes on me staring at the accused and I tell myself, hang on to the truth.

658
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:15,800
You're not the only one in the world. Everyone hurts. Everyone hurts.

659
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:30,200
You're not the only one in the world. Everyone hurts. Everyone hurts. You're not the only one in the world.

660
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:40,600
I will come for you down and through the darkest times.

661
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:51,640
Oh, even weary of this pain that's eating you alive.

662
00:42:51,640 --> 00:43:07,240
Oh, you're solitary soul that needs a little light. You're not the only one in the world.

663
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:19,560
Everyone hurts. Everyone hurts. You're not the only one in the world. Everyone hurts.

664
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:32,600
Everyone hurts. You're not the only one in the world. Everyone hurts. Everyone hurts.

665
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:48,200
The only one in the world. Everyone hurts. Everyone hurts. Everyone hurts. I will come for you down and through the darkest times.

666
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:59,960
Oh, I'm going weary of my pain.

667
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:05,720
Sharing Miller on the Podsame Music Network, the Blade. See how easy it is to get your song played on

668
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:11,400
the daily source code. Just be a girl, be cute, send me a voice mail. That's how that's all it takes.

669
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,360
And by the way, have a pretty decent collection of songs, please. Before I get out of here,

670
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,760
one more thing because I've received at least 50 different emails about it. Forget all the other things

671
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:28,280
I talked about. If this law goes into effect, then I gotta leave. This is a green paper over here in the UK.

672
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:33,480
It's a draft law. It's the three strikes you're outlaw and here it comes under this proposal.

673
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,360
UK internet users will be monitored by their ISPs for illegal downloads.

674
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,800
Those caught will receive an email warning in the first instance.

675
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,160
Internet suspension the second time and then terminate their contract on the third strike.

676
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:59,480
Oh, man. What is the world coming to? Sure. Sure. And you're only going to be looking for illegal

677
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:06,600
files, right? Not the web page as I surf too and not the email I receive. Yeah, I believe that.

678
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:13,000
Hey, everybody. It's Adam and podshow.com and staleysourceco.com. Please live your life with

679
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:20,760
passion and for as long as it laughs. That was a Freudian slip. As long as it lasts, enjoy your freedom.

680
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:29,240
Another podshow podcast. Stick it in your ear.
