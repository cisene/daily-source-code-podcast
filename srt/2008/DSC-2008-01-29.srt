00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is Sergeant Enes,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Nud Parker of the National Transportation Safety Administration,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Department of Homeland Security.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Not performing full body cavity searches.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm listening to the daily source code with Adam Curry.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Adam, is that you again in my line?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I thought I'd just gave you body cavity search.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Not just 10 minutes ago.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's what I thought.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Alright, you asked for it.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Bend over.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Here comes the daily source code.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Number seven, one, five.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I like to think I'm flying to this joint.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Fantastic, it's Adam Curry.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If you lead when you stand in everywhere you go,

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
you will bleed where you land in.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Everyone will know when you need her.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Surely you will know it was me who was standing,

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and feeling for your show.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So I've been seeing you and me as fish that can only grow.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Because everyone knows I gave you everything.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But you got the best of me.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hey, what a shame.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That was the only one who didn't know what you had done to it.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hey, what a shame.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Because all you ever do was blame.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If you were for illusion,

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
pause it on the frame.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You can draw the conclusion.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Everyone's the same.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I was a fool from the get-go.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And you would take a sea of the things I should let go.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Since then I don't need anyone.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll be seeing you and me as fish that can only grow.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Because everyone knows I gave you everything.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But you got the best of me.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hey, what a shame.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I was the only one who didn't know what you had done to it.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hey, what a shame.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because all you ever do was blame.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hey, what a shame.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And with my cowbells.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You got the best of me.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hey, what a shame.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I was the only one who didn't know what you had done to it.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't care what I say, y'all

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I gave you everything, you got the best of me

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hey, what a shame

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I was the only one who didn't know what you had to say

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What a shame

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
How you ever do is blame

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Sister Hazel from the Podsake Music Network

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Shane, they're from Florida

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Think of the show notes of dailystorescode.com

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's stealth and share of Charlie episode number 715

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It is Tuesday, January 29th

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Is it 29th already?

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What happened to January?

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What did it go?

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Sitting here in the Curri condo

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Overlooking the access ramp to the Bay Bridge

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And looking at the tower of death because I do have a different set up

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm not at the Bay Bridge right now that I'm fully on the Mac

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
With Ableton Live

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Thank you so much for sending in comments

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Suggestions about the sound quality

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Once I get the MIDI controller in place

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It'll be a lot better obviously because I'm still kind of using the mouse

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
To basically control the faders

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Not the easiest way I think to do in the world

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I hope you had a good weekend

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Oh man, it's going to be another week here in San Francisco

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
More meetings, more stuff

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm actually feel pretty good

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I feel reasonable despite the long hours

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And getting a real early

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And basically not knowing where my body is

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
935 in the evening right now

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Sitting at the dining room table

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
As I've taken over the new spot here

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You guys watched television recently

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I just hadn't turned it on since I've been here

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I turned it on and it's like nothing

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's like repeats and apple ads

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's all I'm seeing

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
See a lot of ads for the apple air

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Their new laptop

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And then just repeats

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I mean if I were network executive

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm looking at the fox right now

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
At least I have it on the background

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
If I was a network executive

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And I needed to go and repeat stuff like house

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Which I think is actually a brilliant series

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I really like watching that

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Why do the Christmas episode?

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It puts me off immediately

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's a repeat, it's freaking Christmas

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Just doesn't make any sense

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What is making sense my friends

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And a lot of you have been sending in comments

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And I really appreciate it

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm starting to understand the demographic profile

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Of the typical daily source code listener

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And guess what?

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
There is no typical demographic

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Of the daily source code listener

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It seems like we've got 20 year olds

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And 40 year olds

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No one who's anywhere in between

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Has called up or written in yet

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But a lot of interesting people

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Hey, I'm just cold

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm going to try again

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Just a look is

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And on your last show

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You're just asking about the age and demographics

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Of your audience

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So I'll just tell you a little about myself

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm 22 and male obviously

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
As most listeners are

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm going to college for management information

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Wait a minute

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's what you say

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm hoping that there's some women around

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
System so that I graduate this fall

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And I just think that

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Imagination is probably a great one of the end

137
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Because I've been around for the

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Since I've been born

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We've seen the rise of the internet

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And the rise of cell phones

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And I'm probably far the last generation

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It didn't actually

143
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,320
grow up their entire life having all that stuff around them and it's just awesome to

144
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,160
think about how much change has happened in just the last 10 years in technology

145
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:55,640
was it's just awesome anyway I've got more to say about other things you've

146
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,680
been talking about but I won't bore you anymore I'll say it for another day.

147
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
Another day.

148
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Alright man thank you.

149
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Appreciate it.

150
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,480
So I can to we got a new VP of sales at Pod Show is named Chris Little that's a very

151
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:16,240
interesting guy and knows a hell of a lot about advertising and sales and he's but

152
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,160
he's also like a lot of really good sales guys I'll just say sales guys for a second

153
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,440
here because we also have sales girls, sales girls, sales girls, y'all.

154
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,760
You know very masculine type guy and you know there's a lot of I would have to say

155
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,680
a particular vocabulary that say it that kind of like what kind of come in a way and

156
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,680
I don't want anyone to take this the wrong way but in a way they're also great sales

157
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,000
guys are like great traders on Wall Street and you know what I'm saying and so really

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,400
really to the point and in your face with what they're saying and so we're talking

159
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,440
about you know I said it you know Chris you know this is really interesting I've got a

160
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,040
I mean I've been asking people about about who they are and and what demographic profile

161
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,040
they fit into and seems like I got 20 year olds 40 year olds they're all kind of

162
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,320
interested in one out of all but most seem to be interested in technology one way or the

163
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,560
other and he said yeah oh totally man you got Jack and Jill's I said what you got Jack and

164
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,320
Jill's listening like what is that mean apparently Jack and Jill is a term in the advertising

165
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:33,160
business where Jack is a guy who's usually in IT or tech or is making a lot of money or by

166
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:41,080
regular standards a lot of money and Jill is always looking for the right Jack because Jill

167
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,320
wants to sub zero freezers in the micro is this is real advertising speak right but just crack

168
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,160
me up to think that because I got this visual of all you guys out there you know you're all Jack

169
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,720
and Jill's so here's a Jill actually Gene I should say Adam what is this you say no

170
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,000
chicks listen to the show don't forget me American chicken Holland I wrote it in before oh

171
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,640
and I'm 30 years old by the way there you go exception to the rule love the show keep it up

172
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:15,000
but don't forget chicks do in fact listen to okay now I like that I'm not allowed to ask for

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,760
naked pictures anymore as you know my wife has forbidden me from from doing that but I was thinking

174
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:31,000
it for sure hello Adam curry this is Mark thank all I am amazed at the Ron Paul supporters

175
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:41,480
in my local community there are so many Ron Paul banners flying everywhere in our house

176
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:49,880
and I'm amazed by that because I haven't seen a single Hillary Clinton banner I haven't seen a

177
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:59,960
single became nobody except for Ron Paul I think that's good news my friend

178
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:10,040
I love you Adam curry bye yeah you didn't actually tell me where you're from but that's

179
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,640
for sure the Ron Paul supporters and it seems like we're we're getting stronger and gaining more

180
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:21,480
momentum if you didn't know already we're going for the gold we want to raise five million dollars

181
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,720
for Dr. Ron Paul's campaign by February fifth which of course is a super Tuesday it's coming up

182
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,480
this Tuesday go to RonPaul 2008 dot com and donate let me see how he's doing actually haven't

183
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,040
I haven't looked recently let me just this is kind of weird I only have one monitor now

184
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:50,840
so he used to to multiple monitors gosh let me see let's see Ron Paul 2008 see where we are

185
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:58,680
going for the gold five million wow wow what is he up to now three point seven oh we'll make

186
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:06,120
five million easy oh that's great that is fantastic I'm very happy about that and I'm really

187
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:14,360
happy for for a couple of specific reasons the extremely attentive and yes in some cases fanatic

188
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Ron Paul supporters have been mailing in and this is this really irks me let me just

189
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:29,240
bring up this email this is in regards to the BBC the BBC have the US election poll tracker

190
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,880
and it's I guess it's a flash widget let me see yeah it's a flash widget on this page of course

191
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,480
I'll put a link to it in the in the show notes a daily source code dot com so you can click on

192
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,600
Democrat and then you see the candidates and then there's you know like the poll numbers and

193
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,840
it's a it's a real nice graph stuff but but here's what's interesting and this was brought to my

194
00:12:50,840 --> 00:13:00,040
attention by uh Brennick Jones says hey Adam check out this BBC news webpage it contains absolutely

195
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,800
no mention of Dr. Paul I wrote an email to the BBC below asking WTF is going on except I was

196
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,440
more polite and also more pointed can't believe their response well first let me tell you what

197
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,400
what the deal you always with this so the Democratic candidates on this poll tracker are Hillary Clinton

198
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:21,160
John Edwards and Barack Obama so they've got three in the race if you click on the Republican side

199
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:29,000
and it's loading up here you have Mike Huckabee Fred Thompson, Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani

200
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,840
and John McCain Fred Thompson dropped out of the friggin race he's he's not even he's he's with

201
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:43,080
drawn so of course the point is that Ron Paul is not listed so Brennick sends an email and says hey

202
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,640
I'm puzzling up set the BBC news website is chosen to ignore Dr. Ron Paul from the list of

203
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,160
Republican candidates whilst the full Democratic possibilities are shown what can this mean is this

204
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:59,160
an active sabotage censorship or just complete an utter incompetence to miss out just one

205
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:06,280
candidate deliberate or accidental deliberately surely here's their response I'll I'll I'll do the

206
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,840
BBC a voice come so good at it thank you for your email regarding the amount of coverage devoted

207
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,400
to particular candidates it is of course a judgment call it's better that we have not covered

208
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:23,080
Mr. Paul to any great degree I'm sorry it is true that we have not covered Mr. Paul to any great

209
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,440
degree although we have mentioned him in several articles if he continues to do well or better

210
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,160
than expected we will certainly devote more space to him his policies and his campaign

211
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:41,240
bullshit I say, bullets on you all that's such horseshit you know and this just this just really

212
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,840
show and by the way I don't believe in any conspiracy that the BBC is you know trying to keep

213
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:52,360
Ron Paul they're just stupid they're dumb tools they just copy shit from around the world they

214
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:59,160
don't actually do any investigation you know if what a contradictory message that is he came in

215
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:05,720
second you know the guy is he's definitely on the map and I'm sorry how can you have Fred Thompson

216
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:12,680
up there if he's withdrawn from the race and not have Ron Paul total total bullet bullet

217
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,920
bullets shit that's what I'd call it can you tell him a little bit tired and then I got this other note

218
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:27,560
this is also pretty lame very typical just opening up the Gmail message here

219
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,760
from George Adam greatly appreciate your support and official endorsement of course

220
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,840
Ron Paul for president great to see so many endorsements coming to Ron Paul despite the

221
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:42,520
media's lack of attention MTV in alliance with my space is running their debate form on February

222
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:49,320
second in an absolute stab in the back of young people MTV is decided to exclude Dr. Paul

223
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:55,080
from the mix while still inviting the extremely lagging Rudy Giuliani who has half the votes

224
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,440
that Ron does in the primary and caucus season as you probably already know I figured with your

225
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,920
time at the channel if you were to bring it up and become out spoken on it we could get this

226
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,680
corporate bias BS out to more people nice way people just because you worked on the station bubble

227
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:17,320
and of course he says well this this is probably a hit job put out by Viacom and it's medium

228
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,760
conglomerate friends news corp and maybe maybe look they're just looking for sex appeal

229
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:30,760
and honestly Ron doesn't have sex appeal you know Giuliani's local to New York so that's easy

230
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,560
you know they just invite him he just hops in in a government vehicle and drives on over

231
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:47,000
but yeah that's lame let me see who was it the thought MTV was cool I don't think they've been

232
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,800
that in a long long time anyway we'll continue to support Dr. Ron in the independent media we'll

233
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,680
get him his $5 million and we'll continue to support him super Tuesday could be very interesting that's

234
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:05,400
when for those the outside the US that's when a whole mess load of states do their caucuses

235
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:12,440
in the and do their primary voting and that's really the day when when we hope to see Dr. Ron

236
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,960
move ahead and by the way I did have you know maybe it's just a wishful thinking or a dream but

237
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,480
somewhere in the back of my mind something was scratch and saying you know if he doesn't get the

238
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:28,040
Republican nomination I have a feeling that with all the momentum and and everything that's happening

239
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:34,280
I think he can't can't do anything but run as an independent I believe people will really rally

240
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:40,920
around him and almost almost force him into it and he could do it because really all you need

241
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:47,640
is just tons and tons and money and the reason why he's been with the Republican party besides

242
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,320
the fact that he feels he's a true Republican which I think there's a lot of merit to that statement

243
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,160
is because there's no way to get into the debate if you're not affiliated with either of the big

244
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:06,920
two parties of course it's clearly not a guarantee oh whoa is me yeah this has been from Oakland

245
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,160
I'm one time missing sorry I'm calling I just thought I'd give a call sounds like you have an opening

246
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,560
for financial or economic advanced I yes indeed we do no word from the nylon so he's I think

247
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:22,200
he's a slit off the bar stool and given up his slides leave me a quick message a couple questions yet

248
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,240
I'm trying to show first of all you had asked what the official definition of a recession was

249
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,440
yes indeed I think it was a couple people are saying that we're in a recession as comics

250
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,840
were blogger keeps saying it's a what is the official definition of a recession a lot of people have

251
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:44,040
their own kind of colloquial definition of the official definition is a two consecutive quarters

252
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:50,120
of negative growth in GDP kind of a tough thing to do but happens from time to time and the

253
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,320
other weird thing about recession is you don't know you're in one until you're in one because

254
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,680
the whole two quarters of consecutive declining period okay so are we actually in one at this point

255
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,000
also you said stuff about the said and how they control interest rates and you think you're

256
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,760
given a little too much credit there that's a lot like saying that Microsoft and Intel can

257
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,720
completely control what goes on in the technology industry wow that's not exactly what I meant

258
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:24,120
but I think it goes beyond interest rates they're the guys that actually maybe maybe I should

259
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,400
shut up and listen to this to the expert you are the new savant my friend let me just go take a

260
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:37,240
back seat that has absolute control over one interest rate alone that's kind of discount rate is

261
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,400
the rate at which banks will end to other banks that also has a fed fund target rate this is

262
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,960
the rate at which the federal and two other banks but this only a target on that control that

263
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,560
through open market activities buying and selling bonds all of their interest rates are determined

264
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:01,320
by market forces and kind of supplying demand so hope that helps keep up the great show and

265
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,400
yeah we'll talk to later thanks man and call in any time you you hear by our best out with the

266
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:17,880
crown of official savant of the charlie and nylon could suck it yeah I've been keeping up I've been

267
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:25,320
watched I think I think it's just a great headline right now you know the you know the stories

268
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:31,320
about recession but the fact is I think wall you know Wall Street is rebounded the shorts of all

269
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:39,160
covered it's just uncertainty it's just you know basically it's it's the banks not trusting each other

270
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:46,200
that's that's the biggest problem right now and I think we're we're now in ining I'd say it's almost

271
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,680
time for the seventh ining stretch of this of this crises and we will come out of it and I don't

272
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:56,680
think we'll actually go into recession because that's that's yes technically it's two quarters

273
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:03,800
of downward growth is that we saw or or loss of GDP when I've even forgot the definition but

274
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:10,040
it's also just a mindset it truly is oh speaking of mindset man I hope in my big fat mouth about

275
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:17,160
this trial that time Warner cable is doing in uh Beaumontaxis lovely Beaumontaxis for

276
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,040
meatard bandwidth and I just want you know because I got a couple comments here which aren't really

277
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:28,440
pretty I just want you to understand that I believe that the meatard bandwidth situation

278
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:37,400
is not going to be about overages I mean there are certain ISPs have had it myself

279
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,000
where if you go above a certain amount of bandwidth per month then they they either they

280
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,240
cap you off and they start to give you shitty bandwidth or you start paying and you know an

281
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,560
exorbitant amount per gigabyte transfer or even per megabyte in some cases excuse me

282
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:04,520
I believe that and we go to a truly meters situation I believe that you you know all of these numbers

283
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,880
have to change I think I truly truly think at the end of the day it's going to be better for the

284
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,760
consumer you'll find that you're going to be paying about what you're paying today for the usage

285
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:21,160
you know that you apply to the network but that the people who are really sucking down tons and tons

286
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:27,800
of of huge media files and are running bit torrent and you know just our um and other peer

287
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:33,160
to peer programs they're just going to wind up paying more and I have to tell you I'm all for it

288
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:39,320
but this is not about taking the current pricing structure and applying some kind of overages to it that

289
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,520
of course would be horrible and that would suck that's also not what I'm advocating I also don't see

290
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,720
how that can happen because there would be a revolution a revolt and there would and competition

291
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,600
somehow would come into it or you know or would just shut down the internet maybe hi Adam this is Justin

292
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:04,280
I respectfully have to say fuck you tell me that I should have to uh have meter bandwidth man that's

293
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,880
just not cool I pay something like uh $60 or somewhere around there a month right how much

294
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,640
ban with do you use for that 60 that's what I'd like to know in fact we should be able to meter that

295
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,920
right why don't we all check and see how much we're we're downloading I'll make it concerted effort I

296
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,120
maybe I can do that at the router level I guess maybe my my Wi-Fi router I can I can set it to zero

297
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,080
hopefully and then see how much ban with I actually use on a monthly basis and then calculated back

298
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:40,600
because I pay about the same about 60 bucks US for for for for the bandwidth now it's it's unlimited

299
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,640
as far as I know I've never got an overage charge um and but that should be enough that should be

300
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,680
enough for me to do all the things I want to do but of course I'm not running continuous you know

301
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:56,680
ban with sucking programs although some of my neighbors clearly are because band as I get messed

302
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:03,240
up once in a while but okay the fuck you was received to download all the content that I want

303
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,040
and I don't want to have to worry about overages like I do with my cell phone I would have that

304
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,000
in the back of my mind and I just I just don't want to worry but then again on the other hand I

305
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,400
have to listen to what you tell me because Pod show is able to host my Podcaster free

306
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:23,480
was no downtime that I've been made aware of so you're doing something right yeah and it's free to

307
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,080
you but it's not free to us I mean it actually does cost money if someone accesses your file and so

308
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,400
one listens to your show or watches your show whatever it is what show is it by the way you should

309
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,040
tell me and you must know what you're talking about time you want my show to succeed so there

310
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:44,360
must be something that will fold you understand and if I was afraid of running out of bandwidth

311
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,400
though I'd probably be less likely to try out new shows new Podcast dude just would always be

312
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,280
there in the back of my mind what's the luck in the UK or the Netherlands I don't want to

313
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,400
sound like a stupid uninformed American and come across like I'm afraid to change if it's

314
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,200
it's working somewhere else maybe Germany's doing this why don't we try it out like they're doing

315
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,040
and remind me of the days back when you'd have to drive around to the end of your driveway

316
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,600
because you had run out of bandwidth no it wasn't bandwidth there's a little long ago it was

317
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:22,120
quite that it wasn't quite that they love you no homo great hair 33 yeah uh my stock

318
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:33,800
strapping anymore I maybe a hobo no homo emohobo god remember that one yeah um no when that's

319
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,520
when we just moved to the UK and I actually couldn't get a connection so that nothing

320
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,120
to do with overages or anything like that what if just what if it turns out that you only

321
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:51,480
needed to pay 40 bucks a month on a meter bandwidth plan you know the fact of the matter is

322
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,400
we've we've kind of been hoodwinked by by this advertising about unlimited bandwidth which of

323
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,960
course it's not I mean that's the real problem is truth and advertising if you advertise unlimited

324
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,520
bandwidth it's unlimited bandwidth and if it's a little asterix then your full of shit but I

325
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,480
believe just looking at the prices and I and I do think I know a little bit about how it works

326
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,560
and what it actually costs because you know if someone's downloading a lot and you got a lot of

327
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,520
people downloading a lot then somewhere along the line something has to be upgraded so we need

328
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:26,840
a new router or new switch or a new line or extra capacity brought in so it's not free for the

329
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:32,280
the people delivering the bandwidth to your home um but it could just turn out to be not that's why

330
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:37,960
I disclose some of the pricing for for gigabytes that's being charged on the other end of the

331
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:45,320
pipe like on our end where we send stuff out you know it's blown nine cents per gigabyte oops what

332
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:52,280
was that that was weird oh boy let's just hope it hangs together um yeah it's less than nine

333
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:58,520
cents per gigabyte it's actually transferred so it could turn out that you might be paying a 20 or 30

334
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:05,320
bucks instead of 50 or 60 it's actually could pan out that way so I'm not I'm just not jumping

335
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,840
to conclusions about this meaded ban with being all about overages which I don't believe time

336
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,480
Warner has said at all they've just said they're experimenting with different types of

337
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,280
meadering if anyone lives in Beaumont, Texas or if you know anyone who lives in Beaumont, Texas

338
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:25,880
it might be a part of the plan could you please give me a call I'd really appreciate it

339
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:32,600
Adam Curry you really really really need an education on what teering means all right

340
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:40,840
no company on planet earth will make demands to change to a system that will reduce their income

341
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:48,120
oh hold on a second I got to stop you right there you're taking this meaded ban with

342
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:55,880
conversation to the company wants to make less money oh that's just ridiculous dude

343
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:03,160
has nothing to do with it it's just not gonna happen and never gonna happen you sound like one of

344
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:09,800
those guys who suck in the ban with pipe all night long but here's structure that is fair to the

345
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:15,320
customer will result in significantly lower money for the companies

346
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,840
so you're about it the industry standards 10 cents a gigabyte that's what I as a consumer can buy

347
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,480
without buying a ball I could buy one gig at 10 cents yeah that means if I've done it

348
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:31,800
a 500 gigabyte of data which is more than twice the cutoff point that heavy users are hitting

349
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,200
1225 gigas a year the cutoff point a lot of users are hitting when they get cutoff from the

350
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,760
internet then they won't tell you what the limit is that's twice as much that's only 50 bucks a month

351
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:49,640
dude it's called a commodity that's what it is it's a commodity so yes commodity prices go down

352
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,800
over time particularly this type of commodity absolutely that will happen well it wants it look

353
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,040
it's not gonna happen for everybody you're conveniently taking out of the mix the people who are

354
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:06,280
sucking up tons of ban with all day and all night who also may not be paying hundreds they may be

355
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,680
paying 50 or 60 we just don't know we don't have all the information but it is interesting

356
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,800
that at least these trials are being put into place and if we can get some more information so

357
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:21,800
just rambling around then we could actually make some informed or could have an informed conversation

358
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:29,320
about it but anyway let's listen what I'll check to say I'm paying 65 dollars a month for internet

359
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,640
access do you tell me there's a lower my bill to below 50 dollars a month that could be over there dead

360
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:47,000
fuck hey it's making a sound like the man yeah good bellow not everyone's out to screw you

361
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,920
continuously they're doing that I truly believe the ISPs are trying to figure out how to make it

362
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:58,920
a little bit fair for everybody and we have to get there it's like you know maybe a better

363
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:06,280
analogy is the road okay so you're driving I'm looking at the the on-ramp to the bay bridge actually

364
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:12,440
that's the off-ramp that I'm seeing and we actually cars and once a while I'll see an SUV and then

365
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,480
then I'll see a truck I mean aren't there different pay scales in what these vehicles have to pay in road

366
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:26,760
tax and and registration taxes aren't there different tiered pricing schedules in that for the type of

367
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:33,320
use that you're making of the road I mean a truck or time weigh in on this man what do you pay

368
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,440
do you pay more for your for your rig than what you're paying for your for your car and is that

369
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:44,680
because of the size of it and the weight of it and the how it taxes the infrastructure and you know

370
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,760
it's it just makes sense the second problem there is no such thing it's competition

371
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,520
you say well somebody that's coming to you right no they won't do you know how many internet

372
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:03,720
providers are available to me one yeah now you do have a point there of course that's not the same

373
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,160
situation for everybody I think I have a couple choices here in San Francisco those choices will

374
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:15,720
expand I do believe that they'll expand their number of a number of ways and wireless choices are

375
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:22,040
bound to expand but it could take another five years could easily be ten years but it will eventually

376
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:30,520
happen and that all is down to you my friend the consumer to put pressure on companies and if necessary

377
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:36,760
on congress that's where they're there for precisely one I don't piss off comets because of the

378
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:42,360
only one I have unless I want to pay ninety bucks a month for a piss ass whoa a satellite connection

379
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:48,440
now hold on you do have a choice you got a choice there it's not a great choice but you got a choice

380
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:56,360
true or not with so much latency that I can never do anything live he you have no idea the

381
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,800
reason you want to switch to tears structure so they can what they're going to do is they're going

382
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,120
to find out what the average balance of their average user is and that balance is going to cost

383
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,400
whatever we're paying now and then all of us who actually use our internet connection or it's

384
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:15,960
well so you don't actually know that you're just making it up it could be it's a possibility

385
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:22,360
but boy what a stupid way out for those guys and you don't have to test that in uh

386
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,800
boom on taxes we already know how that works now I think they're trying something new again if you're

387
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:35,160
in boom on we got to hear from you big dime so trust me to your internet is not the way to go

388
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,080
everything else is going away from here in the that every single industry where they had a

389
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:44,200
tears structure the customers got screwed every single one still a phone bills were a couple of

390
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:51,640
years ago come on man that's right that's that's a great example look at what phone bills were

391
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:57,400
a couple of years ago and where is it today you can't argue that there haven't been tons of deals

392
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:05,080
tons of different ways to to to get the type of package that fits for your profile of usage

393
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,600
that's what these weekend and evening minutes are all about and you're five friends that you know that's

394
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:17,880
packaging that's marketing that is truly how American enterprise works when bringing more value

395
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:26,120
to the customer and it's part competitive and oh it's actually it's all competitive there's there's

396
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:31,960
the point right there you know I used to pay a lot more for cell phones in fact look what happened

397
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,480
in Europe with the with roaming charges you know they were trying to shaft the customers with

398
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:44,120
that and the government stepped in said wait a minute why because of pressure from consumer

399
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:49,480
work in the system where there isn't a reasonable control of what you pay online do you get

400
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,520
balance from anybody so they have to compete but you have one type going to your door there's no

401
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:00,200
competition and no incentive to be fair to you they will screw you see I had a Christmas

402
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,400
all right Chris in love at town so that's your situation but of course time warners not just in

403
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,240
your town is the only one they're all over the place so we'll see what happens we'll see how it shakes

404
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:15,160
out but I just don't think it's all that bad oh no fellow airman calling in and I'm this a woman

our new video podcast I've just learned about you and all you've done for podcasting just recently

460
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:55,240
in September when I attended the podcast expo in Ontario and your show has been a lot of fun to listen

461
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,960
to for me and it's certainly been part of our inspiration to do our own show we're just getting

462
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,720
started with something then I think it's a one of a kind at this time my wife and I do a show called

463
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:12,520
the sweat cast that's right this is an attractive title my friends wet cast and we broadcast six days

464
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:18,360
a week on use stream from our home gym as we do our daily workout we've been doing our first seven

465
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:23,800
shows from the treadmill and the stationary bike and then we'll soon be incorporating strength

466
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:30,360
training into the show as well we publish the show as an MP4 file via our RSS feed and we play

467
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:37,560
upbeat pod safe music from music.podshow.com we discuss urban legends tell a joke or two and then we

468
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,360
close the show with the recording about the same to the day yep we're also big fans of Father

469
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:49,480
Roderick's daily breakfast this what cast is targeting baby boomers Adam in their 50s and 60s

470
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:55,080
people that maybe don't normally listen to podcasts with a positive message about the importance

471
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:02,360
of exercising especially in your retirement years and those years leading up to retirement it's kind

472
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:07,800
of a fun way for boomers to get back in shape by subscribing to the podcast and taking it along

473
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,720
to the gym who knows it might just be the reason to get mom or dad a video iPod for their birthday

487
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:44,200
25th anniversary of Michael Jackson's thriller when he released the thriller album and the record

488
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:53,720
company has commissioned Joseph who's who's been around creating audio and really before podcasting

489
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:00,440
out have to say he has own little company and and he's taken it upon himself with this for this 25th

490
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:09,480
to produce a series of thriller cast with a list of interesting people who either

491
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:17,240
no Michael Jackson or in the music business and I'm not quite sure well somehow he came upon my name

492
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,560
and he asked me to participate and what I want to do is I just want it because he sent me the

493
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:27,960
what we did is we did like a double ender so he called me on the phone and we talked and I recorded

494
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:33,560
my part of the conversation so that he had a you know a reasonably good quality copy of

495
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,800
me talking just I play a little bit of this because when these things drop when this starts I think

496
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:44,600
it's gonna be a great series so this is a part of my thriller cast I'm ready let me just check let me
