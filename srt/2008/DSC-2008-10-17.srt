DeltaSharrade Charley Seven Niner Niner.

00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,680
All right, everyone!

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:28,720
A one, two, zero

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,720
I like to think I'm flying into this journey

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,720
I'm testing this very great

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,720
Ow!

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,720
Ow!

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,720
Ow!

00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,720
Ow!

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,720
Ow!

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,720
Ow!

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,720
Ow!

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,720
Ow!

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,320
Oh, youогоz!

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,880
Eat it, yeah, eat it well!

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,000
Whole bit of trash on a needle!

17
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,720
Always only, just fly behind the wind

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,720
I'll dare to see a little bit of nell over there

19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,720
I'll do fine

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,720
id struggle may, If you must freakin' run out of who you haw!

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
Don't let me feel it, take both

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
Ouch!

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,720
Ouch!

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,720
It's in this room

25
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,720
It's in this room

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
Can he?

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
I'm called the nation

28
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,720
It's in this room

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,720
I thought you'd have a sailor back to

30
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
Rock my soul

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,720
No, no, no, no, no

32
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,720
Who's that?

33
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,720
That thing

34
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,720
I'm like a mini mouse

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
I'm real

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,720
Oh, nice

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,720
Ready, oh

38
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Keep all of this through

39
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,720
Go back to the room, so

40
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,720
Oh, not that as

41
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,720
You're waiting

42
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,720
On that door

43
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,720
And a heart of rain

44
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
You might have to walk my life

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,720
Into a big hole

46
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,720
But every night is waiting

47
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,720
Over time

48
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,720
Should we get away from

49
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Yeah

50
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,720
I'm alive

51
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,720
It's in this room

52
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,720
It's in this room

53
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
It's in this room

54
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,720
It's in this room

55
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,720
It's in this room

56
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,720
It's in this room

57
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
Yeah

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,720
I don't have a sailor back to

59
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,720
Oh, I'm alive

60
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,720
It's in America

61
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Oh, I'm alive

62
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
It's in America

63
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
Oh, I'm alive

64
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
It's in America

65
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
Oh, I'm alive

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
It's in America

67
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
Oh, I'm alive

68
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,720
You may not be

69
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Looking farther from a flame

70
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,720
But you might not escape away

71
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
On that door

72
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,720
And a heart of rain

73
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,720
I'm alive

74
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,720
It's in this room

75
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,720
It's in this room

76
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,720
It's in this room

77
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
It's in this room

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
It's in this room

79
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,720
It's in this room

80
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
It's in this room

81
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
It's in this room

82
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Yeah

83
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,720
I don't have a sailor back to

84
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
Yeah

85
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Yeah

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
I don't have something

87
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,720
I don't have anything

88
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,720
I don't have anything

89
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,720
I don't have anything

90
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,720
I don't have anything

91
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,720
I don't have anything

92
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,720
It's in America

93
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:38,720
I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I

94
00:04:38,720 --> 00:05:08,720
I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in sini and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night, and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night and I'm in the night

95
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,720
was a killer, particularly because I lost two full days in travel.

96
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,720
And well, here we are, it's the third day of the week, I'm sorry.

97
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
It is, of course, Friday.

98
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,720
So it's a footballer Friday on the Charlie,

99
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
extra long show for you.

100
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,720
And I'm in the curry manner here in good ol' blighty.

101
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Only for a bit, though.

102
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,720
I'm kind of on a massive swing around.

103
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,720
There's a, I can't tell you what it is, because it's,

104
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,720
I, anyway, it's someone might be listening.

105
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,720
I can't really tell you what's going on, but there's a family thing we're doing.

106
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,720
So that's why I came back.

107
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
So we're traveling just a little bit over the weekend.

108
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Then Monday, back to San Francisco,

109
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
because there's still plenty of work to do.

110
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Plenty of things to see.

111
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,720
I'm going to be in Los Angeles the weekend after next.

112
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Oh, man.

113
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,720
It's, it's, it's crazy.

114
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,720
But, nonetheless, you guys have once again prepared a fantastic show for me.

115
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,720
I feel extremely privileged because, oh, wow, I see that,

116
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
oh, this is not good.

117
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,720
The, it looks like the battery on my, my fader fox.

118
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,720
That's the, that's the, the MIDI controller I used to control the Ableton live software,

119
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,720
which by the way, I'm finally getting it around to showing you guys exactly how all that works.

120
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
I think the batteries are low, so everything's like flashing.

121
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
I hope it'll make it through this show.

122
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,720
In fact, I might have to even have to run downstairs and get some fresh batteries.

123
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
Anyway, a proper food bar Friday.

124
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
It's all lined up.

125
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
This is the stuff that you guys have been leaving at the drop.

126
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
The drop.au slash daily source code.

127
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Some good comments.

128
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Lots of individual really cool YouTube videos to play for you.

129
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Of course, as it pertains to the financial meltdown.

130
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
And, you know, it's listening to that song.

131
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,720
And actually, I chose living in America because it kind of reminds me of a time that we won't see again for a long, long time.

132
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Remember how carefree we were when that song came out written by the way by Dan Hartman and Charlie midnight.

133
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Song by, of course, Mr. James Brown himself.

134
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Remember those were crazy good times, right?

135
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
And we, it was a living in America.

136
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
Couldn't be any better.

137
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Well, those days are definitely over chocolate heads.

138
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Because I see nothing but hard times ahead.

139
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Not, not something we can't overcome, but with the bailout bill,

140
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,720
which of course is blossomed, I should say, not even bloomed.

141
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,720
But blossomed from a mere 700 billion to it's probably probably a wind up around three or four.

142
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
Maybe even five trillion is what is going to cost us.

143
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,720
This is of course, brings with it inflation.

144
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
And don't take it from me.

145
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Take it from the expert to be hearing from later on on the show.

146
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
All from mainstream media.

147
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Nice little bits aggregated for your convenience.

148
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,720
And of course, we also have our European correspondent here with us.

149
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,720
The tell us how the situation is in the EU.

150
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Comics trip.

151
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Comics trip.

152
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Comics trip.

153
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Comics trip.

154
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Comics trip.

155
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Comics trip.

156
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Comics trip.

157
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Comics trip.

158
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Comics trip.

159
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Come on in, CSB.

160
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
Who are them?

161
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
And you're the carry.

162
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Yes.

163
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,720
So EU, it means European Union is light in darkness.

164
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,720
And become of freedom, a force for good in the world.

165
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:32,720
And new EU directive prescribes that manufacturers of electronic devices should offer.

166
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,720
I quote, readily removable batteries.

167
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
No, I was.

168
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Yes.

169
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Also Apple.

170
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
The iPhone.

171
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
The company.

172
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,720
It's before us to offer extensible batteries in iPhones and iPods.

173
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,720
And otherwise, they can forget about 400 million customers of EU.

174
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Cool.

175
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
You.

176
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,720
Yeah, I heard about this CSB.

177
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
I read about that.

178
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
I think a week ago.

179
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,720
And it was actually was a conclusion that was made.

180
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,720
I saw it first in the Netherlands.

181
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,720
There is a very strict directive on batteries and how disposable they have to be.

182
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,720
So that you need to be able to basically throw a device away without throwing its battery away.

183
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Which indeed does mean that technically the iPhone and the iPod touch could be in violation of European Union law.

184
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,720
But that really doesn't matter too much because particularly when it comes to laws, it looks like the United States of America will be.

185
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,720
You know, I thought that the EU with the Lisbon Treaty and all that that it was going to become the United States of Europe.

186
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,720
But really the United States is becoming the United States of Europe.

187
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,720
We're becoming a complete socialist state.

188
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,720
It's it's crazy.

189
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,720
I'm going to get to some of these comments kind of fast here.

190
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
So we can get back into the music.

191
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,720
This is I might actually have to cut this one off a little bit.

192
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
It's DSC from Oregon, but you make such good points.

193
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,720
I definitely want to give him a voice here for a second.

194
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Yeah, I'm DSC out of Oregon for now.

195
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,720
To call and listen to the daily source code on Saturday.

196
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,720
And I got to say,

197
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,720
I've been right so far.

198
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,720
I think everybody's it's been watching this unfold.

199
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,720
It's been kind of all I don't want to say patting ourselves on the back.

200
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
At least doing I told you.

201
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,720
I'm trying in affirmative response to what we knew was coming.

202
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,720
All these people that are denying it are simply again still still living in the bubble.

203
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
There's still hoping somebody's going to pull it out.

204
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
I got to interrupt you.

205
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Meanwhile, I'm also replacing batteries in the this is the UK pronunciation.

206
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
You've noticed batteries.

207
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
We don't say batteries.

208
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
We say batteries.

209
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Replacing the batteries in the fader Fox here.

210
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Yeah.

211
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Gosh.

212
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
Let me just back that up for one second.

213
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
I lost my train to Thought Hold on.

214
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Again, still still living in the bubble.

215
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,720
There's still hoping somebody's going to pull it out.

216
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
Come on.

217
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Come on.

218
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
No one person can save this.

219
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
Yeah.

220
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,720
This is what's what I've noticed is that the Dow Jones industrial average, the index,

221
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,720
has pretty much become the public bell weather of whether the economy is going well or not well.

222
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
And it's stupid.

223
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
It's like a chart.

224
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Graph, you know, which by the way, is being highly manipulated by the so-called plunge protection team,

225
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,720
the president's working group on financial markets,

226
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,720
Ron Paul keeps calling for transparency on that.

227
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,720
He says it's easier to get information about the CIA and what those guys are doing.

228
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
So a lot of this is manipulation.

229
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,720
But it's said the money's gone.

230
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,720
It's gone and nothing happened and nothing will happen.

231
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,720
You know, what will happen is a lot of people are getting bailed out.

232
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,720
But mainly banks and not small banks, but the big banks, Goldman Sachs,

233
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,720
where, of course, the Treasury Secretary is from.

234
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,720
And also his, his, his little PA, what's his name, Neil Cache Curry,

235
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,720
which, of course, everyone's laughing about.

236
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
I mean, what a perfect name for the guy.

237
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Neil Cache and Kerry, who's been handing out money.

238
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
And of course, we didn't want to.

239
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,720
And you always, we didn't actually want to inject money directly into the bank.

240
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
So no, no, that's un-American.

241
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Now, here we are.

242
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
We're doing it.

243
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
That's what the Europeans are doing.

244
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,720
Everyone's calling now for a new global financial order.

245
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Listen to Gordon Brown.

246
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,720
This links in the show notes a deadly source code dot com.

247
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
That's how you do it.

248
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,720
What you do is you pull together all that you grab all the money.

249
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,720
They're going to, you know, have control of all the banks.

250
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
And of course, we actually have control.

251
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,720
We actually own it, but look at what government has become in the United States.

252
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,720
It literally is what the EU is becoming.

253
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,720
Or has the EU, the EU was a couple of steps ahead.

254
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,720
And from the helicopter view, I have today, you'll see later on in the show

255
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,720
that all these things are taking place simultaneously.

256
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
All nicely coming together.

257
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,720
All these horrible crises with oil and the climate.

258
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
And we're all going to die.

259
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,720
And then the financial markets is going to kill us all.

260
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,720
And actually it will kill a lot of us because we are going into a severe depression,

261
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,720
not a recession, but a depression.

262
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,720
But the lady P and I were in the city today looking at some houses.

263
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,720
She and Christina definitely want to move into the city.

264
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
I'm cool with it.

265
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,720
You know, I only have a couple, a couple of things.

266
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
I want to be able to stand up straight in these London houses.

267
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,720
By the way, that one you can check off the list.

268
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
That's box one tick.

269
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,720
Got to have good broadband pretty much throughout all the burrows,

270
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
the two burrows of London.

271
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,720
You can get massive broadband tick that box.

272
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,720
And we're looking to be kind of the southwest side.

273
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Relatively easy access to an airfield.

274
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
It may even have to be big and hill for me.

275
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,720
I don't know what other choices there are of small airfields.

276
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
I'm probably not going to stay at Fair Oaks.

277
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,720
So tick that box as well.

278
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
But talking to the real estate agent.

279
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,720
By the way, the agents all over our ass.

280
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,720
This is calling every single minute.

281
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,720
You know, their signs all throughout London.

282
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,720
And actually this guy was talking about a couple of his clients.

283
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,720
He was trying to because they couldn't sell their properties.

284
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,720
And they were trying to rent it out.

285
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Like 1500 pounds a week.

286
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
I mean, these are some serious properties.

287
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,720
But in actuality, what house needs to cost?

288
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,720
6,000 pounds a month.

289
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,720
And please, how rages.

290
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,720
But these were the prices in London.

291
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,720
UK where typically people spend six times their average income.

292
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,720
They're yearly income on their house.

293
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,720
In the US, it's only about 4.2, 4.5 times the annual income.

294
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,720
So you should know the credit crisis is hitting much harder here.

295
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,720
And so this guy was actually, I was trying to get these.

296
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
They have a sales on a rental apartment.

297
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,720
So he was trying to get them rented.

298
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,720
And he actually went to get the keys for two of them.

299
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Just this week.

300
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
And they were sold.

301
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
The bank had already repossessed.

302
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
They weren't sold.

303
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
The bank had repossessed them.

304
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Took back the keys.

305
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,720
He has to relocate another client of his.

306
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Who was actually.

307
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Who had rented a property.

308
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
And now that one got repossessed by the bank.

309
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
And the renters get and kicked out.

310
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,720
This of course is what's happening all over the globe.

311
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
This is just the beginning.

312
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
There's so many things going on.

313
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,720
Let's listen in there with DSE for Morgan.

314
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
Oops.

315
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Sorry about that.

316
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,720
No one person can fix this.

317
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
No one person.

318
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Taking off this somewhere is going to have a solution.

319
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
That's going to resolve this.

320
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
Absolutely.

321
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
That's the big.

322
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
The big thought mistake.

323
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,720
I mean, of course, when a new president comes in,

324
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,720
the stock market will probably go nuts.

325
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,720
He ain't a good way.

326
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,720
But now the the only thing that that someone could affect is

327
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Will this be a long drawn out painful 10 years,

328
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,720
which is exactly what is going to happen the way the

329
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Treasury Secretary is taking care of things.

330
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,720
Or do we want to go through a couple of years?

331
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,720
You know, really, and still going to be two to five, I'd say.

332
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
And it really is.

333
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
We're all going to have to take your step back.

334
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
We were all living above our means.

335
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,720
We have to take a step back.

336
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,720
And it'll work out because the housing prices will come down.

337
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
We'll have a little less to spend.

338
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
We'll still be able to get good houses.

339
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,720
But in the meantime, lots of people are going to get fucked.

340
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,720
The or should I just say, food bar.

341
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Now, food bar, Dan.

342
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
We have to crash.

343
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Yeah, people still want to accept that.

344
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
We don't want to sit there and say,

345
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Hold, but I have X amount of this, X amount of that.

346
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,720
I still see on the news that they're still blaming the housing.

347
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Even with the two to three million houses.

348
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
Yeah.

349
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
That have gone bad.

350
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Paying off the mortgage isn't going to fix this.

351
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Is it going to fix problem?

352
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Yeah, it's, uh, you're right, man.

353
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
It's, uh, it's really the derivatives.

354
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,720
And this is what has to unwind.

355
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
It's just just no other way.

356
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
It has to come apart.

357
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,720
There's, uh, it's like probably $600 trillion of derivatives.

358
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
They're trying to figure out.

359
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,720
And again, I know I'm almost not like a broken record,

360
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
but I worked on a trading desk for these guys.

361
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
It's, it was all phony.

362
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,720
In, in, in, in, in the respect that there were actual trades going on,

363
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,720
but it was nothing more than a facts of a promise of something in the future.

364
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
10, 20 years out.

365
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,720
And that was that being valued is actually something valuable.

366
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,720
It was all done completely off the, you know, over, over the counter.

367
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:59,720
So, um, no, um, um, no exchange, no transparency, no reporting.

368
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Of course, that's really where it all went wrong.

369
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,720
And, um, and just creation of money, blatant creation of money.

370
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,720
And it's, it's interesting to see that now that, that it, of course, is too late.

371
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Still with the speed of the internet, people are catching on.

372
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,720
But as you point out, people really just don't want to hear it.

373
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
You know, they, they want the soft landing.

374
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
The mainstream media is telling us, oh, you know,

375
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
how do we make this into a soft landing?

376
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
And we can do this.

377
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
No, it, we're going to, it's crashing.

378
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
It's completely crashing.

379
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
And it's going to hurt.

380
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
And it's going to hurt a lot of people.

381
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
And I believe no exceptions.

382
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
So, we'll get hurt more than others.

383
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
But at the end of the day, no exceptions.

384
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
We're all getting hurt.

385
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,720
So, I, we are only seeing one show.

386
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Uh, one quote unquote news show.

387
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,720
Talk about the default credit spots, which have actually caused all this.

388
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,720
They were actually people were actually betting on it to fail.

389
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
So, they could pay doubt.

390
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
You look at AIG, the insurance company.

391
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Now, why do stocks need insurance?

392
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Well, they don't want to pay for the,

393
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Well, it wasn't the stocks, but it was insurance for,

394
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,720
for basically people defaulting on, um, on the mortgages.

395
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
There you go.

396
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,720
They don't want to pay when they lose.

397
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
Uh, I do have to agree with that.

398
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,720
We're in, uh, oh, everybody's a winner to my mentality.

399
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
Yeah, that's right, man.

400
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
That's another thing.

401
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
You got to have losers.

402
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
And, you know what?

403
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,720
We've been in a horrible job teaching our children that sometimes you just lose.

404
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Sometimes you get full barred.

405
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
It just happens.

406
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,720
And then you got to pick yourself up and get back in the race.

407
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,720
And we have not been teaching our children this.

408
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,720
And these children, many of them went on to run Wall Street.

409
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
No losers.

410
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
Only winners here.

411
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,720
You're only, you only, you were seventh.

412
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,720
You were the number seventh winner.

413
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Johnny.

414
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
Instead of, uh, son, you sucked.

415
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
That's all right.

416
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
We'll get a bit next time.

417
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Practice hard.

418
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
That's what America was made up.

419
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,720
And we've turned into a nation of posses.

420
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,720
And, uh, and so has most of Western Europe.

421
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
Just posses.

422
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
No losers.

423
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
Only winners.

424
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
We've forgotten.

425
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Again, our past are the 1893, 1927, 1929, 1929.

426
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,720
1907, um, 1773, uh, 1980.

427
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
You've been around.

428
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Look at it.

429
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,720
It's, it's all, 1999, 2000 with the bubbles.

430
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Yeah.

431
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,720
We, we, we over and flake.

432
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Everybody that can't take advantage of it.

433
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
Don't us.

434
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
Everybody that can't take advantage of it.

435
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
Try to, try to surface to get him.

436
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
It tries to get him on the ground floor.

437
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Only to realize that.

438
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Oh, it's already too late because they're about four to five years too late.

439
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Absolutely.

440
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
Uh, actually this comment is on the drop.

441
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
Uh, it's another two minutes.

442
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
And it is for our Friday.

443
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
So I do want to get back into the music.

444
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
But I appreciate all the feedback.

445
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
Really got me started there.

446
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,720
Uh, DSA listener from, uh, from Oregon.

447
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,720
And of course, um, although I will be talking about this over the weekend with John C.

448
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,720
Tovorek on No agenda, which will be recording on Sunday, by the way.

449
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
Due to my, uh, travel.

450
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
Uh, so don't expect it Saturday.

451
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,720
Uh, of course, October 14th came and went.

452
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Uh, prophesized by many on the interwebs.

453
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,720
As the day that, uh, an alien ship would surface for three days.

454
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
And as I said, I was very open to this.

455
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,720
I didn't prophesize it, but I was very open to it.

456
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,720
But at the end of the day, I pretty much looked like a dick and I realized it.

457
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,720
So we'll talk more about it on Sunday.

458
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
I do have some thoughts and some theories.

459
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,720
But unfortunately, yeah, I'm just a douche.

460
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
Shouldn't have bought that one, huh?

461
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Open mouth, open smash mouth.

462
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,720
Come on, come on with that in him.

463
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,720
If you've got fun, go tell me about it.

464
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Just stay in my clinic.

465
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
So don't you make, act now.

466
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
So fast and run, and out.

467
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
A lot with your skill, a lot.

468
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
Six two eight years to the right.

469
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
And you can follow me.

470
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,720
Be out to all of all it.

471
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Be out to the shun.

472
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,720
And my eyes will be walking on the sun.

473
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Twenty five years, I'll go.

474
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Thanks, bro.

475
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
Calamate, bro.

476
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Calamate, set shun.

477
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
And I'll press shun.

478
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
And together they took.

479
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
And they pulled down.

480
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
With good toss.

481
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
Oh, round of all, far just.

482
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Sing and make happy men.

483
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
What the hell happened?

484
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
Yes, I'm with the hell.

485
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
So, where help?

486
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
Bells and they fell down.

487
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
So yeah, back up.

488
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
And on, back it's a little too.

489
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
And they came for him.

490
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
They chicked.

491
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
So him, boy.

492
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
Crits.

493
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Because fashion is fashion.

494
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
All too.

495
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Made anything of it.

496
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,720
So don't you make, act now.

497
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
So fast and run, and out.

498
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,720
A lot with your skill, a lot.

499
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
Six two eight years to the right.

500
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
And you can follow me.

501
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Be out to all of all it.

502
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Be out to the shun.

503
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,720
And my eyes will be walking on the sun.

504
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:40,720
And I'll show you when I'm almost there.

505
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Coach, you feel so.

506
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,720
With the tears, because I've been as loud as been ran for.

507
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
The bond is broke.

508
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Got felt you're open for.

509
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
Yes, I'm not close up.

510
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,720
This always I can't be full.

511
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,720
No God, I can't be full.

512
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,720
So don't sit in the back kick.

513
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
I can't watch the world get most wack.

514
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,720
You can't stand your name on it.

515
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
It's on the right side.

516
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,720
And I put away the crap that fall the crack.

517
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
But you will wait.

518
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Your needs are be that way.

519
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
And your baby is older.

520
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Now tell me.

521
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
Hey.

522
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
She don't do it.

523
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Act now.

524
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,720
So fast and run, and out.

525
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
A lot with your skill, a lot.

526
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Six two eight years to the right.

527
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,720
And you can follow me.

528
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,720
Be out to all of all it.

529
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Be out to shun.

530
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
You might as well be well.

531
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
You know the sun.

532
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,720
And you might as well be well.

533
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Be all the sun.

534
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
Yeah.

535
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
And you might as well be well.

536
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Go the sun.

537
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Ah, someone.

538
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
It's not me.

539
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,720
Wow.

540
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Smash mouth.

541
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Might as well be walking on the sun.

542
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,720
And double share Charlie seven nine or nine.

543
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Oh, boy.

544
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Yeah, what a disappointment that was.

545
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,720
Well, anyway, I guess we're just going to have to do it all for ourselves.

546
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
There's no quick fix coming.

547
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
Coming.

548
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,720
The aliens aren't going to save us, which means we'll just have to keep on going with many

549
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,720
daily source code to help you awaken your friends.

550
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
Turn them on to the show.

551
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Hopefully they can.

552
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,720
They can get through it and start to see some light at the end of the tunnel.

553
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
Because we'll come out of this.

554
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
You know, how effectively we come out of it.

555
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
I just wish.

556
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
Yeah.

557
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,720
I just wish I had been able to start years ago and maybe affected more change.

558
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:26,720
And somehow, you know, was able to stop some of this because it's, it's not going

559
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
to be good.

560
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
It really isn't.

561
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,720
I have to say right now, it looks like Barack Obama is going to be the next president

562
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,720
of the United States.

563
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
It seems like a nice guy.

564
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Very charismatic.

565
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Anyone who listens to the DSC knows.

566
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,720
I would definitely not vote for either candidate or any candidate of either of those

567
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
parties.

568
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,720
It would have to be independent because they're run by.

569
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,720
Basically, the shadow government.

570
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
Let's call it that.

571
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,720
Call it the new world order or whatever you want.

572
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
They're being run.

573
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,720
And it's nice to see that finally all over the net.

574
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
It's dawning on people that the.

575
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
The big new Brzinski is indeed.

576
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,720
The brains behind Obama's campaign.

577
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
And there are some things.

578
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,720
And I'm going to leave that for the daily source code for no agenda.

579
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Because John and I will definitely pick it up again.

580
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:22,720
The 95% you know, the tax cut for the 95% of Americans who pay taxes.

581
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,720
The refundable tax cut I mind to I might add, which basically turns America into.

582
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,720
A socialist country like many that I have lived in or actually currently live in.

583
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Where they easily hand out money to people who don't do anything.

584
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,720
That is just not the American way.

585
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
The American way is you stimulate business.

586
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,720
By the way, in America, 75% of all business is small to medium business.

587
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,720
That's everything from the one man store stall.

588
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,720
I should say almost to, you know, a small family store.

589
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,720
To me, you know, and even even bigger than me, view.

590
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
These are small businesses.

591
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,720
We are really what the economy is in the United States.

592
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
And we're getting fucked.

593
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,720
So typically what you do is you help those companies so that they can keep more money.

594
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Higher more people, which is called job creation.

595
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720
Because, wow, man.

596
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,720
We could see eight, nine, ten percent joblessness in the US.

597
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,720
That's a lot of people.

598
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,720
So there are a couple of links I want you to read in the show.

599
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,720
No, it's a daily source code.com.

600
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
One of them is this article.

601
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
It's titled as a big New Jersey.

602
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,720
The real power behind the, and Obama throne.

603
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
Good read.

604
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,720
It'll definitely tell you where the, the Obama policy is headed in the,

605
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Man, the sky looks scary.

606
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Excuse me.

607
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,720
And by the way, four of his sons are also in the campaign or involved with the campaign.

608
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
It's a family.

609
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,720
It's one of the, it's one of, it's a family that's in there and is running the show.

610
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,720
And you can read his books and you'll know exactly what's going to happen.

611
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,720
So as I've stated before, I think that there will, you know,

612
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,720
there will be joyous, joyous feeling in general.

613
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,720
There will be no revolt if Obama wins.

614
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,720
If he loses, I think people will take this streets.

615
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,720
They'll be severely pissed off already.

616
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,720
And again, I don't want to give away too much because John and I are getting some deep info.

617
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,720
There's a lot of worry in the Obama camp as is about a potential recall.

618
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,720
They're already saying no matter how many points he wins,

619
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,720
there's going to be a recall that preparing for it.

620
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,720
They worried about the Supreme Court.

621
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,720
I mean, all kinds of stuff that's going on,

622
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,720
I still believe that the true powers that be the true owners of the earth,

623
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,720
these are the families that are essentially behind the failure,

624
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
this financial failure.

625
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
They do it to grab real assets.

626
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
You know, they have, they have the hands and all these banks.

627
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,720
And so when you lose your house, they get it.

628
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
And they don't care about the house.

629
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,720
They're probably just care about the land or redeveloping entire neighborhoods,

630
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
their bastards, total bastards.

631
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,720
And they've done it before and they'll continue to do it unless we wake up

632
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
and stop it.

633
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,720
But this time, we're going to witness it.

634
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,720
So I'm pretty sure I'm going to be doing the show for at least the next 10 years,

635
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,720
maybe not daily.

636
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,720
But I'll certainly be doing the show.

637
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,720
Excuse me.

638
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Meanwhile,

639
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,720
now I did not see the debate.

640
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,720
That'll be something we'll talk about over the weekend on no agenda,

641
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,720
no agenda at mevio.com.

642
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,720
I basically got a European update upon arrival.

643
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,720
Of course, it took place in the middle of the night.

644
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,720
Excuse me.

645
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,720
It's finally all loosening up that cold,

646
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
that sinus thing I had.

647
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
But now I've just got this cough.

648
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,720
I got to get rid of those kind of gnarly.

649
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,720
Anyway, I'll give you the details of that.

650
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,720
It's all a big show.

651
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,720
And the show continues fantastic YouTube clip,

652
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,720
which I'm going to play a little bit for you right now.

653
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,720
You'll see how well this is done.

654
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,720
Obama is an actor.

655
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,720
And a damn good one.

656
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,720
And you can feed him almost any line.

657
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
And he can deliver.

658
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
If you see this YouTube video,

659
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,720
which is the the Al Smith dinner,

660
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,720
I think it was in New York City.

661
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Obama has his notes.

662
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
And he's looking at points.

663
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,720
He's almost reading them verbatim.

664
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,720
You know, he keeps looking down.

665
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
And even though his timing is kind of funky,

666
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,720
he hammers at home.

667
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,720
But the jokes are just so well written.

668
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,720
This guy has got some major lead people behind him.

669
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
Listen to this.

670
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Thank you to Alan Tam to your Eminence.

671
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,720
To Governor Patterson and Mayor Bloomberg,

672
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,720
to Senator and Mrs. McCain.

673
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
By the way,

674
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,720
this is a white tie dinner.

675
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
So everyone's got white bow ties.

676
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
And McCain is right there.

677
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
And like everyone's there.

678
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Hillary Clinton is there.

679
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,720
This is a big to do.

680
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,720
The Alfred East Smith Memorial Foundation dinner.

681
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
I don't actually know what that's about.

682
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
But it doesn't matter.

683
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,720
Listen to Obama reading his lines and just killing.

684
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
You know, you at the end of the day.

685
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,720
Any any project, any creative project,

686
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,720
like a movie or TV series or a book,

687
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
of course,

688
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
you know,

689
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
it all comes down to the writing.

690
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,720
Which is why these writers straight to strikes are always so debilitating.

691
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
Listen to what these guys wrote for him.

692
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
This is better than Saturday Night Live.

693
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,720
My wonderful colleague, Senator Clinton and Schumer,

694
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,720
to all the distinguished guests.

695
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,720
There is no other crowd in America that I'd rather be

696
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
pounding around with.

697
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Writing.

698
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
All right.

699
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
That was good.

700
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,720
I'm sorry it couldn't be here.

701
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,720
I do send regards to my running mate.

702
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,720
The writing or has Senator McCain noted.

703
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,720
He now actually likes to be called Joe the senator.

704
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
All right.

705
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,720
So first, you know, so he's hammering the cane with these jokes.

706
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
So the first one is, you know,

707
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
of course a reference to paling around with terrorists.

708
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,720
And then Joe the senator versus Joe the plumber.

709
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,720
So that's two for two, I'd say.

710
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,720
And he's just he's reading it right off of his paper.

711
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,720
I was thrilled to get this invitation.

712
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,720
And I feel right at home here because it's often been said

713
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,720
that I share the politics of Alfred East Smith

714
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,720
and the years of Alfred E. Newman.

715
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Oh, good self-deprecating humor.

716
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
Awesome.

717
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,720
Which by the way means he's wide open for ear jokes now.

718
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Come on, man.

719
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,720
We just recycle those Prince Charles jokes.

720
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
Come on.

721
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Get him out.

722
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
Come on.

723
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,720
You liberal media.

724
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
Don't be such chisters.

725
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
Even he's making fun of himself.

726
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
Let's have some fun with this guy already.

727
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Can we?

728
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,720
But I have to say tonight's venue isn't really what I'm used to.

729
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,720
I was originally told we'd be able to move this outdoors to Yankee State.

730
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
That's a double joke, of course.

731
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
Yankee Stadium being demolished.

732
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
The original Yankee Stadium.

733
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Good New York Joe.

734
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,720
Can somebody tell me what happened to the great column?

735
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,720
He's reading it.

736
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
He's just reading the jokes.

737
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
He's reading the punch lines even.

738
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
It's great.

739
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,720
I do love the Waldorf Astoria, though.

740
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
You know, I hear that from the doorstep.

741
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,720
You can see all the way to the Russian TV.

742
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,720
Oh, my goodness.

743
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,720
That's awesome.

744
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,720
That is what I call a show.

745
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,720
It's not going to be here with El Smith.

746
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,720
I obviously never knew your great grandfather,

747
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,720
but from everything that Senator McCain has told me.

748
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
I got to stop.

749
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
You got to see this whole thing.

750
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
It's phenomenal.

751
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,720
And that is some awesome writing.

752
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,720
I mean, you know, Letterman has been hammering McCain.

753
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,720
And of course, McCain was on Letterman the other day.

754
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
I didn't see that, unfortunately.

755
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,720
I saw some quick reviews here and there and it looked like nothing too spectacular.

756
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,720
But this is better than the shit Letterman's coming up with.

757
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,720
Who the hell writes that?

758
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,720
And how can I hire that person to write for the daily source code?

759
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,720
I'd love that, please.

760
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,720
Oh, man, phenomenal.

761
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
phenomenal.

762
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,720
We'll talk a little bit more about Obama and McCain and the financial situation

763
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,720
and their policies coming up.

764
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,720
First, those switching gears to one of the most controversial topics on the Charlie of

765
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
late.

766
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,720
This, of course, is regarding Gardezill, the HPV vaccine.

767
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,720
In some cases being given.

768
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,720
Mended in some places in the world, mandatory.

769
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,720
Also, a mandatory for anyone immigrating into United States.

770
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,720
I would like to point out.

771
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,720
Which, as you know, I believe is extremely dangerous.

772
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,720
It hasn't been tested long enough.

773
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,720
It's brought to you by the same people who brought you viox.

774
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,720
Took that off the market only just a couple of years ago.

775
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,720
Another one of those grand, you know, who cheated and tested out two well schemes.

776
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,720
And it's really not a short deal.

777
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,720
You know, and it's very expensive.

778
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,720
And just look at what these farmer circles are doing.

779
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,720
They're scrambling hand over foot to find anything they can.

780
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,720
Anything to fill up their medicines that, of which the patents are expiring.

781
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,720
Which means they need billions of dollars in their inclusion with, with our government.

782
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,720
Worldwide, our government's to be fast tracked and mandated.

783
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,720
And, you know, price points set enormous amounts.

784
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,720
It's, it's, this is how the, this is really how the lobbyists work.

785
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
They'll say, oh, let's say, get this mandate.

786
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
It's mandatory.

787
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
It's good.

788
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
We've got studies.

789
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
We've got tests.

790
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,720
The PR machine cranks up and man, they're doing overtime.

791
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,720
It doesn't mean that it's all good, though.

792
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Hey, Adam.

793
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
It's Michael Cole and Matt.

794
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,720
Some Chicago again.

795
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Maybe.

796
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,720
First of all, I was one who said you were sometimes crazy like a shit house rat in that

797
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,720
Chris and Seattle.

798
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,720
Yeah, no, no, no.

799
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
I know he was just repeating it.

800
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
But that's okay.

801
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
Because I like it.

802
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,720
Sometimes crazier than a shit house rat.

803
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
But I said sometimes.

804
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,720
And I missed Don Lafantaine.

805
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,720
You'll be perfect saying that in the world.

806
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,720
Where sometimes he's crazier than a shit house rat.

807
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
I miss him.

808
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
And I said, I love you, brother.

809
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,720
I'm a great show.

810
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,720
You're talking about, and have been about Cardis Hill.

811
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,720
And the way they're injecting it into, um, into our children.

812
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,720
And I'm my children.

813
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
But, you know, people's children.

814
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
I agree.

815
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,720
It's pretty shady.

816
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
It hasn't been enough time.

817
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,720
I mean, I think we're probably all someone's child somewhere along the line

818
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Aren't we now?

819
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,720
There's something that the, uh, the drug companies are doing because they're, uh,

820
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,720
losing their patents.

821
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
And there I is.

822
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,720
And they need to come up with the next big thing.

823
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,720
Yep.

824
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,720
Uh, you were talking about, um, uh, using Flood of Might as a comparison,

825
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,720
which was, uh, something done back in the 60s.

826
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
And in Europe.

827
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
And I think it's still done in Brazil.

828
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,720
I don't know.

829
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
Yeah, this was, uh, this was a horrible horrible mistake.

830
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
It really fucked up a lot of babies.

831
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,720
I don't know what the stats are on, um, you know, how often,

832
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,720
or what the results have been.

833
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,720
Uh, but as you said, it produced a lot of birth defects.

834
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,720
And I thought, uh, as I'm Michael from Chicago of Opera Now.

835
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:10,720
Uh, there's a guy, uh, singer, a base baritone in Tomas Quastoff,

836
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,720
who was a German, who was a, you know, a quote unquote,

837
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,720
with a might baby.

838
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,720
Um, he has very small, uh, very, very short legs,

839
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,720
and very, very short arms.

840
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,720
But, you know, like a fully developed torso and head.

841
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,720
And he is a very, very successful singer.

842
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,720
Um, obviously he doesn't do much opera.

843
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,720
Um, uh, although they wanted to hit somebody wanted him to play.

844
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,720
We're going to let out.

845
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,720
Who is supposed to be a dwarf?

846
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,720
Yes.

847
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,720
We're going to let us an upper by very.

848
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
That's fun.

849
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,720
Uh, he, he turned it down.

850
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,720
Yeah.

851
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
I mean, my man's got integrity.

852
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,720
You know what I'm saying?

853
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,720
The operatic dwarf.

854
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,720
Now, be funny, man.

855
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,720
That would be cool.

856
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,720
I'd watch that.

857
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,720
I'd go see that show.

858
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Have a huge voice come out of a small guy.

859
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,720
Or whatever, it doesn't matter.

860
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,720
I love people who are weird.

861
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
No, I'm one of them myself.

862
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,720
I got my own weird shit.

863
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720
And what's normal, by the way.

864
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
Huh?

865
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
What's the norm?

866
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,720
Is that what's on Vogue Magazine?

867
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Is that what's in GQ?

868
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,720
Is that what's supposed to be the norm and how you're supposed to be normal and good?

869
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
That's the beauty of it, man.

870
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,720
We're all messed up.

871
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:16,720
And if we can just stop with the political correctness and just call the spade,

872
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,720
the spade, the spade, call the nutball, the nutball.

873
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,720
And not take such a fence and light knob.

874
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,720
That would be a pretty good start, wouldn't it?

875
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Before they start putting in rules, laws generally accepted across nations,

876
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,720
where you can't say these words.

877
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
Yeah.

878
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
Hey.

879
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
It's all coming.

880
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
If we don't watch it, buddies.

881
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
It's all coming.

882
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Why is we probably?

883
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
But I thought it was interesting.

884
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,720
You know, this guy who came into this world with a, you know, up against the

885
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,720
C.A. Ball and he's been able to be very successful with his life.

886
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Yep.

887
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
And he's a good singer, two good boys.

888
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
And teams are putting in this guy.

889
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
There's a lot of teaching as well.

890
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,720
So, gotten it that way.

891
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,720
Being sting, the chuckle has out there to hear about.

892
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,720
So I take it easy brother.

893
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
All right.

894
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,720
And I'm sorry to think you're getting less crazy like a shit.

895
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
That's right.

896
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
Let me know.

897
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
Don't worry.

898
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,720
That plenty of crazy still left to me.

899
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
I promise you.

900
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
Love you too, man.

901
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,720
I'll just stay on the shots for a second.

902
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,720
This, and all these links, of course, in the show,

903
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,720
know today at resource code.com.

904
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,720
I'll see.

905
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
Scroll up to this.

906
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Yeah, this is happening in New Jersey.

907
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,720
Now, we talked about this a couple weeks ago that New Jersey was mandating all

908
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,720
preschoolers and kindergarteners.

909
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,720
Have to get a, a flu shot in order to attend school.

910
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,720
And parents, thank goodness,

911
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,720
bless all of you are protesting this.

912
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,720
Now, my belief is that, you know,

913
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
the flu is not comfortable.

914
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,720
It does suck,

915
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,720
but it does build up your resistance.

916
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,720
You know, there's no reason with, you know,

917
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,720
the basic over-the-counter medicines we have.

918
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
I really don't see much of a reason.

919
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,720
Not to just let kids get the flu.

920
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
You know, it has to happen.

921
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,720
But this, of course, is all a run up to the avian bird flu.

922
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,720
And, and, and I can feel it in my bones.

923
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,720
They're going to come out when they're ready.

924
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,720
They're just in, whether it will be true or not.

925
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,720
And they're already talking about getting flu shots in preparedness for the avian flu.

926
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,720
Again, it's a combination of,

927
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,720
how, well, I hope that all it is is really just,

928
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,720
um, government complicity in,

929
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,720
in, in helping big pharmaceuticals and make billions of dollars.

930
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,720
I mean, already these companies have this in their pipeline.

931
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,720
You can read it in their corporate annual reports.

932
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,720
They're projecting one to two billion dollars per company,

933
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,720
depending on what virus or vaccine they have.

934
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,720
And then literally saying avian bird flu.

935
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,720
So they're going to, the government's going to scare you into taking these shots.

936
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,720
And I just don't buy it.

937
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,720
You know, where is the damn bird flu?

938
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Oh, oh, it might, it might go from birds to humans.

939
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,720
Well, in 15 years I've been hearing about this thing.

940
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,720
It hasn't really happened yet.

941
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,720
Yeah, 150 cases give me a break worldwide.

942
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,720
So good on these parents because, of course, it should be freedom of choice.

943
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,720
And when it comes to the flu, please.

944
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,720
I mean, polio.

945
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,720
Yeah, these things were, you know, there's no patents on these.

946
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,720
You know, it's a very effective and cost-effective vaccination.

947
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,720
But that was really made before big pharmaceuticals were in there.

948
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,720
And would do anything including kill our children to make a buck.

949
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,720
So I advise you to do your own research,

950
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,720
but I would fight against it.

951
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,720
Of course, a lot of people.

952
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,720
And I think there's, there's some truth in this,

953
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,720
because there's traces of mercury in these shots.

954
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,720
They claim that one and out of every 94 kids gets autism

955
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,720
because of these vaccinations,

956
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,720
genuine McCarthy even.

957
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,720
And we'll see on people magazine that a big stink about it.

958
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
Good on her.

959
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,720
Don't let the government inject shit into your kids.

960
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,720
Not unless you've done so much research

961
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,720
that you really feel confident that this is the right thing.

962
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,720
And I had a conversation with Patricia because she keeps saying,

963
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,720
you know, she's kind of on the fence and I said, you know,

964
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,720
honey, please, don't get the flu shot.

965
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
And she usually does get the flu.

966
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,720
And she's had really bad flu.

967
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
She's had pneumonia twice.

968
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,720
I said, I'm so worried.

969
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,720
I'm really so worried about you getting the shot.

970
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,720
And she said, okay, I won't take it this year.

971
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,720
I said, but the other children should be dropping hands like,

972
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,720
well, I hope it don't get sick.

973
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,720
Yeah, so of course she's going to get sick.

974
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,720
And then, you know, she'll blame me and I said, no, please,

975
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,720
I want you to decide.

976
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,720
You do the research.

977
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,720
Please, don't take it from me.

978
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,720
And if you want to take the shot, it's okay.

979
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,720
Yeah, you're not going to die immediately.

980
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,720
I at least I hope not.

981
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,720
But who the fuck knows?

982
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,720
And you know, maybe you should try and just be strong and

983
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,720
and get through one or two of these flu's.

984
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
So I'll let you know what she decides.

985
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,720
But that, of course, has her totally her personal choice.

986
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
Just how I just worries me.

987
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,720
So anyway, to these parents in New Jersey.

988
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,720
True Americans.

989
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
We've lived up, figured through the King of England.

990
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,720
For the dollar coming from the India.

991
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,720
We call our five, he comes in our hands.

992
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,720
We'll hit for our home.

993
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,720
We'll go next and dedicate it to Neverday.

994
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,720
Just as dirty call and make a book that we didn't know.

995
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,720
It doesn't look that way to me.

996
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,720
They can still got no.

997
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,720
Listen up now, for you who I am.

998
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,720
Just to know the stupid American.

999
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,720
You don't want to make it to one or two.

1000
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,720
You don't want to understand.

1001
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,720
So finish up the drink and go home.

1002
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,720
I can't follow the man up.

1003
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,720
It's like plenty.

1004
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,720
Clean it from where I want with it.

1005
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,720
Oh yes, it's ready.

1006
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,720
And they turn it.

1007
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,720
The country that I love.

1008
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,720
But in the land of Australia.

1009
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,720
And I want to close the land.

1010
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,720
Hey, fucking quiet.

1011
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,720
And I'm a free person.

1012
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,720
Don't let caught these fears in.

1013
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,720
They can joke I know.

1014
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,720
Listen up now, tell your who I am.

1015
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,720
Just to know the stupid American.

1016
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,720
You don't want to make it to one or two.

1017
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,720
You don't want to understand.

1018
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,720
Come finish up the drink and go home.

1019
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,720
I can't follow an essay.

1020
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:36,720
And before the drive, you got to know the people who support you.

1021
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,720
Hey, little guys.

1022
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,720
You've got to know the dude who fought your head.

1023
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,000
Everyone, catch up on the ocean, catch them on the sun

1024
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,280
Break the hell we go

1025
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,840
Listen up, man, I'll tell you who I am

1026
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,280
Just another super, man, I'll make it

1027
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,640
You don't want to let them do what I understand

1028
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,000
So finish up the drink and go

1029
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,280
Listen up, man, I'll tell you who I am

1030
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,680
Just another super, man, I'll make it

1031
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,080
You don't want to let them do what I understand

1032
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,360
So finish up the drink and go home

1033
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,760
Finish up the drink and go home

1034
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,960
Yo, descendants, just another super-American

1035
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,900
It's daily source code, we are at 799 or 9r

1036
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,200
Oh, that'll be 8800 next week

1037
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,200
And not quite sure when I'm going to do it

1038
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,560
Traveling Monday, board meeting Tuesday

1039
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,920
Maybe Tuesday to Wednesday, something like that

1040
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,920
And as I said, going to Los Angeles

1041
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:32,040
But in two weeks time, it probably should be a little easier for me to create

1042
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,360
More shows during the week and also working on a video show

1043
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,840
Ha ha ha

1044
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,840
Yeah

1045
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:43,440
If you're not in the United Kingdom, then you've probably seen

1046
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,120
a mevio.com or cranking up these channels, techs,

1047
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,280
I've been doing some video stuff for that

1048
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,320
We've got the Lux channel up and running

1049
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,640
And I want to do something with something about tech

1050
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,160
But probably really broad base

1051
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,000
And I got some ideas, but that's all in the hopper

1052
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,360
So I'm looking forward to that

1053
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,280
I'm also looking forward to talking to you guys more

1054
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,440
And even another video show that I'm thinking of

1055
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,960
Now that I've got some

1056
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,960
Now hopefully I'll have some time and some capacity in the edit suite

1057
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,560
I want to do it kind of like a daily thing

1058
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,960
Not quite sure when they're calling it yet

1059
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,960
But there's so much video from Seek span

1060
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,960
Maybe just a daily rant that's based around some piece of video

1061
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,960
Something outrageous happening in the world

1062
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,960
I know there's enough material I won't have to search too far

1063
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,960
All I need is Obama's writers and I'd be completely set

1064
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,960
Well, I don't understand you from Seattle

1065
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,960
It was a nice rant you gave on 798

1066
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,960
And pretty exciting episodes

1067
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,960
I was listening to your podcast

1068
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,960
From a couple years ago, which I had caught

1069
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,960
Weed onto a CD and happened to have in my car

1070
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,960
Yeah, do people actually do that?

1071
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,960
You go back and listen to old shows

1072
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,960
Like five night, it's two 300 episodes ago

1073
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,960
That's pretty wild, man

1074
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,960
Thank you

1075
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,960
And listen to the five 90s area there

1076
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,960
And man, your podcast has changed over time

1077
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,960
As I watched you awaken

1078
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,960
I remember you

1079
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,960
In 798, you mentioned that you wish you'd known this when you were younger

1080
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:19,960
Well, I was kind of taught this stuff when I was six back in the early 60s

1081
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,960
That's so cool

1082
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,960
Of course, my entire family was part of the machine

1083
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,960
So that was kept to carefully hidden from me

1084
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,960
But there were enough clues that

1085
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,960
I kind of have some knowledge of what actually happens

1086
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,960
In the true reality of the universe

1087
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,960
A lot of those pieces of the puzzle snapped together for me

1088
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,960
So in a way I've had benefit from it

1089
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,960
And I have watched it happen

1090
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,960
And I've watched every step happen

1091
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,960
And I've tried to wake up people for years

1092
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,960
And years and years and I've been calling it

1093
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,960
And then nothing like you have

1094
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,960
And not to

1095
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,960
And

1096
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,960
Although you see Dr. Ron Paul, right?

1097
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,960
The who even Johnson of War

1098
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,960
I called him a Cooke or Cooke or it doesn't matter

1099
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,960
And now the guys everywhere

1100
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,960
I've even got some bits from one of his recent appearances

1101
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,960
And everyone's like now he's at the authority

1102
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,960
Because of course he predicted this shit

1103
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,960
But 23 years ago is when he predicted it

1104
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,960
It's been heartbreaking

1105
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,960
It's been heartbreaking

1106
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,960
I can't get my own family to follow the stuff

1107
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,960
And listen to it

1108
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,960
It's too hard, listen to

1109
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,960
And that's kind of depressing

1110
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,960
But you are doing something

1111
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,960
It's truly inspirational

1112
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,960
And thank you for having inspired me to make a

1113
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,960
A blog which you're a podcast

1114
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,960
If you like it and you can you can mention

1115
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,960
As your friends, friends, friends and liberty

1116
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,960
Add blogspot.com

1117
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,960
I had some technical problems getting on the pot

1118
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,960
So it's network

1119
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,960
But

1120
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,960
On there as well

1121
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,960
And so I just want to say

1122
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,960
You're doing a great job

1123
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,960
And thank you very much

1124
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,960
It's a hard thing to come to reality with

1125
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,960
For everyone

1126
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,960
And it's been really neat to watch your awakening

1127
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,960
Oh I'm out

1128
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,960
Thank you, Sandy, I appreciate it

1129
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,960
Is that Sandy?

1130
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,960
I think it was Sandy wasn't it?

1131
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,960
Let me just check

1132
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,960
Yeah, Sandy

1133
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,960
A quick interlude here

1134
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,960
I want to remind you about the sponsor

1135
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,960
of the daily source code

1136
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,960
So I'm going to embed this into your mind

1137
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,960
Thinking of taking a trip

1138
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,960
Thinking of driving somewhere

1139
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,960
Budget rental cars

1140
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,960
It's pretty much the way I'm going to be going

1141
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,960
When we're in the city

1142
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,960
Why have a car in the city

1143
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,960
If you need to drive anywhere

1144
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,960
I'm just going to rent one

1145
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,960
And there is a budget

1146
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,960
Right around the corner

1147
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,960
You can book online at budget.com

1148
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,960
If you go to budget.com slash dsc

1149
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,960
You can get up to 30

1150
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,960
Dollars off weekly budget rental cars

1151
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,960
I think they do translated for a Europe

1152
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,960
Or 10% off any amount

1153
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,960

1154
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,960

00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,960
Just scroll down to the bottom of the show notes

1157
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,960
Everything's there

1158
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,960
Of course

1159
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,960
We also have the ongoing go daddy discount

00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,960

Any total package of a domain name

Quick blog, free hosting

1164
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,960
All that stuff

1165
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,960
And one thing that

1166
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,960
I'm sure the economic crisis

1167
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,960
Is not helping

1168
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,960
I personally can see it

1169
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,960
In the people who are using my code

1170
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,960
For Brooks Dome.com

1171
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,960
This is kind of like the

1172
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,960
I call it the sharper image for outdoors

1173
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,960
Man, I got almost zero sales last week

1174
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,960
And you can get 10% off

1175
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,960
Anything you buy

1176
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,960
Just go to the links in the show notes

1177
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,960
A daily source code.com

1178
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,960
Of course there's also e-mmusic

1179
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,960
We got some other stuff on the way

1180
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,960
But the ones I really want you to try

1181
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,960
Check out budget rent of cars

1182
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,960
Because you probably will be renting a car

1183
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,960
One point is pretty easy to remember to use my code

1184
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,960
And of course go daddy at 30% discount

1185
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,960
Over your entire order using dsc

1186
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,960
Number 3, dsc3

1187
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,960
So as Sandy said the show is definitely evolved

1188
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,960
But some things

1189
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,960
They've just got her a main the same

1190
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,960
Certainly when it's a football Friday

1191
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,960
On California casting

1192
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,960
With Adam Curry

1193
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,960
This is the hit test

1194
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,960
Hit it test

1195
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,960
Young pole net

1196
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,960
Adam, this is hit test number 143

1197
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,960
Adam, start right away with intro

1198
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,960
Okay, let's go

1199
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,960
I got to hear that one

1200
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,960
Um

1201
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,960
Okay

1202
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,960
Foo barred up front

1203
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,960
No idea

1204
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,960
Number 2

1205
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,960
Oh, of course

1206
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,960
Dan Hartman rely my fire

1207
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,960
Ah, I must have given you some kind of inspiration

1208
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,960
With Dan Hartman last week, huh?

1209
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,960
Easy one, what's next?

1210
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,960
And number 3

1211
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,960
I think I'm sexy, Rod Stewart

1212
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,960
Okay, I'll say

1213
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,960
I think I got four out of six this time

1214
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,960
I'm very curious to hear what that first one was

1215
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,960
Though that was completely foreign to me

1216
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,960
And it's time for the answers

1217
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,960
And this week they're all from

1218
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,960
Hit it test

1219
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,960
And this is answering number one

1220
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,960
This is Bobby Thornton

1221
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,960
You've got what it takes

1222
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,960
I'm sorry man

1223
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,960
Where was I?

1224
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,960
Never, huh?

1225
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,960
Ah, okay, I remember this

1226
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,960
It's what to me, it's a silly song

1227
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,960
All right, I'll see you on point

1228
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,960
Number 1

1229
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,960
And this is answering number 2

1230
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,960
Um, uh

1231
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,960
This is Dan Hartman

1232
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,960
Relight my fire

1233
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,960
I'll make you sleep everything

1234
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,960
I'm looking to get you

1235
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,960
Reactor

1236
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,960
Relight my fire

1237
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,960
Your love is the only desire

1238
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,960
Relight my fire

1239
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,960
You're the answer number 2

1240
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,960
Dan Hartman

1241
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,960
And this is answering number 3

1242
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,960
Rod Stewart

1243
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,960
Do you think I'm sexy?

1244
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,960
Um

1245
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,960
Tell me so honey

1246
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,960
Just reach out of touch

1247
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,960
Answer number 3

1248
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,960
Rod Stewart

1249
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,960
Do you think I'm sexy?

1250
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,960
And that concludes hit test number 1

1251
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,960
4

1252
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,960
So Adam, how did you do this week?

1253
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,960
Well, I'm not too bad

1254
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,960
I mean the first one I don't I barely remember the song

1255
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,960
But four stars out of a possible six

1256
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,960
I'll take it for a food bar Friday

1257
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,960
I'm pretty happy

1258
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,960
I'll write you that concludes this hit test

1259
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,960
As usual, the place to find the answers to this and any other hit test

00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,960
Yeah, thank you young

1265
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,960
Next week I hope to be back for another hit test

1266
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,960
So until then take care

1267
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,960
Have fun

1268
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,960
And remember to try to think with your heart

1269
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,960
Bye bye

1270
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,960
And be OLDT.com

1271
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,960
Oh man

1272
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,960
It's gonna be another one of those long shows

1273
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,960
It's already a quarter to eleven Friday evening

1274
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,960
So we are rightly food bar

1275
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,960
But there's just so much good stuff I want to share with you

1276
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,960
And let's get into the financial meltdown here for a second

1277
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,960
This is a piece of video I wanted to share with you

1278
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,960
Of course you can find the link at the dailysourcecode.com

1279
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,960
In the show notes

1280
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,960
This is from TheRealNews.com

1281
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,960
Listen to this, you'll like it

1282
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,960
The US economic meltdown has sent shockwaves around the globe

1283
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,960
European markets are no exception

1284
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,960
The real news spoke to author and economist William Engdahl

1285
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,960
About the trouble on Wall Street and the European perspective

1286
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,960
The United States economy is going to go through a hell

1287
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,960
It's begun already

1288
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,960
That's going to be worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s

1289
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,960
Goldman Sachs is Paulson

1290
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,960
By the way, in this video you can see Paulson

1291
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,960
In the Secretary of the Treasury chambers

1292
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,960
You know he's got the American flags and he comes through a door

1293
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,960
Which has like six flags behind it

1294
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,960
It is like he's literally the Wizard of Oz

1295
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,960
Comes from behind the curtain

1296
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,960
This is the man who's doing a lot of evil to us

1297
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,960
The point of Treasury Secretary

1298
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,960
To bail out Wall Street and his colonies

1299
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,960
This is the real colony capitalism

1300
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,960
To bail out his colonies in the financial community

1301
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,960
So with taxpayer money

1302
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,960
After they've loaded the coffers dry in the first place

1303
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,960
With the huge profits on the real estate

1304
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,960
Securization asset pack mortgages and so forth

1305
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,960
This whole multi trillion dollar charades

1306
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,960
Just loans sky eye

1307
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,960
Nobody knows what they're holding in terms of the papers

1308
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,960
It's just as I guess you didn't hear

1309
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,960
This is William Engdahl

1310
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,960
He's an author

1311
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,960
He's well, you can imagine what kind of books he's written

1312
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,960
But he's a political economist

1313
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,960
I think he does know his stuff

1314
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,960
Probably better than I do

1315
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,960
Absolutely madness

1316
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,960
It's been supported by the chairman of the Federal Reserve

1317
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,960
In Greenspan it's supported by Wall Street

1318
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,960
When I can say about the European reaction

1319
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,960
And this is unprecedented

1320
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,960
The German finance minister got up in the parliament ten days ago

1321
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,960
And said this is the end of a Mac

1322
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,960
As the world's financial superpower

1323
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:44,960
We are going to see a whole series of regional financial centers

1324
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,960
Emerge out of this crisis

1325
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,960
There you go

1326
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,960
As predicted

1327
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,960
Regional financial centers

1328
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,960
There'll be regional there'll be like all of North America

1329
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,960
All of Europe all of Asia

1330
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,960
Three will go into maybe two

1331
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,960
But certainly eventually into one

1332
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,960
And they will own all your money

1333
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:03,960
And of course they own your money

1334
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,960
They don't even need to make up the laws

1335
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,960
But they'll they'll take over that as well

1336
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,960
This is the stuff we have to stop

1337
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:10,960
This is the enemy

1338
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,960
And I'm glad we're getting pissed off

1339
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,960
Because it's just the beginning

1340
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,960
Worldwide we're going to have to get extremely pissed off

1341
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,960
At our governments and we're going to have to show it

1342
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,960
And we're going to have to vote them out when we can

1343
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,960
And we have to show our

1344
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,960
Our pain but we're going to have to show it to them

1345
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,960
Because the politicians they don't

1346
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,960
They don't know what's going on

1347
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,960
They're being threatened for entirely different reasons

1348
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,960
They're being threatened with

1349
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,960
Marshall Law

1350
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,960
Stuff like that taking place

1351
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,960
Never again will America maintain that status

1352
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,960
It's the sole financial center of innovation in the world

1353
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,960
They are primarily serious

1354
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,960
I've heard them comment

1355
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,960
Banking events over the recent months

1356
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,960
They're absolutely serious

1357
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,960
At the corruption and fraud

1358
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,960
That's come out of the New York financial community

1359
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,960
Selling as as AAA rated

1360
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,960
Securities to European banks

1361
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,960
Something that is now properly named

1362
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,960
Toxic waste

1363
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,960
Yeah

1364
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,960
Of course that of course is totally true

1365
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,960
But you know the European banks

1366
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:12,960
As much a part of it

1367
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,960
It's not like a US thing

1368
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,960
Not just a US thing

1369
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,960
Everyone was partying

1370
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,960
And the blame you know we have

1371
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,960
People blaming

1372
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,960
Regulation

1373
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,960
The regulators so that's where the Fed comes in

1374
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,960
They have people blaming

1375
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,960
Poor people

1376
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,960
I love that

1377
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,960
Poor people did it

1378
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,960
We have people living beyond their means

1379
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,960
We have 29 year olds driving

1380
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,960
Mazaradis

1381
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,960
It was all there

1382
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,960
The true fault is the system

1383
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,960
The system of central banking

1384
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,960
Where private bankers

1385
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,960
Control your money

1386
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,960
And my money all of our money

1387
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,960
With complete go ahead from the government

1388
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,960
That is the problem

1389
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,960
No one really brings that up

1390
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,960
And we'll just have to keep hammering away at it

1391
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:02,960
Because you know

1392
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,960
And there are some proposals

1393
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,960
Now in the United States

1394
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,960
Dr. Ron Paul has put a couple in

1395
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,960
Audit the Federal Reserve

1396
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:15,960
Of course it's one step onto abolishing the Federal Reserve

1397
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,960
It may take a while but I think eventually

1398
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:18,960
We're going to get there

1399
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,960
But I've realized it is going to be a five to ten year plan for sure

1400
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:22,960
So they regard

1401
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,960
The American financial system is not worth

1402
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,960
To be trusted to

1403
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,960
Walk you dog across the streets

1404
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:29,960
There you go

1405
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,960
Go watch that entire interview

1406
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,960
Link in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

1407
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,960
And regardless of who wins our election in the United States

1408
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,960
It'll just be more of the same

1409
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,960
They're their liars

1410
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,960
They will lie about anything

1411
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,960
And I think McCain lies

1412
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,960
But his lies are Obama lies better

1413
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:52,960
I gotta tell you

1414
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,960
He does make you feel good

1415
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,960
But they're literally liars

1416
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,960
You know and we could catch them on so many different things

1417
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,960
I saw saw I was reading something about Joe Biden

1418
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,960
Remember he was talking about that restaurant that he went to in Scranton

1419
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,960
Turns out that restaurant has been closed for five or six years

1420
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:15,960
I would have been funny if Sarah Palin had that knowledge

1421
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,960
You could have really nailed them on that one

1422
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:22,960
But of course the cutest actor of the bunch is actually Sarah Palin

1423
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,960
But I think in all it'll probably be more interesting to have Obama's president

1424
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:31,960
And I'll be pointing it out along the way every single step of everything that happens

1425
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,960
Including the massive buildup of what we're going to be doing in Afghanistan

1426
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,960
All to run drugs into our own countries and communities

1427
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,960
That's where we'll continue to wage war against the mythical Taliban

1428
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,960
Or the mythical of the Taliban is real the mythical al-Qaeda

1429
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,960
And it's just liars

1430
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,960
And you can pat it away as much as you want

1431
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,960
And we all really want change and hope and something different

1432
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,960
And that's good now I want it to and maybe if we feel better it'll change a little bit

1433
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,960
But at the end of the day we'll just get more of the same probably five times harder

1434
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,960
Hey Adam it's Dave from California

1435
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,960
I did so I wasn't sure and I know you're mentioning that

1436
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,960
Ron Paul was voting was up that king

1437
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,960
Chuck Goldman

1438
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:18,960
Yeah

1439
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:19,960
So I have a question

1440
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,960
And now I'm looking at the constitutionalist party website

1441
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,960
And I was looking at the issues and the points that they bring up

1442
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,960
And then I went to Chuck Baldwin's website

1443
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,960
And I was looking at his issues and who supports him and who likes him

1444
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,960
And all the things that he's back at

1445
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,960
I thought one major discrepancy that always concerns me

1446
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,960
All right now I'm a gay man

1447
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,960
And I'm shocked

1448
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:42,960
Oh no

1449
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:43,960
It's a gay man

1450
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,960
He's calling in the show

1451
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:46,960
I'm shocked

1452
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,960
A lot of people and I'm pretty shocked

1453
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,960
Because everybody's against this whole gay man

1454
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,960
It seems like everybody's against gay marriage

1455
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,960
Now I'm a constitutionalist site

1456
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,960
They say that they find it unconstitutional

1457
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,960
To regulate marriage in any way shape of form

1458
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:04,960
Yeah

1459
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,960
I got a Chuck Baldwin site and he's very pro-traditional marriage

1460
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,960
Now I've never looked at a lot of other issues

1461
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,960
I've really researched

1462
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,960
Much aushes

1463
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:16,960
What is attacking is

1464
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,960
That's just the first one

1465
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,960
I look at because that's the most important to me

1466
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:20,960
Yeah

1467
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:21,960
I want to get your opinion

1468
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,960
What do you say?

1469
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,960
I mean, should this

1470
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,960
How far off from his

1471
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,960
From the other point that he's going to be

1472
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,960
If this one is so drastic we different

1473
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,960
You know, I want to know your points on the whole situation

1474
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,960
As well, I think that would be interesting to find out

1475
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,960
And what you think of him taking a stance

1476
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,960
That basically goes against everything that is part of stanceful

1477
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:42,960
No, not true

1478
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,960
So that's all I want to know

1479
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,960
All right so

1480
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:45,960
Okay

1481
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:47,960
That's a very interesting question

1482
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:48,960
I'm glad you bring that up

1483
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,960
So first of all, when it comes to the constitution party

1484
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,960
And also Dr. Ron Paul, it's really easy

1485
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,960
They have a pamphlet which you can pick up

1486
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,960
At any library, probably any bookstore

1487
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,960
You can find that all over the internet

1488
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,960
It's not even that big

1489
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,960
It's called the constitution of the United States

1490
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,960
And those guys pretty much stick to it

1491
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,960
And it took me a while to get over a couple of things

1492
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,960
The way Ron Paul, for instance, spoke about abortion

1493
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,960
So

1494
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,960
As I believe

1495
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,960
Certainly Ron Paul and

1496
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,960
99% sure the constitution party

1497
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,960
Believe that there should be a separation between church and state

1498
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,960
And that the government

1499
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,960
Nor lawyers or Supreme Court or whatever

1500
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,960
Should decide

1501
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,960
Anything about marriage in any religion

1502
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:42,960
Whatever

1503
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,960
So that first and foremost

1504
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,960
So that's what those guys will tell you

1505
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,960
And I believe them

1506
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:51,960
They mean it

1507
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,960
So if your church wants to have you married a goat

1508
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,960
Or allow you to marry a goat

1509
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,960
Or a woman or a man or whatever

1510
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,960
That should be you and your church's business

1511
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,960
And between you and your church and your God

1512
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,960
And that's what Ron Paul will say

1513
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,960
That's what Chuck Baldwin will say

1514
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,960
That's what the constitution party will say

1515
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,960
Now that they personally

1516
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,960
And Ron Paul is very good at separating this

1517
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,960
That they personally

1518
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,960
Have different views about what should happen in the church

1519
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,960
It's a separate matter

1520
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:29,960
And I believe that every so

1521
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,960
Let me just get to the abortion part

1522
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,960
Because that's where it kind of fuck with my head

1523
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,960
So Ron Paul says, look

1524
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,960
Killing people should be illegal

1525
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,960
But abortion you should be

1526
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,960
It's your body you should you know

1527
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,960
It's up to you what you do with your body

1528
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,960
So then it only comes down to a matter of

1529
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,960
Is an embryo

1530
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,960
Is that a person is is it life at

1531
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,960
At conception

1532
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,960
And that I believe

1533
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,960
Is something that is really kind of

1534
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,960
Still undecided

1535
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,960
So what Ron Paul is saying

1536
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,960
And it's it's still hard to wrap

1537
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,960
My head around he says, look

1538
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,960
I'm against abortion

1539
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,960
Because I'm against killing

1540
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,960
And if you kill someone then you should go to jail

1541
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,960
And really what he comes on the saying

1542
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,960
Is you know if it were my American

1543
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,960
He says the way it would happen

1544
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,960
Is of course abortions would take place

1545
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,960
But the person who performs the abortion

1546
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,960
Would probably be at risk

1547
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,960
I'm not saying it's an ideal solution

1548
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,960
Okay, I'm just saying that he's not lying

1549
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,960
And he says, look I think marriage

1550
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:36,960
Should be a man and a woman

1551
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:37,960
That's up to him

1552
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,960
God bless him I don't care

1553
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,960
And I really don't care

1554
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:42,960
You can marry whatever you want

1555
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,960
I'm happy

1556
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,960
In fact I think gay people should definitely

1557
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,960
Be able to marry each other

1558
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:48,960
It's crazy they shouldn't

1559
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,960
And I wanted to have all the joys of marriage

1560
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,960
I want you to have kids

1561
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,960
You know I want to have all the responsibility of kids

1562
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,960
I want it be easy for you to

1563
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,960
To adopt or conceive with the surrogates

1564
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,960
Please I want you to have the joy of kids

1565
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:03,960
To my pain a little too

1566
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,960
And I want you to enjoy the joys of divorce

1567
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,960
All of it all of it

1568
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,960
And the love in front of you

1569
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:10,960
Your church and your God

1570
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,960
It should absolutely

1571
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,960
We all should be equal in that right

1572
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:14,960
But you know whatever club you belong to

1573
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,960
Which are their rules

1574
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,960
Now

1575
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,960
Obama, McCain, Palin and Biden

1576
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:22,960
And of course we both heard Obama

1577
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,960
Sorry, Palin and Biden say quite specifically

1578
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,960
No, they're both against gay marriage

1579
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:28,960
Against it

1580
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,960
And you know why they're doing that

1581
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,960
Because even if they don't believe it

1582
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:33,960
They're lying

1583
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:34,960
They will lie to you

1584
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,960
Stone face

1585
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,960
Because they know they need the religious

1586
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,960
The religious voters is very important

1587
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,960
So these guys

1588
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,960
And I don't know if Obama has cited it or not

1589
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,960
And believe me

1590
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,960
I'm looking at Obama and there's lots of stories out there

1591
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,960
You know he may be bisexual

1592
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,960
Why wouldn't if he had some experimentation

1593
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,960
No one's ever asked him

1594
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,960
But you know and so what

1595
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,960
Good looking guy

1596
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:00,960
Fine

1597
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,960
You know but he'll never say that he agrees with gay marriage

1598
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,960
Because he has to lie

1599
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,960
He has to lie to get the religious vote

1600
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,960
So that shows you right up front

1601
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,960
These guys will lie in your face

1602
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,960
Stone cold

1603
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:15,960
And you think because you think

1604
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,960
Well they get points if he said hey man

1605
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,960
I think gay marriage should be fine

1606
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,960
Can I say that

1607
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,960
Never

1608
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,960
Because they know it'll blow their chances

1609
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,960
Entirely because the religious vote is huge

1610
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,960
You get it?

1611
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,960
These guys are just fucking liars

1612
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,960
And they're good at it

1613
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,960
So I don't think it goes against

1614
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,960
The constitution party

1615
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,960
Doesn't go against the constitution

1616
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,960
As long as

1617
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,960
The government and the courts are not allowed to decide

1618
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,960
Who marries who for what reason

1619
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,960
It's a private matter between you

1620
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:54,960
Your church and your God

1621
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:55,960
End of

1622
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,960
And I'm pretty sure that's what they're saying

1623
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,960
When they

1624
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,960
Well what they're saying in their materials

1625
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,960
Let's see another YouTube video

1626
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,960
This is Dr. Ron Paul

1627
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,960
I think this was on was this on CNN

1628
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,960
Drone is now from clue text as Republican congressman

1629
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,960
And former presidential candidate Ron Paul

1630
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:16,960
Thanks for joining us this morning

1631
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,960
Now I want you to listen to what he's saying

1632
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,960
I mean I can almost

1633
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,960
I can almost say it before he does

1634
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,960
But he's so good at it

1635
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,960
And so now the guy is mainstream

1636
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,960
I'm blessed him

1637
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,960
He's 70 years old he's out there every single day

1638
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,960
He's doing this is tiring shit man

1639
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,960
He's all over the place he's doing these interviews

1640
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,960
He's getting the word out and he's being taken seriously

1641
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,960
Finally

1642
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,960
Remember to keep promoting this guy

1643
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,960
He's a United States congressman

1644
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,960
He's been doing it for over a decade

1645
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,960
More than that I think

1646
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,960
God I don't know how long he's been doing it

1647
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,960
He voted against the bailout bill

1648
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,960
Our two main candidates who of course are two sides of the same coin

1649
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,960
McKenna Obama voted for the bailout bill

1650
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,960
Because their shields for Wall Street and liars as we just established

1651
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,960
Congressman great to see you

1652
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:02,960
Thank you

1653
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,960
Last time you were with us you explained why you were against the government's bailout plan

1654
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,960
While you were voting against it and you didn't believe that focusing on

1655
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,960
Buying these troubled assets was the smart thing you do

1656
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,960
No sense then they've sort of tweaked it if you will

1657
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,960
And now have decided to buy stakes in some US banks

1658
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,960
I think that's a better strategy to help heal the economy

1659
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,960
Now they tweaked it up

1660
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,960
You know it started off as a three-page document

1661
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,960
It ended up 450 pages

1662
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,960
Instead of 700 billion it's up to $150 billion

1663
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,960
Rorders had a story out this morning

1664
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,960
Today they estimated it's going to cost the American taxpayer

1665
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:37,960
About five trillion dollars

1666
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,960
There you go. Just telling you that number was night

1667
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,960
And that's from Reuters five trillion dollars

1668
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:43,960
That's what it will probably take

1669
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,960
So now it's tweaking in the wrong direction

1670
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,960
And I don't think it's going to do any good whatsoever

1671
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,960
Well the credit markets are starting to loosen up a bit

1672
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,960
At least from what we've seen this week

1673
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,960
Is that a sign that maybe it is working?

1674
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,960
Remember this what we were talking about this

1675
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,960
So the numbers on the big board on CNBC are going up

1676
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,960
Does that mean it's working? Is it all fixed?

1677
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,960
Are we going to be saved? Are we going to have a soft landing?

1678
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,960
Huh huh huh huh Ron tell us

1679
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:08,960
We're going to have a soft landing

1680
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,960
Well maybe to some degree on the short run

1681
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,960
But that just means that

1682
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,960
We'll have more inflation

1683
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,960
You can't create five trillion dollars on a thin air

1684
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,960
And not expect inflation

1685
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,960
So although the dollar may be up a little bit right now

1686
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,960
Because the markets are a little calmer

1687
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,960
This just means that in time

1688
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,960
We're going to all suffer and pay for this

1689
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,960
And we're going to pay for it with higher prices

1690
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,960
And this is the serious problem

1691
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,960
It's the attack on the dollar system

1692
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,960
They're trying to save the dollar

1693
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,960
But this system that we've had since 1971

1694
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:42,960
It's coming to an end

1695
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,960
That's what this whole story is about

1696
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,960
The end of a monetary system that we've had since 1971

1697
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,960
And something has to give

1698
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,960
You just can't create more money on a thin air

1699
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,960
And popping up everybody

1700
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,960
It's an immoral system

1701
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,960
You're asking the poor people to bail out the rich

1702
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,960
You're asking the innocent people to bail out the guilty

1703
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,960
You're asking people to just totally defy the constitution

1704
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,960
Because there's no place in the constitution

1705
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,960
It says that we can do these things

1706
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:09,960
That's right

1707
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,960
There's no place in the constitution of these United States

1708
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,960
Which is a republic

1709
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,960
No place does it say

1710
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,960
That you can regulate the money

1711
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,960
Certainly not

1712
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,960
A bunch of private banks

1713
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:24,960
It's economically

1714
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:25,960
It's a disaster

1715
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,960
This is going to cause a great deal harm

1716
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,960
Even it's like a drug addict

1717
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:30,960
Taking a strong fix

1718
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,960
He feels better for a day or two

1719
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,960
But believe me

1720
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:34,960
We're going to kill the patient

1721
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,960
And the patient here is the dollar system

1722
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,960
And our entire world economy

1723
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:39,960
Have you heard anything?

1724
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,960
I would say let's get off this addiction

1725
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,960
And congressman have you heard anything from either the presidential candidate

1726
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,960
About their economic plans that you think are good things that need to be implemented

1727
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,960
Now this was kind of interesting when I was listening to this

1728
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,960
Because he does actually and surprisingly

1729
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,960
So he does give a McCain some props

1730
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:57,960
Even though of course it's his own party

1731
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,960
But he'll just credit McCain right along with Obama

1732
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,960
Let me just see if he says what I think is going to say about Obama here

1733
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,960
No, not really

1734
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,960
But it's tough to find out the good parts

1735
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,960
I did think that John McCain has a better approach

1736
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,960
To the medical problem

1737
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,960
And Obama has a better approach

1738
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,960
Trying to save some money by coming home from Iraq

1739
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,960
We're spending ten billion dollars a month over there

1740
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,960
So we could save a lot of money

1741
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,960
That money should be spent back here

1742
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,960
But quite frankly, how can we trust anybody

1743
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,960
Because when it comes to the bailout

1744
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,960
How do they differ?

1745
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,960
Was McCain and Obama comes rushing back to Washington and vote for the bailout

1746
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,960
Are they both in the public in it?

1747
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,960
And in a proof both houses I know you voted

1748
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,960
She interrupted her she interrupted him

1749
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,960
That's right because he was saying some really beautiful there

1750
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,960
Yeah, they ran back to Washington to make sure they cast their vote

1751
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,960
To bail everybody out because their overlords their masters told them to do so

1752
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,960
Tens of millions of dollars donated by Wall Street firms to both candidates

1753
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,960
At least the candidates that are allowed to debate on television

1754
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,960
Not truly all candidates

1755
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,960
Since there are at least four independents who are worth looking at

1756
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,960
Against it, but that leads me to another question

1757
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,960
If Barack Obama does end up winning, it looks like the Democrats would really have a

1758
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,960
Trifecta in Congress both houses and the White House

1759
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,960
What does that mean for the American people

1760
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,960
And also for the GOP?

1761
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,960
Let me answer that in my way

1762
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:30,960
Imagine that if the Democratic Party had the House, the Senate, and the presidency

1763
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,960
Oh man, the big new Brazinski you'd be having a field day

1764
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:37,960
We're going to turn into we'll be more socialist and communist than Russia ever was

1765
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,960
Well, I mean it is a disaster for the country and everybody

1766
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:44,960
Because even with all the shortcomings of John McCain

1767
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:49,960
His strong argument to be present is keep the Congress and the presidency and separate hands

1768
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,960
The American people are going to be a lot better off if they're fighting a little bit

1769
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,960
Instead of just having no restraints whatsoever

1770
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:57,960
And that's interesting

1771
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,960
Now are you for the case?

1772
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,960
So we're arguing for him McCain, but I know what you're saying

1773
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,960
Staff members actually writing on your own websites

1774
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,960
Either the Democratic takeover of both houses of Congress and the White House

1775
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,960
This November would be a quote, reputation of false conservatism

1776
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,960
Of the Republican Party

1777
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,960
How do you get back to some of those fiscally conservative ideals?

1778
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,960
Well, it's going to be tough because you have to convince the American people

1779
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,960
That's what we need

1780
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,960
And everybody now

1781
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,960
I'm doing my best man every single day

1782
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,960
We're going to try and convince the American people

1783
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,960
That we need to stop this idiocy, this lunacy

1784
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,960
We've got to stop this central banking crap

1785
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,960
I was realizing the country is something seriously wrong

1786
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:38,960
With our whole financial system and our governmental system

1787
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,960
But the big question is

1788
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,960
Dude, does the majority of the American people believe

1789
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,960
The government can still take care of us

1790
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,960
Or should we get the government out of the way

1791
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,960
Quit spending money, balance the budget, bring our troops home

1792
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:50,960
Yes

1793
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,960
In Latin American people keep the money they earn

1794
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,960
That means drastically reducing taxes

1795
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,960
Getting the government out of this over regulation

1796
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,960
And give up on this idea that inflation solves everybody problem

1797
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,960
Let's roll up our sleeves and get to work

1798
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:06,960
And by the way, Europe, you can do the exact same thing

1799
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,960
Let's get to work, let's try and create some shit here

1800
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,960
Let's try and get some going, let's work

1801
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,960
Let's not sit around to our government, please help me

1802
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,960
And want you to help me with everything

1803
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,960
This is what you do when you create this kind of nanny state

1804
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,960
And that's exactly what's happening

1805
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,960
But it's going to be nannyed on their terms

1806
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,960
Not on yours or mine

1807
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,960
Inflation, that is the creation of new money

1808
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,960
Could solve everybody's problem

1809
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,960
Which they're claiming right now

1810
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,960
Nobody would ever have to work again

1811
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,960
If five trillion dollars could save this economy

1812
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:38,960
Why work?

1813
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,960
Just put money and everybody will be happy

1814
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:41,960
So they don't understand

1815
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:42,960
They don't understand

1816
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:43,960
That's exactly the plan

1817
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,960
That's the Obama plan

1818
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,960
And that's mainly McCain's plan too

1819
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,960
Print money, make everybody happy

1820
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,960
Why work?

1821
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,960
Dude, and do debts

1822
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:00,960
And other transgender people's of earth

1823
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,960
I've seen this happen

1824
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,960
I've seen countries that give away money

1825
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:05,960
Oh, you got another kid

1826
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,960
Well, here's another couple grand a year to take care of your kid

1827
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,960
Which, of course, makes people have more kids

1828
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:15,960
Come to our country

1829
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,960
Come hang out with us

1830
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,960
We'll give you a free money money on the streets

1831
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,960
Yeah, you used to be money on the streets

1832
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,960
If you're worked for it

1833
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,960
Now what do we do?

1834
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,960
This is insulting, it's so insulting

1835
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,960
Damn the idea that people have to work

1836
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,960
People have to save instead of consumer spending more money

1837
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,960
The market is saying you should back off

1838
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,960
Spend less money and save money

1839
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,960
But anyways, oh no, don't save money

1840
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,960
You're supposed to go out there and spend money

1841
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,960
People who have saved the last five years

1842
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:43,960
Have money in the bank

1843
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,960
And cash is good right now

1844
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:46,960
They're going to buy up the bargain

1845
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:47,960
They're going to get a good deal in the house

1846
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:48,960
This is so beautiful

1847
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,960
This is being, this is really

1848
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,960
Dron Paul encapsulates the slavery right here

1849
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,960
Certainly for the American economy

1850
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,960
We're slaves, we're buying machines

1851
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,960
We're supposed to go buy more, buy more

1852
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,960
911, what does the president say?

1853
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:02,960
Go out, shop and go buy more

1854
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,960
The economy has to move by buying more

1855
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,960
Nothing, work your ass off

1856
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,960
Save some money, buy something nice

1857
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,960
A nice house, an affordable house

1858
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:11,960
No, buy more

1859
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,960
We'll feed you with credit

1860
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:15,960
It just ran out

1861
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,960
It's obvious that that system ends

1862
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:18,960
And when it ends then

1863
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,960
You just got to print up more money to make it work

1864
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,960
And that's when it really really ends

1865
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:23,960
That's what Ron Paul is saying here

1866
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,960
The prices of houses should come down

1867
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:28,960
We shouldn't argue if I'm artificially high

1868
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,960
We shouldn't try to stimulate housing

1869
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:31,960
There are too many houses

1870
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,960
We should let the market make these decisions

1871
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,960
It's arrogant for the politicians

1872
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,960
And the bureaucrats, the belief

1873
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,960
They can plan the economy and sort this all out

1874
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,960
We've been doing it for all these years

1875
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:44,960
And the monetary system is so confusing and so corrupt

1876
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,960
The sooner we get back to believing in ourselves

1877
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,960
Believing in freedom, believing in sound money

1878
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:50,960
Believing in the constitution

1879
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,960
We're going to solve these problems

1880
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,960
But right now there's a fight going on in this country

1881
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,960
Our numbers are growing

1882
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,960
Yes, the majority, but our numbers are growing

1883
01:17:58,960 --> 01:17:59,960
Yes

1884
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,960
And as this situation deteriorates

1885
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,960
More people are going to say hey

1886
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:04,960
Maybe it's right

1887
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,960
Maybe limited government and freedom works

1888
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,960
Maybe freedom is popular

1889
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,960
And maybe freedom really works

1890
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,960
And this idea that we have to depend on government

1891
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,960
For all these programs is an illusion

1892
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:16,960
We're not going to leave it there

1893
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:17,960
Excellent

1894
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:21,960
So sometimes the wage jokes are really funny

1895
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,960
And we're hammering McCain on how old he is

1896
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:25,960
And that's a ha ha really funny

1897
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,960
We're nice and ages which is no better

1898
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,960
Or worse than being sexist or racist in my book

1899
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,960
We're all going to get old eventually

1900
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,960
So here's a guy who's 70 years old

1901
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,960
You can learn something from someone like this

1902
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,960
You can learn something from old people

1903
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,960
And when are you old?

1904
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,960
Is 44 constitute old?

1905
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:45,960
I used to in my book

1906
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,960
I've changed that tune

1907
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,960
And yeah, Rompall 70 is old

1908
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,960
Sounds pretty fucking switched on to me

1909
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,960
Here's another old guy who knows what's going on

1910
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,960
And he has some wise and happy words for you

1911
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,960
I know it's going on here

1912
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,960
Ain't no great mystery

1913
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,960
Y'all love faith in yourselves

1914
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,960
Is clear as it can be

1915
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,960
You can wear all you want

1916
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,960
Drining your misery

1917
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,960
But you can listen to me

1918
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,960
Listen to me

1919
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,960
Never have it

1920
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,960
Hope you ever wear a front

1921
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:25,960
Don't let the bastard drive you down

1922
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,960
Never have it

1923
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,960
But they need you

1924
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,960
Even your brain

1925
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,960
And your dreams will come true

1926
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,960
Feel free red sunshine

1927
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,960
The sky's so beautiful

1928
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,960
Like the same dream

1929
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,960
You will sound like a devil

1930
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,960
Me and you

1931
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,960
Listen to me

1932
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,960
Listen to me

1933
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,960
Listen to me

1934
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,960
Listen to me

1935
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:24,360
I'll be

1936
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:31,360
It's you don't take everything

1937
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,360
Come and let my daddy lie on the table

1938
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,360
Why can't I hold him for no more

1939
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:45,360
Won't see you back in holding him

1940
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,360
Why can't I hold him back in all more

1941
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,360
Let him stand there for a bit

1942
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,360
Don't you have a way up front

1943
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,360
What a delay

1944
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,360
No no no no

1945
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,360
Thought that was over

1946
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,360
Oh we ran into my last happy

1947
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,360
From his brand new album

1948
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,360
It's important that I want to the late night shows

1949
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,360
Well I was in San Francisco

1950
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,360
And thought, ah yeah, it's pretty cool

1951
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,360
Actually bought the whole CD

1952
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:17,360
or the whole album

1953
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,360
On iTunes

1954
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,360
A couple of good tracks there

1955
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,360
Lath M Be happy

1956
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:27,360
little message. And you know what? We might as well laugh and be happy because we're all in together. We're all getting fucked at food barred.

1957
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:33,360
News from around the world, things that that happened that didn't get a chance to talk about.

1958
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:43,360
First of all, I'm sure you heard about, or you know, your hider, your hider, the extreme right politician right wing politician from Austria,

1959
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:49,360
who a lot of people equated to a frightening Nazi type dude.

1960
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:57,360
Honestly, when all of when he was really really riding high and a lot of people were talking about him,

1961
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:03,360
I wasn't paying that much attention. And so I totally, you know, I certainly had face values like,

1962
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:07,360
I had the guys in Nazi, whatever. You know, coming from Austria doesn't help.

1963
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:13,360
But of course, I never actually looked into what he was saying. And in many cases, you'll find that someone who might be saying something

1964
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:17,360
really pretty smart and decent, his words can get turned around again.

1965
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:23,360
I don't even have the time to do the research into what he was actually saying a couple of years ago.

1966
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,360
And it's kind of a mood point because he's dead.

1967
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:31,360
A horrific car accident. Now, what's interesting about this story is it comes on the heels of

1968
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:37,360
him at saying in a television debate. And you can Google this. There's, and also there's links in the show notes,

1969
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:43,360
maybe source code.com, and it crossposts that at curie.com. He was essentially, in the debate he was saying,

1970
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:49,360
Hey, you know, this banking mafia, it is a mafia. We've got to bring these guys down because they're really,

1971
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:54,360
they're screwing us. You know, kind of like when I was saying, except this guy's a politician.

1972
01:22:54,360 --> 01:23:00,360
And he's, and when he says something, it's big news. Well, very suspicious circumstances,

1973
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:08,360
regarding his death in this solo automobile accident, particularly the picture is a rather peculiar

1974
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:14,360
hole in the on the driver side on the roof. You can see that picture in the show notes.

1975
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:18,360
And you could be a number of things, but I don't even have to, I don't even have to see the

1976
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:24,360
hole or any weird pictures to know that this sounds like a hit, particularly, you know,

1977
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:28,360
37 hours after he basically said, we got to bring these banking mafia down.

1978
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:34,360
He called on the mob. He says, organized crime taking place before our very eyes.

1979
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:41,360
So let's hope I never get into politics because that looks like ultimately you suicide yourself.

1980
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:46,360
Or you get suicide. That's what happens. Now let's take a look at the Australians.

1981
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:52,360
This is something that's happening in the United Kingdom, and it will happen worldwide.

1982
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:59,360
We're talking about filtering initiatives. The Australian government looks like the Australian

1983
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:05,360
cyber safety plan, which aims to block, quote, illegal content from being accessed within the country,

1984
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:12,360
as well as pornographic material inappropriate for children. Interesting.

1985
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:18,360
So there goes my porn. If it's inappropriate for children, then it's not appropriate for me.

1986
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:22,360
If I'm an Australia, if I'm an Australia, if I'm down under, yeah, Australians, by the way,

1987
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:26,360
horny bunch of people, they like getting it on, getting it leg up.

1988
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:30,360
They like a little bit of porn. Maybe a lot of porn.

1989
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:34,360
Hey, is there any Aussie porn? Could someone please send me a link?

1990
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:39,360
I'd be kind of hot. Oh, yeah. I'll just think it.

1991
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,360
What that sounds like.

1992
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:46,360
Hmm. Come to think of it. I've never really seen porn from down under.

1993
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:52,360
Okay. Chuckle heads down under. Looking forward to your submissions.

1994
01:24:52,360 --> 01:25:00,360
And fight this. Please fight this because once they get their food in the door, and that's where they're making such a big deal of porn.

1995
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:06,360
Once they get their food in the door, you know, basically that destroys your free speech.

1996
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:13,360
And, you know, what's next? You know, then it'll be something else that's illegal or bad for children.

1997
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:19,360
And you just can't let this shit go by. It doesn't mean that, you know, we don't have a job to do as parents.

1998
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:23,360
And as human beings and as citizens.

1999
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:31,360
The internet network citizens of the globe doesn't mean that we don't have some responsibility with our freedom.

2000
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,360
But don't let the government tell you what you can and can't see.

2001
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:40,360
And please send me Aussie porn quickly before it's out of bounds.

2002
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:48,360
Plenty of people drop this link into the show notes as well as email that to me about the giant database.

2003
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:53,360
They're planning in the United Kingdom. Now, of course, this is only for your protection.

2004
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:57,360
And we're not necessarily going to keep the content of your email message.

2005
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:02,360
Just know only what time you sent one and who you sent it to. Oh, like that's okay.

2006
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:07,360
And we'll throw out the actual message. Yeah, right. Like I'm supposed to believe that.

2007
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:12,360
The BBC calling it an Orwellian plan.

2008
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:16,360
Say, funny for them to say it.

2009
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:21,360
Here it is. Communications data. That is data about calls such as the location and identity of the caller.

2010
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:28,360
Not the content of the calls themselves as used as important evidence in 95% of serious crime cases.

2011
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:33,360
And almost all security service operations since 2004.

2012
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:40,360
Sure, let's try to prevent crime instead of making taking away our freedom to solve it.

2013
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:47,360
Let's try and prevent it by getting people jobs and getting them giving them hope and let's give our children some hope.

2014
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:53,360
Let's give them something to look forward to. Let them laugh and be happy as the song says.

2015
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:58,360
Anyway, here's Jackie Smith, the home secretary.

2016
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:03,360
Of course deals with all security here in the United Kingdom. This link in the show notes as well. Just look at her.

2017
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,360
She's, she's a total reptile.

2018
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:09,360
Ugh, you know, let's see what she has to say.

2019
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:19,360
Our ability to intercept communications and obtain communications data is vital to fighting terror.

2020
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:25,360
I just had to back that up. I was going to say it's vital to fighting terror.

2021
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:28,360
Of course, fighting terror.

2022
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:31,360
We're also terrified. Please read my email.

2023
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:37,360
Oh, and by the way, I did not be sending any sexy pictures with my email because that would be dangerous for the recipient.

2024
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:40,360
It could be intercepted by the children.

2025
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:47,360
Some out of combating serious crime including child sex abuse murders and drug trafficking.

2026
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,360
Of course.

2027
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:57,360
Communication's data. That is data about calls such as the location and identity of the caller.

2028
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,360
Not the content of the calls themselves.

2029
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:04,360
You know what, Jackie Smith, you think you're smart, right?

2030
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:07,360
You think you're doing the right thing here. They're coming for you.

2031
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,360
They'll get you to.

2032
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,360
Do you know that you send fucking naked pictures through email?

2033
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:16,360
We all do it. You know you say sexy shit.

2034
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:19,360
It's hard to believe looking at you and I'm sorry to go there.

2035
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:22,360
But I'm just so angry at what you're doing.

2036
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:29,360
You're already so easy to get a phone tap here in Britain or email tap.

2037
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:37,360
And they're they're sponsored. They're teaching our kids how to paddle tail on the their own families and neighbors and paying them for it.

2038
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:40,360
Calling the little cyber cop brigades.

2039
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:43,360
People like Jackie Smith are sitting all of that up.

2040
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:47,360
It's horrendous. Get rid of her. I wish I could vote here. Get rid of her.

2041
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:51,360
Come on. You can't chuckle heads. Get rid of her.

2042
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:56,360
If used as important evidence in 95% of serious crime cases.

2043
01:28:56,360 --> 01:29:04,360
Again, can we just let people be free and go and fight the reasons for this crime?

2044
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:07,360
Fight the crime itself?

2045
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,360
Prevention?

2046
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:12,360
Anything. But taking away our freedoms.

2047
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:16,360
Because, you know, then everyone's going to break some kind of law somewhere somehow.

2048
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:20,360
Because it'll be dangerous and inappropriate for children.

2049
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:25,360
And in almost all security service operations since 2004.

2050
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:31,360
But the communications revolution has been rapid in this country.

2051
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:39,360
And the way in which we intercept communications and collect communications data needs to change too.

2052
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:44,360
If it doesn't, we will lose this vital capability.

2053
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,360
We're going to die.

2054
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:50,360
And that was certain extent. We now all take for granted.

2055
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:59,360
The capability that enabled us to convict Ian Huntley for the same.

2056
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,360
For what? For Tara?

2057
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:13,360
That enabled us to achieve convictions for those responsible for the 217 terrorist plot against London.

2058
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:16,360
What?

2059
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:19,360
The 217?

2060
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,360
Does she mean 777? What's 217?

2061
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:24,360
It's not that again.

2062
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:30,360
The action of the technological and behavioral changes that the growth of the internet brings.

2063
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:35,360
Once again, it is not a government policy, which is somehow optional.

2064
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:39,360
It's a reality to which government needs to be able to respond.

2065
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,360
This is just despicable.

2066
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:44,360
This is so disgusting the thing she's saying.

2067
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:49,360
We are taking away your freedom because it's our duty to do so.

2068
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:54,360
The changes that we need to make may require legislation.

2069
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:58,360
The safeguards we will want to put in place certainly will.

2070
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:01,360
And we may need legislation.

2071
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:06,360
That's right. The safeguards. The same ones that protects our data, which you seem to lose every other week.

2072
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:09,360
You're losing our data. That's the safeguards you think.

2073
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,360
That's a standard that you're going to live up to.

2074
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:15,360
Test what a solution to this problem will look like.

2075
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:19,360
But before proceeding to legislation,

2076
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:23,360
unclear that we need to consult widely with the public.

2077
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:27,360
And other interested parties to set out the emerging problem.

2078
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:31,360
Okay, this is important because I believe we get to have some form of a voice here, listen up.

2079
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:37,360
The important capability gaps that we need to address and to look at possible solutions.

2080
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:41,360
We also need to agree what safeguards will be needed.

2081
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:49,360
In addition to the many that we have in place already to provide a solid legal framework that protects civil liberties.

2082
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:54,360
Yeah, how about this? Don't read my email, okay? How about that for a framework?

2083
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:58,360
This consultation will begin in the new year.

2084
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:02,360
I mean, I have conversations with my lawyers over email.

2085
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:05,360
That should be private. You should have, you have no right.

2086
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:09,360
You have no right whatsoever.

2087
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:12,360
Yeah, before you know it, if they want you for anything.

2088
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,360
If you've got a big mouth, for example,

2089
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:18,360
you know, then it's going to be like, well, you know, you have cyber sex.

2090
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:25,360
And you're downloading naughty things and you're looking at web pages that are anti-government.

2091
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,360
And you're a bad dude. That's how it happens.

2092
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,360
That's how it works. That's how the police state goes.

2093
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:32,360
And then they're not going on your door.

2094
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:34,360
No, then I'm going to knock the going to ram it in.

2095
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:36,360
And they'll come and take you away.

2096
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,360
To the funny farm.

2097
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:41,360
To be combined with a well informed debate,

2098
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:45,360
characterized by openness rather than mere opinion,

2099
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:48,360
by reason and reasonableness.

2100
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:51,360
In this, as in the other work that we do,

2101
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,360
my aim is to achieve a consensus.

2102
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:56,360
And I hope that others will approach the serious issues

2103
01:32:56,360 --> 01:33:01,360
posed for our national security capabilities in the same spirit.

2104
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:04,360
So let me set the terms for that open and reasonable debate.

2105
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:07,360
Now I'll be clear on what we're not going to do.

2106
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:11,360
There are no plans for an enormous database,

2107
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:14,360
which will contain the content of your emails,

2108
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:20,360
the text that you send or the chats that you have on phone or online.

2109
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:23,360
Okay, so right there, there's not going to be the content,

2110
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:26,360
but they're going to know who you chatted with and when you chatted with them.

2111
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:29,360
Who you called? And of course, they'll actually have that information,

2112
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:32,360
but they're not going to store it, at least not for a long time.

2113
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:33,360
You watch.

2114
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:38,360
Nora, are we going to give local farted the power to troll through such a database?

2115
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:43,360
No, the authorities already have the power to actually listen to your conversations,

2116
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:48,360
as well known and documented its legal councils in the United Kingdom

2117
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:54,360
can ask for a wire tap either for the internet or for telephony.

2118
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,360
So it's not, yeah, because then no,

2119
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:58,360
so maybe they don't get to troll through the database,

2120
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:00,360
but they can do whatever they want.

2121
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,360
They can build their own database if they wish.

2122
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:04,360
That's how it'll work.

2123
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:07,360
Interest of the investigating lower level criminality

2124
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,360
under the spirits cover of counter terrorist legislation.

2125
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:11,360
I'm sick of this.

2126
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,360
If you want to see a go to the show,

2127
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:14,360
and check it out.

2128
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,360
Well, you know, I was just singing that song.

2129
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,360
I'm thinking, I got to see if I can find that.

2130
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,360
Let me see.

2131
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:19,360
There we go.

2132
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,360
That's right, Jackie Smith.

2133
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,360
Everybody, here's what she's doing us.

2134
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:26,360
Remember when you ran away and I got on my knees

2135
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:30,360
and begged you not to leave because I go berserk.

2136
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:31,360
Yes?

2137
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,360
Well, you left me anyhow,

2138
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,360
and then the days got worse and worse,

2139
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:39,360
and now you see I've gone completely out of my mind.

2140
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,360
Come.

2141
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:42,360
They're coming to take me away.

2142
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:43,360
Uh-huh.

2143
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,360
They're coming to take me away.

2144
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:45,360
Uh-huh.

2145
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,360
Yeah, uh-huh.

2146
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:49,360
To the 25 where life is beautiful.

2147
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:53,360
All the time, then I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their green light.

2148
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,360
So they're coming to take me away.

2149
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:56,360
Uh-huh.

2150
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:01,360
You thought it was a joke and so you laughed.

2151
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:06,360
You laughed when I had said that losing you would make me flip my lip.

2152
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:07,360
Roller.

2153
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:08,360
You know you laughed.

2154
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,360
I heard you laughed.

2155
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,360
You laughed.

2156
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:11,360
You laughed.

2157
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,360
You laughed.

2158
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,360
And you laughed.

2159
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,360
But now you know I'm utterly mad.

2160
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:18,360
And they're coming to take me away.

2161
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:19,360
Uh-huh.

2162
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,360
They're coming to take me away.

2163
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:22,360
Uh-huh.

2164
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,360
To the fucking bottom.

2165
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:32,360
With trees and flowers and chirping birds and basket weirder to sit and smile and twirl and come and tell the existence of your way.

2166
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,360
Uh-huh.

2167
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,360
I thought you're fooled.

2168
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:42,360
I couldn't your house and this is how you pay me back for all my kind on selfish loving deeds.

2169
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:43,360
Uh-huh.

2170
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,360
Well, you just wait.

2171
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:45,360
They'll find you yet.

2172
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:50,360
And when they do they'll put you in the ASPCA you'll manage it.

2173
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:52,360
Uh-huh.

2174
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:54,360
They're coming to take me away.

2175
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:55,360
Uh-huh.

2176
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,360
They're coming to take me away.

2177
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:58,360
Uh-huh.

2178
01:35:58,360 --> 01:35:59,360
But funny harm.

2179
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:08,360
We're life is beautiful all the time and although the happy to see those nice young men in the Kuwait White coast and they're coming to take me away.

2180
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:09,360
Uh-huh.

2181
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:13,360
The hair will be free because of love and the jeeping birds and basket.

2182
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:16,360
We made this very young wild and beautiful image and so on.

2183
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,360
They're coming to take you away.

2184
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:25,920
Napoli in the 14th on the spur of the moment. That was cool. I could find that they're coming to take me away

2185
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,400
That's exactly what's happening. They are coming to take us all away. You got a big mouth

2186
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:34,400
They'll find something to take you away. Hopefully. I'll just be so old by the time they come to take me away

2187
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,400
That they'll take pity on me

2188
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:41,120
All right, I'm gonna wrap this up. I do have one more song. I want to play in conjunction with this next story

2189
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:45,520
which is Canada. It's quite an amazing amazing. Amazing place. I saw that

2190
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:50,680
Historic record low turn out for their most recent election

2191
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:53,640
Very very low turnout for them

2192
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:58,240
Which just shows the apathy, but one thing's and maybe this is related

2193
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:04,800
Something very interesting about Canada in many provinces. They're pretty laid back when it comes to marijuana and

2194
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:11,440
There's this lively video titled pot 2008 that I wanted to share with you

2195
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:18,480
The system designed to protect individual liberty will have no fun. It's unbelievable even this story about Canada starts with Dr. Ron Paul

2196
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,640
Listen to it though. There's some funky stuff going on up there

2197
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:25,400
Particularly when it comes to our own drugs are in the United States

2198
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:30,560
But of course Ron Paul lays it out flat out first and tells you that it's bullshit the war on drugs as we know

2199
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:36,360
It's well documented many many places the governments of the world are running the drugs

2200
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:38,580
What do you think we're doing in Afghanistan?

2201
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:41,100
95% of all of the poppy is

2202
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:49,500
grown there heroin comes from there cocaine comes from there as a whole bunch of reasons why and how the cash flows into wall street

2203
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:56,660
You can google that there's many and look at the daily source code drop drop dot IO slash daily source code many many good stories

2204
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,900
detailing you know whistle blowers

2205
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:06,660
You name it it's there crashes of big planes filled with cocaine government planes

2206
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:14,580
And that's why they I think the U.S. doesn't want and they don't like marijuana at all

2207
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:20,300
Cuz it's you need too much of it to make money to make any serious money and anyone can grow it

2208
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:27,540
So they want people hooked on their shit not the the stuff given from God the holy herb that job put on the earth for us to smoke

2209
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:31,740
Now they want us to have the evil shit. They make up in laboratory

2210
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:33,820
For any group and no

2211
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:36,620
Privileges today. I think inner city folks

2212
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:40,860
and minorities are punished unfairly in the war on drugs for instance

2213
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:52,420
Blacks make up 14% of those who've used drugs get 36% of those arrested are blacks and it ends out the 63% of those who finally end up in prisons are

2214
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:53,420
Blacks

2215
01:38:53,420 --> 01:39:00,460
This has to change we don't have to have more courts and more prisons. We need to repeal the whole war on drugs

2216
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:02,540
It isn't working

2217
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:07,020
Dr. Ron Paul he is blacker than Barack Obama listen to that man. He's so right

2218
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:09,580
He really gives a shit about people

2219
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:12,380
Stupid war on drugs and

2220
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:17,820
By the way our prison system completely commercialized that'll happen everywhere else. It's already happening in Europe

2221
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:23,820
Commercial prisons they get paid for prisoner. Let's just pick people up and throw them in jail

2222
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:28,780
We make money that way. It's just like the pharmaceutical industry. They make money by injecting bad shit into our kids

2223
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:33,340
It wasn't long ago. They Canada was on the brink of decriminalization

2224
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:41,260
We will soon introduce legislation to decriminalize position of small amounts of marijuana

2225
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:46,700
God smart start to smoke right away

2226
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:56,300
There's a feeling that the serious threat posed by marijuana and the particular company Canada is being ignored. I think

2227
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:57,900
Um

2228
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:59,900
joking about it

2229
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:08,060
Makes that worse John Walters the White House drugs are himself was dispatched from Washington to personally deter us from legalizing pot

2230
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:17,260
Lordy Lordy the anti-Christ himself is coming to Vancouver. Good god John Walters the White House drugs are from the imperial

2231
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:19,020
United States

2232
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:24,940
Did you should see this video the guy stood behind a desk with a pile a weed on an unbelievable pile of birds

2233
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:31,100
Arriving in Vancouver next Wednesday. I would legalize this and I would tax the live and hell out of it

2234
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:35,660
Larry Campbell met with the drugs are when he dropped in to visit Vancouver

2235
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:38,620
The drugs are is idiot

2236
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:41,820
A complete and totally idiot

2237
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:45,500
I mean he tried to explain to me that marijuana was the

2238
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:51,100
Was the most dangerous drug and was the most addictive drug

2239
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:53,740
Any idea

2240
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:55,740
And I didn't understand how that was

2241
01:40:57,100 --> 01:41:02,700
Yeah, you know, absolutely really my friends. It's a dangerous drug because you start to think straight

2242
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:06,060
And start to tell people about the true privacy

2243
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:08,620
The sun for me

2244
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:11,900
I'm going to Canada

2245
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:22,620
This

2246
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:24,620
I'm not much with you, it's in

2247
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:29,620
It's real, oh, magic round

2248
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:36,620
There's no cut, call us, oh, raising up on the steering

2249
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:38,620
And round those magic on

2250
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:42,620
But you'll never live so long to her

2251
01:41:42,620 --> 01:41:44,620
For her callable in room

2252
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:48,620
Holy snake tales, but just the few

2253
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:50,620
Get ready to sing along, you love it

2254
01:41:51,620 --> 01:41:53,620
She likes wings

2255
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:57,620
There is it to grow

2256
01:41:58,620 --> 01:42:01,620
There is it to grow

2257
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:04,620
Is it to grow in one morning due

2258
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,620
She likes wings

2259
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:11,620
There is it to grow

2260
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:16,620
And there is all that

2261
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:20,620
Every well when she needs a view

2262
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:38,620
But she also keeps a kept awesome

2263
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:41,620
And the miles fire in screaming

2264
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:45,620
Raven, a magic stick, a flying broom

2265
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:47,620
I'm just a few things

2266
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:52,620
That she feels in her room

2267
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:56,620
She likes wings

2268
01:42:57,620 --> 01:42:59,620
There is it to grow

2269
01:43:01,620 --> 01:43:03,620
There is it to grow

2270
01:43:04,620 --> 01:43:07,620
Is it to grow in one morning due

2271
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:10,620
She likes wings

2272
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:14,620
There is it to grow

2273
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:18,620
And there is all that

2274
01:43:19,620 --> 01:43:22,620
Every well when she needs a view

2275
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:38,620
She likes wings

2276
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:42,620
There is it to grow

2277
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:45,620
There is it to grow

2278
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:49,620
Is it to grow in the morning due

2279
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:52,620
She likes wings

2280
01:43:55,620 --> 01:43:56,620
There is it to grow

2281
01:43:56,620 --> 01:43:59,620
It was a super smash back in the 60s

2282
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:02,620
I think it was actually 68

2283
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:04,620
Maybe it was a huge on all the pirate radio ships

2284
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:06,620
And the North Sea, the T-Set

2285
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:08,620
She likes wings

2286
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:10,620
They are easy to grow a Dutch band

2287
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:14,620
And of course they didn't actually write lyrics

2288
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:16,620
They just put a whole bunch of songs

2289
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:18,620
Works together that rhyme

2290
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:22,620
But considering it is this song about being hammer

2291
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:24,620
Kind of works

2292
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:28,620
Alrighty

2293
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:31,620
And that will do it for episode number 799

2294
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:34,620
Well hit 800 sometimes this coming week

2295
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:37,620
Again no agenda being recorded on Sunday

2296
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:41,620
So if you are in the states it will be somewhere

2297
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:43,620
And the morning slash afternoon

2298
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:45,620
That you will be able to get the show

2299
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:47,620
And of course just appropriately

2300
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:49,620
For your time zone

2301
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:52,620
Please feel free to send me porn from down under

2302
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:53,620
Very curious

2303
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:56,620
And even better if it is your boyfriend or girlfriend

2304
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:57,620
In the picture

2305
01:44:57,620 --> 01:44:58,620
Or the two of you together

2306
01:44:58,620 --> 01:45:00,620
I'm just hinting it some suggestions

2307
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:02,620
I mean we might as well take advantage of our freedom

2308
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:03,620
While we still can

2309
01:45:03,620 --> 01:45:04,620
We know what I'm talking about

2310
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:06,620
So bear that in mind

2311
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:08,620
Put your freedom to good use

2312
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:10,620
And live your life with passion

2313
01:45:10,620 --> 01:45:12,620
Another fine medial presentation

2314
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:14,620
Stick it in your ear
