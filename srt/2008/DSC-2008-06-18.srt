1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There was a basic radio, terrestrial radio, and then there was satellite radio until the

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
prices brought us back to Earth.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,880
Finally, we had the daily source code.

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,880
We could enjoy, we could take it with us, we could shove it in our ears.

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,880
So here's Adam Curry with the DSC 770.

6
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:13,880
Only boys and your lonely girls hear the end of the lonely world you're finding out

7
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:22,880
if there's someone to cry about, only girls and your lonely boys playing alone with your lonely

8
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,880
only boys will not be blue because there's no one to play with you.

9
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,880
Yes, I've forgotten yourself, no you sure.

10
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,880
I can't recall myself, but it feels good.

11
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,880
Yes, I've forgotten yourself, take my advice.

12
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,880
I can't recall myself, but it feels nice.

13
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,880
When the lights come on and the parties through there always feel with nobody to do.

14
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,880
Well, now don't despair, you'll eventually get there.

15
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:13,880
And then while all of the lonely ones hear what you do while you wait for the sun to rise above,

16
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,880
the only is kind of old.

17
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,880
Yes, I've forgotten yourself, no you sure.

18
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:29,880
I can't recall myself, but it feels good.

19
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,880
Yes, I've forgotten yourself, take my advice.

20
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,880
I can't recall myself, but it feels nice.

21
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,880
When the feel lights come on and the parties through there always feel nice.

22
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,880
When the feel lights come on and the parties through there always feel nice.

23
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,880
Yes, I've forgotten yourself, take my advice.

24
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,880
I can't recall myself, but it feels good.

25
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:24,880
Yes, I've forgotten myself, but it feels good.

26
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,880
Yes, I've forgotten myself, but it feels good.

27
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,880
I'm gonna find yourself in the ocean

28
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,880
I got to put myself in the sea to the sky

29
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,880
I'm gonna find myself in the ocean

30
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
I'm gonna find myself in the ocean

31
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,880
I think this clearly falls under the prostate cancer prevention

32
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Kota songs

33
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Seven Sonic all about chemistry

34
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Get a grip

35
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,880
I got a grip on myself and it feels good

36
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,880
And would you like to get a grip on someone else?

37
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,880
No

38
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,880
I found that on the source code drop daily sore

39
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Drop that I always slash daily source code

40
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,880
Yeah, fits. It really does fit

41
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,880
Of course, you know all kinds of metaphors for getting a grip on yourself like

42
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Hey, how you doing everybody?

43
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,880
It's daily source code number 770

44
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,880
I got a firm grip on myself here coming to you from the curry manner upstairs in the atoms attic

45
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,880
We're on the west side of G-town

46
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
The affluent suburb of Surrey known as Gill

47
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,880
For not a very nice day today. It looks like we're in for a kind of some shitty weather for the next few days

48
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,880
It's all been kind of down south near France and Spain and Italy actually

49
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,880
Not Spain but Italy and France

50
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,880
Oh, you notice I'm slipping more into my UK accent every single day

51
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
I got to be careful of that

52
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,880
Hey, I had a pretty interesting experience this morning

53
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Something I'm trying to set up for the chuckle heads out there

54
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
I spoke to a member of European Parliament

55
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,880
He's a Dutch guy. His name is Tuan Mondeurs

56
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,880
I think it is. I'm going to check. Yeah

57
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
And

58
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
You know because I'm kind of looking for people who are

59
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Well, first of all, you know that I own of course voted no in this Lisbon treaty

60
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
And now we have to see what happens

61
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,880
Remember even the president over there at the commission or

62
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
Or parliament or whatever it is

63
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
That's so complicated

64
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,880
He said there's no plan B

65
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,880
You know that's that was kind of the message

66
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
If Ireland votes it down if they votes down

67
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Vote down this Lisbon treaty which is kind of a version of the constitution that was voted down in 2005 by the Dutch and by the French

68
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,880
Then that's it, you know, then they have to go back to the drawing board

69
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,880
And you know, so immediately after the Irish voted this down

70
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,880
Yeah, there's all kinds of rumblings going on in Brussels and Strasbourg

71
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Because of course the European Parliament doesn't just have one seat of government

72
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,880
They have two places to sit

73
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,880
That's that's a whole story into itself

74
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
And

75
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,880
You know there's all kinds of posturing and people talking about well maybe two out of three

76
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
We'll do another vote

77
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,880
So I'm looking for people who are really in the midst of it all

78
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,880
And so this guy is not just a member of the European Parliament

79
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
But he's also

80
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,880
He was actually angry

81
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,880
And here and I spoke to him in Dutch but the guy speaks perfectly

82
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,880
I'm going to invite him to come on to the show and see

83
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,880
So it won't be until next week because they've got all kinds of meetings going on this week

84
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
In Strasbourg and they're trying to figure this out

85
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,880
But essentially he said that it was unconscionable

86
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,880
That 800,000 people from Ireland could hold half a million people in Europe hostage

87
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,880
He literally used the word hostage

88
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,880
And you know, that's like, you know when Comister blogger says it is like one thing

89
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,880
But to hear a minister of European Parliament speak that way

90
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,880
Well particularly when his own country the Netherlands three years ago

91
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,880
Apparently held Europe hostage by voting no to the Lisbon Treaty

92
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,880
But of course he never used those words then

93
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,880
Then it was like, oh well we didn't explain it properly

94
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Or we have to do a better job next time

95
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,880
And it's obvious if the French had voted no

96
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,880
Then maybe the Dutch would be the old Irish

97
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
So now the Irish are the new Irish

98
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
And he went on to say

99
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,880
The things that our European correspondents of Ontario fellow chucklehead CSB

100
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Has indeed said verbatim

101
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,880
That Ireland receives a billion euros a year

102
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,880
And that thanks to participation in the EU they are what they are today

103
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,880
And they've got big multinationals flowing into the country

104
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,880
And that this is really just a bunch of sheep farmers

105
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Can you believe this shit?

106
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,880
He said a bunch of sheep farmers

107
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,880
Who just want to hold on to their subsidies and don't want taxes to change

108
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,880
And he said just the top it all off

109
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,880
We're going to find out where Ireland wants to be a member of the European Union

110
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,880
Or not in essence saying well you know if the rest of the so there's eight

111
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
More member states that have to ratify

112
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,880
I believe Britain ratifies today I think

113
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,880
So they have a total of 26 with this just iron on this leftover

114
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,880
They're going to get kicked out of the EU

115
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,880
And this is crazy

116
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,880
This is absolutely nuts

117
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
And what just surprised me was the aggression

118
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,880
Which with which he was talking

119
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,880
He was like whoa you know hold on man

120
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,880
Look everyone's in this boat together

121
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,880
And the deal was all everyone says yes or or it's no go

122
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,880
And of course the Irish were the only ones who got a referendum

123
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,880
I'm pretty sure if more

124
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,880
Members states were allowed to hold a referendum

125
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,880
You would have had more nose

126
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,880
And it's not even the context of the content of the document

127
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
No one understands what's in there

128
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
I certainly don't

129
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,880
I've tried to figure it out right here on this very program

130
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
So anyway that's just my European update

131
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
I was just flabbergasted by that

132
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
So we got to keep our eye on the situation here

133
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,880
John C. Dvorak over the weekend on no agenda

134
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,880
I had no agenda.mevio.com

135
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,880
He said it sounded like a fascist state takeover

136
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,880
Which you know

137
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Wow you know I wouldn't want to go that far

138
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,880
But why not? It does sound a bit like that

139
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,880
It's crazy stuff going on my friends

140
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
It's big forces at work

141
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Really really really big forces that we have

142
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Absolutely no idea what's really

143
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,880
I mean well we can only have ideas and thoughts about it

144
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,880
Here's something there's another thing on the on the

145
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,880
The source code drop drop dot IO slash daily source code

146
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,880
Look for this title cbc

147
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,880
It's an audio show the current

148
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,880
As I think what the name of the program is

149
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
So that's a Canadian broadcasting corporation

150
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,880
I'm just going to read the caption for this because you got to go listen to this

151
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,880
To this 26 minute piece

152
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,880
Ready for the Wall Street types to screw up food prices just as they have oil prices

153
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,880
It reads seems there is rampant speculation going on in the agriculture industry

154
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Everything from farmland fertilizer and grain silo companies are being bought and sold at record prices

155
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,880
Once again

156
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,880
Just like oil right now

157
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,880
This is not necessarily a complete supply and demand issue

158
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,880
This is a loophole that you know now the law is not past yet

159
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,880
But this is going to be closed sometime by October

160
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,880
And this is the same one that end that end run used before that loophole is closed

161
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,880
To cause rolling blackouts in California

162
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,880
It's a scam people it's a freaking scam

163
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,880
And we're being diverted in all kinds of directions and where's journalism at this point

164
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Yeah business journalism is catching on to it finally

165
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,880
But please let's show who these people are

166
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,880
It's the guys wearing dockers and khakis and blue shirts and yelling into telephones at 430 in the morning

167
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,880
And a lot of it a lot of that trade is taking place right here in London

168
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,880
We've got to stop it, you know, this is this is an outrage

169
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,880
And we're getting mad at the wrong people and we're protesting in the wrong places

170
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Because it literally is happening on the trading floor of the commodities stock markets

171
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
Or the commodities markets

172
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,880
Trading markets

173
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,880
And now this shit with food

174
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Oh man and you know, so now the latest news came out yesterday inflation

175
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,880
Remember I talked about the word stagflation

176
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,880
Which means that we kind of have the economy is slowing down yet prices are going up

177
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,880
That's exactly what's happening. It's this unfortunate combination of

178
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,880
Of oil going through the roof

179
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Well, we have a financial crisis which essentially messed up interest rates

180
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,880
So you know now it's like everyone has to choose both the United States and Europe now from from everything I'm hearing

181
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Particularly in the UK where inflation and rose

182
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Fort will will have risen to 4% by the end of this year

183
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
Which means people have to have more money

184
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,880
You know that's we're going to have a lot of striking going on in a country like the like England or Britain

185
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,880
United Kingdom you'll see a lot of those

186
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,880
And you know there's less money available

187
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,880
So do they raise interest rates to stop the inflation?

188
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,880
Which of course suppresses the economy even more because it's harder for people to borrow money

189
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,880
Or do they lower interest rates so that there's more money flowing people can have access to more cash

190
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,880
We can get back into buying houses, which is almost at a standstill

191
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,880
But then of course you know you risk

192
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Hey, I know I'm no economist as you can tell but this is definitely a messed up situation

193
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, anyway

194
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,880
Actually, I had to know about something about the UK inflation

195
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Let me just see what that is. I'm going to just open it. Oh, it's Sanders research associate. Yeah, it's it's a complicated issue

196
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:38,880
But you know, please where is it where is the the mainstream media on this are they just lazy or they're not understand or they're just

197
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Just buying the the answers that are provided for them. I mean come on

198
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,880
This is like the biggest secret now. It's driving me nuts

199
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,880
All right, let's go on over to

200
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Actually, so I did you know on Monday there was just so much that came in over the weekend

201
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Mondays are just getting tough it like takes a long time to go through everything

202
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,880
So I still want to crank out shows on Monday and then have someone that's spill over on the Tuesday or Wednesday

203
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:12,880
So the question that was posed to our Savanta do nuclear atomic rod was you know just how safe are these nuclear power plants now

204
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,880
We've been talking about this for quite a while. I'm getting pretty convinced here by atomic rod who by the way does work for us

205
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
He works for the for the US government

206
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:28,880
I'm pretty convinced that these the new technology the pebble reactors are much safer than of course three mile island Chernobyl etc

207
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:39,880
And the nuclear waste is much smaller much more convenient to take care of than we ever thought of before certainly seems like there's a lot less of it than I imagine

208
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:48,880
And then of course the I guess like the final thing that people always want to demunk nuclear nuclear energy on is terrorism

209
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,880
That's a big one for our administration. Of course our oil guys and don't want us to try much else

210
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Uh, and that would be the strength of of these plants and can someone blow them up and will we all die?

211
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,880
That of course or whatever one wants to know so atomic rod doodifully calls in

212
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Hey Adam it's atomic rod. I'm here and I'm here to answer a question from Steve and the Bay Area

213
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:33,880
With regard to the vulnerability of nuclear plants to terrorism of terrorists attacks all I can say is I'm extremely confident of their ability to withstand damage, especially compared to all other energy sources

214
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:44,880
I've been at nuclear plants that can tell you that the containment buildings are about three to four foot thick reinforced concrete with the

215
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:56,880
We bar that reinforces a concrete about as thick as my forearm. I'm not real concerned about any release of right out to materials from an attack on a nuclear plant

216
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:09,880
And then our sea of pretty much agrees with what I have to say lots of other energy facilities have been attacked many times since night 11 oil pipelines gas pipelines refineries tankers

217
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:17,880
But there haven't been any real attacks on any new clear plants terrorists are probably smart enough to avoid the hard targets

218
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:24,880
You know they work for us and by the way I'm looking to you from watching DC sitting in freedom of square

219
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,880
So I'm looking to protect your freedom by and we know you are rod and we appreciate it very much

220
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Some of them do indeed feel that they work for us. Yeah, that's a good point. There's been all kinds of terrorist activity on the

221
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,880
On fossil fuel bay stuff

222
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,880
But yeah, the hard targets just seemed to not be there and of course this was due to a comment from Monday show where

223
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,880
I forget who it was who called in and said look you know a lot of talk about two nuclear plants in the Bay area

224
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,880
And there's no extra protection that's going on because it's not needed. That's the bottom line. So all this expensive fuel

225
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Ah, we're being we're being duped. I'm telling you I am not the only one saying this pass it on. It's not just it's not just the big oil companies

226
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:17,880
It's not just the government with their CO2 emissions taxes on on engines if they they all may be in cohorts for all

227
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,880
I know, but it's definitely unnecessary

228
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Hey, I found it's Mark Mark's thing cool. I mentioned how extensive flying is and here in the United States

229
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,880
There's a way to fly not so expensively. Can't wait for this

230
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Recently, they came out the new light sport license which

231
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:49,880
Okay, a smaller planes to see their planes. You're flying about 120 knots which are like this. No one 50. I'm steroids

232
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,880
And it costs about half of the cost to get your license.

233
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Yeah, yeah, Mark. Absolutely. I mean for for flying and learning how to fly absolutely there are definitely alternatives

234
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,880
I mean you can even start off with the gliders, you know, they can go to a motor glider, which I think some of the even work on batteries

235
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,880
But you know, I use my aircraft for transportation mainly because I just, you know, I can't be wasting an entire day

236
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:20,880
Hopping across the puddle from the UK to the the main continent and it takes that, you know, with all the security checks and just

237
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,880
It takes so long and it's getting more expensive and less flights are available. I need more flexibility

238
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:38,880
So I use it as transportation and the LSAs although certainly great aircraft and fund a fly not appropriate for the real transportation as I need it unfortunately

239
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,880
I add a mixture of color. I did the number constant on your field consumption to your plane 60 liters an hour

240
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Covering under 70 miles across the ground. Oh, I'm so happy he finally did this. Okay, so I was talking about the price of fuel to fill up the Delta Sierra

241
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,880
Which is it's not a huge plane, but it's not it's not a you know, such as a trainer or anything. It's a 180 to retractable gear

242
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,880
It's fully IFR you can fly instrument on it. It's a it's a great plane. It's the flying station wagon

243
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Okay, the family roundabout in the skies and it is about 16 gallons or a little over 60 liters per hour that I burn

244
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:22,880
And it's you're going to be interested because Pete whenever people hear me talking about flying in a you know in a plane versus driving or any other motor transportation

245
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,880
You know or I often am accused of being a huge polluter

246
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Because I'm flying through the skies with my aircraft listen to these statistics so you're right

247
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:43,880
I'm doing 150 knots about 170 miles per hour at a fuel burn of 60 liters or approximately 16 gallons for the same time period

248
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
Now here comes the number crunching

249
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,880
It's apparently good actually sort of 0.85 miles per imperial gallon

250
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,880
10.72 miles per US gallon

251
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Yep, or for continental measurements 22.06 liters per hundred kilometers

252
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,880
You'd be hard put to do 170 miles an hour in a car and still come out with nearly 13 to the gallon

253
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,880
So that's pretty good and of course you're going in a straight line to cover the same ground in a car

254
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,880
Yeah, we have to do more miles and you see more fuel exactly

255
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,880
I don't need to worry too much just yet

256
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Yeah, no, it's absolutely true. It's absolutely true. You know, that's the big joke is it's a it's a like calming engine

257
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,880
It's like a sports car engine like a

258
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,880
In fact some I believe some aircraft actually have a Corvette engine in them

259
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
So you know, it's something like that

260
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,880
You know, it's a couple hundred horsepower. Now of course it's running at 75

261
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Most of the time your flag is about an average of 75% of the engine. So you'd have your engine revved up for 75% of its power continuously

262
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,880
So that's why it has needs a lot of maintenance and it's you know, it's got to be hanging together there

263
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,880
But it's a flying car. This is why I keep telling you the flying car exists. It just doesn't drive too well

264
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,880
I'm sorry, I want pilot error sorry

265
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,880
I'm pretty Jones this reality podcast quick word fuel. Yeah, I said it's some guy on the news

266
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Petrol station on a down in Devon southwest of England selling unleaded for one ninety-nine

267
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Alita crap two pounds a later and you feel I feel raped is how I feel two pounds a leader

268
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,880
So that's

269
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,880
That's four dollars

270
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
Times three

271
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,880
So it's 12 even more 12 13 bucks a gallon. Yep. Yeah

272
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:52,880
Also big left the Charles a drunk and Londoner Charles. Yeah, real star and a real character keep up the good work

273
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,880
I don't think you're very much. I'll speed you again. Yeah, I work for us. Thanks buddy. Yeah, and he's not just Charles the drunk and London anymore

274
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:07,880
He's now known as Charlie Delta Lima and I told you I had one for call that I had from from yesterday or from Monday

275
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,880
Just listen to it and and of course

276
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
I play this because I love

277
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,880
I can't help it. I drink there four lines drunk

278
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Uh

279
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
Uh

280
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
Yeah

281
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,880
I tell me things what's raining now. I'm actually on a phone apartment was gonna say

282
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Uh, but does anyone else

283
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,880
Sort of lying in bed

284
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Closed your iPhone in through it's evening charge because like you say Charles doesn't last for more than

285
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,880
A little while so

286
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Closed your iPhone in

287
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,880
You see how the other they say children and drunk people always tell the truth

288
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,880
So now it's coming clean on the on the battery life of his iPhone

289
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,880
Yeah, it doesn't last long so he's plugged plug it in at night and then why it's not a 3G I phone

290
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,880
But you know what through his iPhone's changed the way I work the way I live

291
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Uh having it a bit faster

292
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,880
Doesn't mean my life will be fast or will be improved

293
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
There you go

294
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
Alright get to the point Charles

295
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,880
But as anyone lie in a lie in bed

296
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,880
You plug your iPhone in and it's just kind of sitting on the edge of the bed and you turn the light out

297
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,880
And you think I made us to put that on the the chair extra bed or the dress or whatever

298
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,880
And you reach over and you cut it and it feels like it's vibrating

299
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,880
Mm-hmm anyone else had that

300
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,880
It's weird seeing there's something to do with the texture

301
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Now let me just say you of course you were wondering why my playing Charlie Delta Lima to this extent

302
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,880
It's for this very point because I too have noticed and not with of course my iPhone

303
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,880
You know took a

304
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Tank and fill in the toilet and I don't touch that anymore

305
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,880
But I have the iPod Touch now. I don't have it with the iPod Touch but on my old power book

306
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,880
Or MacBook. No, it's not so Macbook. Yes MacBook

307
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,880
Which is now downstairs in the kitchen which Patricia uses very often when I close the cover

308
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,880
I get that like it's it's so the weirdest sensation is like a friction type thing that feels like it's actually vibrating

309
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,880
I know exactly what you're talking about Charles

310
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,880
It is the weirdest thing and I bet you're more people have noticed it

311
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,880
Of the silvery fact of the iPhone that as you brush your hand over it gently

312
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,880
It feels like it's vibrating sort of vibrating

313
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,880
It's something to be detected and it's weird. I've never felt this with any other material

314
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,880
By the only other sort with the iPhone

315
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,880
I'm not entirely sober

316
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
It's not the only time I feel it

317
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,880
And there's nothing mark cannot be alone here

318
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Go to me

319
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
What?

320
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,880
What?

321
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
I'll instead know

322
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
Yeah

323
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,880
Treaty

324
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,880
No, you're going to have to hope

325
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,880
No, I'm not happening

326
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Yeah, who knows

327
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,880
But why do I feel this?

328
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,880
Because Adam Curry told me to say to Felix

329
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,880
All I can say to that is then say oh

330
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
Oh come see

331
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,880
All right, now you're confused Charles

332
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,880
All right, all right, come down now

333
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,880
I

334
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
I love it, though, man

335
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,880
People tell the truth when they're drunk

336
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Another great story that came in

337
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,880
I love this

338
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,880
The performing rights society, PRS

339
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Which is the UK version of Ask Cap BMI

340
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,880
Which collects royalties from musicians in the United Kingdom as accused

341
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,880
Lancashire police of committing copyright infringement

342
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
By playing music and police stations

343
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,880
And to callers on hold without an appropriate license

344
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,880
In a RIT

345
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,880
And that's like a

346
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,880
Legal letter

347
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,880
In Junction or whatever

348
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,880
Whatever a lawyer or a lawyer

349
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
Whatever a lawyer rights is a RIT

350
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,880
In a RIT submitted to the high court

351
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,880
The PRS is called for an injunction and payment of damages

352
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Now, boy

353
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,880
The PRS contains a playing music that is audible to others

354
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
Constituents a public performance

355
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Meaning that it can be done without

356
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
Can't be done without a license

357
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,880
The Lancashire police stations

358
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
Play music in the background

359
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
At office parties

360
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,880
And in staff gyms

361
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,880
And even though they have not purchased licenses

362
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,880
That are enabled to do so legally

363
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
PRS has its attempted to collect license fees

364
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
From police all over the country

365
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
But Lancashire is one of the eleven

366
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
That are refused to pay up

367
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,880
Which is decided why they've decided to take legal action

368
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Isn't that amazing

369
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,880
When you know that these guys are ready to take on the poll lease

370
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,880
You know they mean business

371
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Holy crap

372
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880
And how can I get me some of that money man

373
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,880
What if the cops will listen to my show

374
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,880
Can I get some of that dough?

375
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,880
Why is it only limited to music?

376
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,880
Because you've got the Mafioci on your side

377
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
That's how it's possible

378
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Frick it nuts

379
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,880
And of course

380
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,880
Football is raging over here in Europe

381
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
And then I'll get on to some other topics

382
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
But it's just absolutely raging

383
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,880
Everyone's crazy about what's happening

384
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,880
The Dutch are kicking ass big time

385
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,880
They won from Romania last night

386
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,880
So they're only one of seven teams in history

387
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,880
To score this many points in the European Championships

388
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
So it's a big deal

389
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
And boy there's a lot of talent on the team

390
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
And I got it man

391
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
I'm following it

392
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
I'm not watching every single game

393
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
But the Dutch, yeah

394
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
I think they're definitely on fire

395
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,880
And even though I'm a little late in playing this

396
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
Where this was one game from the Dutch ago

397
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,880
I did want to share with you something that came in from

398
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,880
From Ray

399
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
Who loves to be on the Charlie?

400
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
All we want you tonight is Ray

401
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,880
Hey Anna

402
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,880
Hope it's time to be a part of us again someday

403
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,880
But are you ready for some sucker?

404
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,880
Oh no

405
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
Oh no

406
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,880
This is the Marco from Boston Show

407
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,880
Okay, first I got to give you some facts about the sucker in my life

408
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,880
I don't watch a lot of sucker

409
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,880
Haven't seen the Champions League

410
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,880
It's spite of the final game

411
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,880
I don't follow our national cup or any other 22 men

412
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
Running behind the ball on the field

413
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,880
That sometimes looks more like a swimming ball

414
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
Or a nice field

415
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,880
Switzerland couldn't be any more orange than last Friday's city colours

416
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,880
Bergen turned into one big orange nation

417
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
Got you Marco from Boston Show

418
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,880
There's a real full bar Friday thriller cast

419
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
Wow

420
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,880
I don't know about you Adam but isn't it the most awesome myths

421
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
You've seen in a long time

422
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,880
The sound of Le Maseez

423
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,880
That's the French national anti by the way

424
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,880
Turned after 93 minutes into an orange feeling of love

425
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
Love

426
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
For the emotional shots of our guys

427
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Hawking their kids after a full one win

428
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,880
The French were really not that bad

429
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,880
But the way our 11 nights of the queen

430
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,880
Move their asses over the green grass

431
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,880
Was absolutely a thrill to watch

432
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
Did it get a player of Liverpool?

433
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,880
Scores our first goal

434
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
Oh no no no no

435
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,880
I didn't see the ball

436
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
It is there again

437
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
Did you make up

438
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
Ha ha ha

439
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
Is it lecker?

440
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,880
Rubbing from Perci

441
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
The guy with a bad season at Arsenal

442
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
And most wanted Dutch soccer playing

443
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,880
According to our national being cake community

444
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,880
Booked the second floor

445
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
It's from Perci

446
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
No no no no no no

447
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
We're starting up play now

448
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,880
We're starting up play now

449
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
Are you a robot?

450
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,880
Our road runner from Real Madrid

451
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
3-1

452
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
The ball is on the right

453
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,880
We're starting up

454
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
Oh yeah

455
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,880
This is the Robiner like Wesley Snyder

456
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
A little new one

457
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,880
Recently moved from IX Amsterdam to Real Madrid

458
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,880
We're starting up play now

459
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
And we're starting up play

460
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
We're starting up play

461
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
We're starting up play

462
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
We're starting up play

463
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
Rafa Helfer in the fight

464
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
It's been from their side

465
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Johnny Phillips came in Markov in Boston

466
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
Hell yeah

467
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
This was exciting

468
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,880
This was the one on the point

469
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
The point of your chair

470
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,880
Real soccer freely cast

471
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Next Tuesday

472
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,880
And no matter what match meeting

473
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
With Romania

474
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,880
And then up to the hills of Basel

475
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Europe will be orange

476
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,880
We are going to

477
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Yeah

478
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
Yeah

479
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,880
I'm not sure if he's done yet

480
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,880
All I've done right

481
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,880
I love that montage

482
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,880
And so please

483
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
The reason I'm playing

484
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,880
It was because you put so much work into it

485
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,880
And I just didn't get to it before the game yesterday

486
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
And of course I didn't even

487
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
Manif we win our lose

488
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
In fact, they would actually

489
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
Would have been to the Dutch's advantage if we lost

490
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,880
Because they neither Italy or France

491
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Or I think Sweden

492
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
Whoever

493
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
We wouldn't have any of those good guys in there

494
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,880
And now Italy is through

495
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,880
Because the Dutch beat the Romanian team

496
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,880
By 2 to 0

497
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,880
I love that right

498
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
Fantastic

499
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
What a great job man

500
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
Thank you really really appreciate it

501
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
Yeah, it's European cup fever

502
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Over here everybody

503
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
It's like the Super Super Super Duper Bowl

504
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
In the US, only

505
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
Different

506
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
All right, let me see

507
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
What else do we have here

508
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,880
Oh yeah, I want to talk about

509
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,880
Different forms of

510
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,880
Energy for driving cars

511
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
We talked about the Indian Tata

512
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
The Tata

513
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,880
Which has uses compressed air

514
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
There's electric cars

515
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,880
There's all kinds of stuff going on

516
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
And you guys out there

517
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,880
The chuckle heads you're talking about it

518
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Hello, Adam, this is Peter

519
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,880
And we are slowly less than that

520
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
Pointless above Essex

521
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
No, no, no, don't be that way Peter

522
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,880
In Chelsea

523
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
That's a good spot

524
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,880
Make a quick point about

525
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,880
The idea of compressed aircol

526
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
And it was all a story on the BBC

527
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
About that

528
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,880
About French compressed aircol

529
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
It was well

530
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,880
But I have a video where it

531
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
But he sounds like

532
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
Boxes out

533
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,880
So cupless skeletons

534
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Why didn't you just get 10

535
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
No way wrong

536
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Wait

537
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
Wait

538
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,880
What did you call that?

539
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,880
Boxes out

540
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
So cupless skeletons

541
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
Why didn't you just get 10

542
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
No way wrong

543
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,880
Okay

544
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
Hey man, I mean

545
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
No one said you're going to get laid

546
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
By driving one of these vehicles

547
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Okay, you might save a little bit of the planet

548
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
And you might save yourself some money

549
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,880
But I've never quite heard an engines describe that way

550
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,880
The sound of it is like two skeletons

551
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
Wanking in a biscuit tin

552
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,880
I have to remember that way

553
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,880
These alternate fields

554
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,880
Could better mind

555
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
Not a long ago

556
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
The UK government was looking at

557
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Sort of satellite tracking

558
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,880
For a speculative road pricing

559
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
Interfects

560
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,880
So just the same enjoy these

561
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Sort of nearly free fields

562
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
While again

563
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Because they want belong before

564
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Once they catch on

565
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,880
The government will be charging them on

566
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,880
So

567
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,880
Okay

568
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
Love you no no

569
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
Great how do you win

570
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,880
And they work faster

571
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
Yeah, there you go

572
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,880
Bastards

573
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
Of course there's no avoiding taxes man

574
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
You know that

575
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
Only two certainties in life for death

576
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,880
And taxes

577
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,880
Of course we're going to get tax

578
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
And this is another part of it

579
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
Maybe we're not

580
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,880
Maybe we shouldn't even be looking at trying to

581
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Come up with alternative fuels

582
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,880
Because our economy will tank if we're not

583
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
If we're not using patrol even the way it's tax

584
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,880
And of course the alternative is

585
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
Whatever we're going to use it's going to get tax

586
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
You're absolutely right

587
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,880
But for a while there's going to be a good period

588
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
I think probably five or ten years

589
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,880
We can do all kinds of experimenting

590
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
And save ourselves a couple of bucks

591
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
I like this

592
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
So not just the Indians but the French

593
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,880
Also seem to I guess that

594
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,880
It's not the ta ta guys who have the

595
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,880
Two skeletons wanking in a biscuit tin

596
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,880
Maybe he's the French guys

597
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,880
Jason over in San Diego

598
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,880
About the air car that's supposed to be made in India

599
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,880
The French are making one

600
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,880
Some vehicle designer decided who's going to

601
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Make some air compressed car

602
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,880
And he has a

603
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,880
He has a little coupe

604
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,880
Kind of like a

605
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
Minivan kind of I guess

606
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,880
Yeah

607
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,880
Like a small SUV looking a little thing

608
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,880
And he says you can hold up to like

609
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,880
Five passengers in the big one

610
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,880
And get about 120 miles

611
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,880
To the PSI

612
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,880
I guess

613
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
Whatever it is

614
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,880
The metric is almost unimportant

615
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,880
I mean it costs like 30 cents to fill up your tank with air

616
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,880
Which is everywhere

617
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,880
Anyways

618
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,880
When you buy the car it's only about five to seven grand

619
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,880
And you get a free air compressor

620
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,880
Takes about three hours to fill it up

621
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,880
And I'm going to try to figure out if I can get one of those over here

622
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,880
That would be to hold your sweet

623
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
Yeah, does anyone have a link to that

624
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,880
French company or like dealer sites or something

625
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,880
I don't want to look into this

626
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,880
I mean we should really support this

627
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,880
This is a great idea and it's just genius

628
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
You know compressed air

629
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
Duh

630
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
Get away from the explosion bit all together

631
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,880
And just use

632
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Physics

633
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Love it

634
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
Right now I just filled up my car

635
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,880
Actually I didn't even get to fill it up

636
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,880
75 bucks

637
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
Yeah

638
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,880
It stopped because the pump

639
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,880
The gas pump stopped at $75

640
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,880
And I don't want to swipe my car again

641
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,880
It's still the pain for another whatever it would be

642
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,880
And I don't drive a truck or anything like that

643
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
And you drive VA

644
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,880
But

645
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,880
Yeah

646
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,880
Well I mean you're a man of course you drive a VA

647
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,880
I got you my friend

648
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Yeah

649
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,880
Yeah, so let's approach the problem from two ends

650
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,880
Let's look at these new types of vehicles

651
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
New types of engines

652
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,880
Which really really I think is incredibly smart with compressed air

653
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,880
And in the other hand those guys who are

654
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
Driving up the prices by trading

655
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,880
Let's take them out back and shoot the fuckers

656
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Hey, I don't know this is fall from

657
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
Lake Forest, California

658
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,880
You remember the new clear energy guy?

659
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
Sure, buddy how are you?

660
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,880
I don't get a

661
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,880
Single after just too cold do I?

662
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,880
Uh new clear energy guy

663
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
I didn't think so

664
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
Well I'm sure

665
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,880
So you know do the atomic rod is right about

666
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,880
How much nuclear waste there is in the world

667
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,880
But I do know that wasn't nuclear waste watching up on the shore

668
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,880
Friends William sound back in 1989

669
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,880
Really?

670
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
And you know it's not here again

671
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
I'm sure that was a different form of waste

672
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,880
Technology has improved and I don't know about this

673
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,880
I'm sure some will send me a link to this story

674
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,880
New clear waste washing up on shore

675
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,880
Uranium that I'm currently paying for 30 wait no for 40

676
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,880
I'm sorry for 50 a gallon

677
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,880
Yeah, going for these days

678
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
So that's not why I'm going

679
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,880
I'm calling because in DSC 757 you actually could pay in separate

680
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,880
References to bike ride for curing breast cancer

681
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,880
And the Tata air power car

682
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,880
Yes

683
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,880
And all type of me obvious connection between Tata's

684
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,880
And I thought I'd mention other

685
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,880
There's another way for Chuckleheads to

686
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Sport these search for a cure for breast cancer

687
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
Okay

688
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,880
And let's accompany all save the Tata's

689
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
Amazing what they do as they sell

690
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,880
P-shirts and other stuff with cute low bills

691
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
I like this saved the Tata's

692
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,880
I'm digging it

693
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,880
And they donate 5% of the growth

694
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,880
That's the growth

695
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,880
All the money that comes in, not the profit

696
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
The actual growth

697
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,880
Nice

698
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
To risk cancer research

699
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
Now

700
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,880
And you can get the shirts for both guys and girls

701
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,880
And they've got

702
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,880
And you can get those all at the website

703
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
Yeah

704
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,880
Save the Tata's at home

705
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
Hold on

706
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,880
I made me wondering why I'm bringing all this up

707
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,880
Yes

708
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,880
The Julia, the founder of the company is a friend of mine

709
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
Ah, okay

710
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
I've done solid by me

711
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,880
So I'm doing a little solid by her

712
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,880
And also if you are wearing a Tata's shirt

713
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,880
Maybe you can actually get laid

714
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,880
Well, I'm just writing it

715
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,880
Excellent

716
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
Full circle

717
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,880
Probably the point I'd like to point out that I am trying to make my way

718
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
The photographer, so if there are any female Chuckleheads

719
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,880
I'm really really nice naked pictures too

720
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Oh, I can certainly help

721
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,880
Dude, I'm looking forward to it

722
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Thank you

723
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,880
Crown conclusion

724
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
Yes

725
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,880
I don't care if you're working in Washington, Westminster, or Brussels

726
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
You work for us

727
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
Hell yeah

728
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,880
If you continue to forget that then in the words of that great philosopher

729
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880
Donald Trump

730
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
You're fired

731
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,880
That's right

732
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,880
I'm looking at the site right now

733
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,880
Aha

734
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,880
Great campaign

735
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,880
Finally

736
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
This is a breast cancer awareness campaign

737
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,880
That guys can participate in girls

738
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880
Comparticipating

739
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,880
And it's a nice site

740
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,880
SavetheTata's dot com

741
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,880
And the t-shirt says savetheTata's

742
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Ah

743
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Fantastic

744
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
I love it

745
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
Humor when the chips are down

746
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,880
Because it is a really serious matter

747
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,880
But finally a way to bring

748
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,880
I think they'll bring a lot of awareness to it

749
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
I can use to imagine the academy awards

750
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,880
Instead of just a little ribbon there

751
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
Something, you know, t-shirt

752
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
SavetheTata's baby

753
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,880
You know what I'm saying

754
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
All right

755
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,880
Let's see how we do it on time right now

756
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,880
Wow, it's already 415

757
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
I got so much to do

758
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,880
And we're getting close to the 40 minute mark

759
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Okay

760
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,880
Here's something that a couple people sent me

761
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,880
Links to I think I also saw it on the source code

762
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,880
Drop.au slash daily source code

763
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,880
My sister sent me a copy of it

764
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,880
So I want to play it for you

765
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
It's a video

766
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
If you haven't seen it

767
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,880
You'll want to see the video

768
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
After you hear the audio version of it

769
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,880
It's about two and a half three minutes long

770
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,880
It's from a website called

771
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,880
I'mvotingRepublican.com

772
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,880
And the site consists of basically this video

773
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,880
Titled I'm VotingRepublican

774
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
Enjoy the audio

775
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
It's basically people

776
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,880
And although you may not be able to hear exactly what their

777
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,880
Vocations are because those are listed in titles in the video

778
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,880
You'll catch on pretty quick

779
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:27,880
We're voting Republican because we don't like shopping

780
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,880
It's small neighborhood stores

781
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,880
We don't want the problem with choosing where to shop

782
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,880
And we just love cheap plastic crap from China

783
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,880
I'm voting Republican because I don't really want to cure for AIDS

784
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,880
Or breast cancer

785
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,880
I'm just gazing

786
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,880
I'm voting Republican because I think new drugs should be made available

787
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,880
Immediately whether they've been tested properly or not

788
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,880
If the major pharmaceutical companies bottom lines are healthy

789
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,880
Then I feel healthy too

790
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
But maybe have a good day

791
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,880
I'm voting Republican so that my little Caitlin can be in the classroom

792
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,880
With at least 30 other children

793
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,880
That way she can be challenged by fighting for attention

794
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,880
I'm voting Republican because women just can't be trusted to make decisions

795
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,880
About their own bodies never ever ever

796
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,880
I'm voting Republican because I've already seen a great outdoors

797
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,880
Contouring used to fossil fuels truly is far more important for preserving our natural audums

798
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,880
We're voting Republican because we like a conservative majority on the Supreme Court

799
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,880
We really like knowing that even if we're separate we'll still be called equal

800
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,880
I'm voting Republican because I need to be told who I can love

801
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,880
I told you honey, I need the government to tell me

802
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,880
I just need them to tell me how I can best show a lifetime commitment

803
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,880
And Republican just the folks to do that sweetheart

804
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:53,880
I'm voting Republican because corporations should not have to pay to clean up environmental damage

805
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,880
The EPA is an outmoded idea

806
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,880
If people want clean water

807
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,880
Buy it in a bottle

808
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,880
I'm voting Republican because I don't want to know if the food I'm eating

809
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,880
Spend genetically modified or exposed to radiation

810
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,880
I don't want to have to live with that fear, you know?

811
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,880
So if the label says it's food, that's good enough for me

812
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,880
I'm voting Republican because I really enjoy being screwed by the utility company

813
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,880
We need more minorities in prison

814
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,880
Because hypercars

815
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,880
I just don't feel I deserve health insurance

816
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,880
Because sexist needs more billionaires

817
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:40,880
I'm voting Republican because sometimes the Constitution is just one big inconvenient headache

818
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,880
I think the whole world should be run by one big corporation

819
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,880
I think it'd be so much cozier

820
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,880
Because all other countries are inferior to us

821
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,880
We should start as many wars as we need to keep it that way

822
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,880
So I can stay in Iraq

823
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,880
So I can go to Iran

824
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,880
So if you were thinking about voting something besides Republican

825
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,880
Don't bother

826
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
Stay home

827
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,880
We've got it all taken care

828
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,880
You're getting a sack with you deserve

829
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,880
Yeah?

830
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,880
It does lose a little bit without the video

831
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,880
I have to say what men is this fantastic or what the irony is

832
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,880
It's just so wonderful

833
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,880
I'm voting Republican.com

834
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,880
Have a look at that, my friends

835
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,880
I'll speak to tomorrow

836
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,880
And while it lasts, enjoy your freedom

837
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,880
And live your life with passion

838
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,880
Another fine, medium presentation

839
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,880
Stick it in your ear
