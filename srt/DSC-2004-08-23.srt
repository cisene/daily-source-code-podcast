00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Once again, it's the source code and we're on a Monday 23rd of August 2004.

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,900
Hi everybody, it's Adam Curry coming to you from Curry Castle in Belgium.

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,500
I am exhausted.

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:32,940
It's been an incredibly long day which of course started with the alarm clock kicking in at 3.30

5
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,980
to go off to the radio show which went well.

6
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,180
I had to come home pretty quickly because the people I told you about who come to see the

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:49,180
house twice already, well they wanted to come today for the third and final time and so

8
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,860
it looks like they're all just about set to make an offer.

9
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:58,660
So hopefully stuff will move along and we can move on with our plans.

10
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,020
So today is going to be a little bit of a short.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
version of source code because after I got home, remember this is about an hour and a half drive,

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,360
and there was also an accident on the highway, so it took about two hours to get home. Then we had

13
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:23,200
to go check out Christina's new school, which is in Antwerp, the international school or the Antwerp

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,400
International School, which will be going to at least for the next couple of months. Excuse me?

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:55,040
No. Batteries? Van lights? Christina, how are you? It's medium open, how much car? It's real. Okay.

16
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Okay.

17
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
I'm not going to do it.

18
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
No, I'm not.

19
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,500
No, I'm not.

20
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
I'm not.

21
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,500
I'm not going to do it.

22
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,500
I'm not going to do it.

23
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I'm not going to do it.

24
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
I'm not going to do it.

25
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,500
I'm not going to do it.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,500
Sorry.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,680
This cracks me up. That was my wife Patricia who just walked in. She knows what I'm doing.

28
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,840
She knows I'm recording and still she'll insist to come in and try and just mess me

29
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,980
up, which is really part of the theme I wanted to talk about today. I found the interesting

30
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:41,880
blog post from Dave Slusher from the Evil Genius Chronicles at evilgeniuscronicles.org.

31
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:48,640
And I know that he had tried out my iPod or script and he sent me a note. I think he

32
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,000
dropped me a comment on my web blog and he said that he had created a Pearl script version

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,860
that does the same thing. Only his was somewhat more complete where you just throw a text

34
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,360
file in with the URLs to the feeds that you subscribe to you want to subscribe to and

35
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:15,080
get the MP3s from. So you can configure that kind of manually. And his already runs automatically

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,120
through a Cron script.

37
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,340
because he's running it on a Mac.

38
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,620
So his pro script is called get underscore enclosures.pl.

39
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,060
And I'm writing up a whole kind of an essay about

40
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,860
what Steve Gilmore calls the iPod platform.

41
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,340
And so now that we also have the IPHP,

42
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,060
IPH Potter, which is built in a PHP.

43
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,260
So I got to build a little directory to all of that.

44
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,980
But as I said, it took us a long time

45
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,260
to get back through traffic from the school,

46
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,100
from our meeting with the principal

47
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,260
and some of the staff and faculty there.

48
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,420
So then I got back and I found that Dave Slosher's script

49
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,380
was done, I downloaded it, it works,

50
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,980
it's extremely cool and I will post about that.

51
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,140
But maybe even more funny is how,

52
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,140
he's audio blogging his evil genius chronicles.

53
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,620
And I'm gonna play a little excerpt from that.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
where, well, you listen to it and then you'll see what I mean.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Hold on.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Interestingly enough, my wife, who tends to be a skeptic about these kinds of things,

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
when I said something about the audio blog, made the statement,

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
what are you saying that's so important you need to do this audio blog?

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Which actually, you know, is a reasonable question to ask and a reasonable thing to examine.

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Ultimately, I think the deal is that there's no real need that's an orthogonal access to the real question.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The question is not what's so important.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You know, we're not audio blogging because it's so important.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We're audio blogging because it's another tool in the toolkit.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's another different, you know, interesting kind of novel way of interacting with people.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And one of the things that gets lost in a lot of online communication,

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
textual communication is nuance in people's voice.

67
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:27,500
and you lose a lot of humor of stuff because you don't hear people laugh and you don't kind of hear the sarcastic tone of voice.

68
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:34,500
And so this is just a different interesting way to form connections between people.

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:43,500
So there's actually a gap in here that's missing where my wife came by and rolled her eyes at me as I'm doing this.

70
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:50,500
And so you know she generally tends to think that most of the stuff is kind of dumb.

71
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,500
And I can't necessarily say that that's wrong.

72
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:03,500
It's important to remember that you know for as self-important as bloggers tend to be about the blogosphere,

73
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:10,500
99% of anyone you will ever meet think that you're full of shit.

74
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:18,500
So that's an important kind of grounding thing that we need to keep that we think we're bringing about the Infatopia

75
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
and everyone else thinks we're a jack-off.

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,200
So, you know, gotta keep the perspective.

77
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,080
I actually made notes for this one because I wanted to do it.

78
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,440
Okay, so it was interesting that I actually pulled that excerpt from his blog post from

79
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,040
yesterday from the 22nd, because he has exactly the same thing at home, whereas wife walks

80
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,120
in, rolls her eyes, like, you know, you're fucking crazy.

81
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,080
What are you doing talking to yourself?

82
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,160
Who are you talking to and how are you going to make money on this?

83
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,640
Is this what you're going to do with the rest of your life?

84
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,760
Well, clearly, if we both had the same situation, we found each other so quickly in the game,

85
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:01,360
there's gotta be more of us and there's stuff to be done, I presume.

86
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,600
So right, oh yes, I wanted to give you a song of the day.

87
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:15,440
This is from Dutch band, jazz rock, a whole bunch of different things.

88
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,040
They did play at the Nord Sea Jazz Festival.

89
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,400
I think it was not this year, not this past show, but the year before that.

90
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,500
And this is from... I think the only album released.

91
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,500
And I've linked to it before on my blog.

92
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
This one's called How the Wind Bluffs.

93
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Check it out.

94
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,500
And we're coming blue in the house.

95
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,500
I see a little girl.

96
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,500
She won the stool world.

97
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,500
But something's wrong with her.

98
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,500
She walks barefoot with a turd.

99
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,500
A young child without a home.

100
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Sniffs go to carry on.

101
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Why should we cry for him?

102
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
We just... a j-woke.

103
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
And I talk about the wind move.

104
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,500
I don't know if this is bad or no.

105
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
This is so sad.

106
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
How the wind blows.

107
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
I don't know.

108
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,240
This is Batchoo, this is so sad too

109
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:36,400
There is this little boy, he's just a living time

110
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,200
No mane on holiday

111
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,400
Pays my, it's okay

112
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,200
How the wind blows, and I don't know

113
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,000
This is Batchoo, this is so sad too

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,800
How the wind blows, and I don't know

115
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,400
This is Batchoo, this is so sad too

116
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,000
And I don't know

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This is Batchoo, this is so sad too

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I don't know

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is Batchoo, this is so sad too

120
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Start moving and keep me Somewhere I am a few Ten thousand bodies, cut by the enemy.

121
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
So cold but...

122
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,500
I am a few Ten thousand bodies, cut by the enemy.

123
00:09:35,500 --> 00:10:01,500
I am a few Ten thousand bodies, cut by the enemy.

124
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:21,000
How the wind blows, I don't know this is bad, you know this is so sad, you know how the wind blows, I don't know this is sad, you know this is so bad, you know

125
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So sad to know

126
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:49,900
Look in the industry...

127
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,860
chat Mia

128
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:04,560
It's a sad thing, but you're welcome.

129
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,940
mode Jones how the wind blows

130
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,740
yeah man never bother

131
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:23,340
that their entire album by the way was recorded all on a Macintosh using Pro Tools did at

132
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:29,380
their house in their attic these guys really are starving musicians had them on the radio

133
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:34,060
show a couple times and they're great and power to them I think they make some really

134
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:41,300
great tunes oh by the way hope you've noticed that my audio is no longer crackling the quality

135
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:48,380
should be a little bit higher I'm using a combination of two programs that basically give me what

136
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:54,300
I want one of them is a wiretap which allows me to record the audio from any application

137
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:02,220
there are a couple of different programs that do that like audio hijack and there's a program

138
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,980
that I found. It's not perfect, but it points out to me

139
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,680
through a comment on my blog post about better software for audio blogs. It's called Live

140
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,800
L-I-V-E is for the Macintosh and it does give me the ability to input my microphone

141
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:26,200
and makes tracks. I can even actually assign keys to different clips to play. Yeah, I

142
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,400
mean, there's a few, it's definitely an overly complicated interface for someone who's just

143
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,780
doing simple blogging stuff. But if you could switch between a real simple version of this

144
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:41,220
interface with what's running underneath and then this more vast expanded one that would

145
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,700
be perfect. Now, of course, the drawback to this is it only works with AIFF files and

146
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,400
not with MP3s. So first you have to convert any MP3s who want to play to AIFF and then

147
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,960
you have to import them. So it gets to be a little bit of an ordeal, but we're getting

148
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:02,840
closer. And with that, I'd say we're going to wrap up this version of the daily source

149
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,840
code. Again, there's an essay coming about the iPod or

150
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:14,100
Or the iPod platform and the different versions of iPod are there now out there and

151
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:21,240
You know hopefully how we're getting close to creating something so I will talk to you tomorrow as we

152
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,020
But what is tomorrow is tomorrow be Wednesday hump day? I'll see you then

153
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:53,960
The power of the sword is not.

154
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
I
