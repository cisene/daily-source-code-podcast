Restoration of DSC, Daily Source Code Podcast RSS feed


An attempt at restoring part or fragments of the DSC feed, through bits and pieces through internet archeology, google-fu and brute-force, piece together what would be similar but not necessarily identical to what the original DSC RSS feed looked like.

It is an impossible task, but the impossible just takes a little longer ...


## Internet archeology
By scouring sources, some fragments has been found. A combination of sources and fragments could be used to rebuild parts.



### The first Pocasting app, Adam Curry's script

Yeah, we dug up the first podcasting application, the little piece of software that automated the task of watching a folder and moving downloaded MP3's onto Adam's iPod .. "Automagically". You can find the source code in Applescript along with the writeup: [iPod](./iPod/) 



## Contribute
I'd happily accept Pull-requests. Add, correct, adjust or tweak anothing that you know or have fact, evidence for.



## Timeline
To get a better picture and something to reference to, a timeline has been established a [DSC - Timeline](dsc-timeline.md).



## Current status
